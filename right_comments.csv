I hope no one's killed. Hope we leave Iraq and Aghanistan for good.

A bunch of dead Iraqis so far.  Guess Iran wants war with Iraq as well.
Now reporting 0 Iraqi casualties.
"Great, if true. Now leave the damn country!"
"That would be the dream. It's quite unfortunate that foreign policy is a bit of a zero sum thing, where pulling out leaves enemies to push in."
"No American casualties, apparently."
Very good to hear
Big if true. Sucks for the Iraqi's that Iran killed tho.
"EDIT: anyone else hearing zero Iraqi deaths too? Technically ""casualties"" includes injury, maybe they didn't achieve any deaths at all. Just a face saving volley of 15 missiles (of which 4 failed)."
No Iraqi casualties.
Rocket attacks near Erbil apparently hit empty fields - inc unexploded rocket near airport. No attack on US consulate. 
Sounds like they deliberately missed. Looks like Iran's talk is tough but their walk is away. Always possible it's a feint though.
or just not accurate in the first place
"Some reports now that Iran informed Iraq well enough in advance and actually told them exactly which bases they'd ""target"". Doesn't seem to me like they wanted any casualties at all."
Yeah. I think we take for granted how trivial it is for the US to slip a missile up a car's tailpipe from 200 miles away.
Sounds like they deliberately missed.
50/50. Their longer range ballistic missiles like the Shahab 3 are only accurate to within a kilometer.
"It's pretty typical, but this seems to be another civil turned proxy war thing."
Hopefully the Iraqis will be pushing to get Iranian influence out of their country. And all the shit stains who virtue signal voted to force the U.S. out should be recalled.
That's really all I care about
"So, this was a propaganda move. One of two things happens:"
"A - Trump doesn't retaliate because the attack wasn't significant. Iranian domestic media circulates launch pictures and claims ""victory"" and that they have ""avenged"" their lost terrorist scumbag."
"B - Trump retaliates. Iranian foreign media assets circulate narrative of ""disproportionate retaliation"" over the fact that infinitely more Iranians were killed by the U.S. response than the initial Iranian ""attack."""
"This is pure posturing. The question is whether this was a move to save face before reaching a settlement with the US where both sides claim to have ""won,"" while de-escalating - or if this is a move to posture politically in Iran and Iraq and set up for further conflicts and provocations."
Can someone justify why we are still in  Iraq? Call me Ron Paul but I think we should bring our boys home.
"We were in Iraq to train Iraqi troops and provide air support for anti ISIS ops.  Only around 5,000 troops.  And yes they should come home.  Iran attacked them after Anti-Irain protestors were murdered in the streets of Iraq over the Iranian take over of the Iraqi goverment.  They needed a distraction so they murdered an American."
"We're in Iraq because the last time we left ISIS happened, and its terrorism reached our shores."
its terrorism reached our shores.
What did I miss?
"Pulse night club, San Bernadino, and that one terrorist who attacked some event mocking muhammed in Texas... Didn't end well for that guy."
Edit: There was also New York where that guy mowed down some people in a flat bed truck.
that's not isis. that's lunatics engaging in senseless violence and isis saying 'sick bro'.
Those attacks were all inspired and/ or linked to ISIS.
"yeah, being inspired by isis is not isis in the usa. they are distinctly different things."
"No they aren't. You let the cancerous ideology strengthen overseas and it emboldens lunatics at home.  ISIS isn't just a plot of land, it's an ideology, one that exists within our borders as well. Even if you want to ignore the homegrown attacks, they kidnapped and killed OUR citizens overseas.  No true American would ignore those attrocities."
and/ or linked to ISIS.
Maybe try reading the whole sentence?
"Why don't people believe others are part of ISIS when they join ISIS facebook groups, have phone records to numbers associated with known members of ISIS, and then they shout ""god is great"" just before killing a bunch of people and themselves?"
that's lunatics engaging in senseless violence
"Yeah. They're in ISIS. Sort of the name of the game. Do you think you get a merit badge and a cap when you join? No. They don't operate like normal organized fighting forces unless they encounter an actual front. They have terror cells which encourage homicidal, often suicidal behavior."
We were well on our way out when ISIS kicked it into high gear; drew us right back in.
I know many will disagree with me but I think we should of let Isreal handle these situations which I believe they would happily if we let them.  It is their backyard and neighbors. We can support them but I don't think we need troops on the ground.

I agree but if we leave now Iran will just take it over.
Do you remember what happened when Obama pulled out of Iraq? ISIS happened
"There’s zero justification for being in Iraq. I’ve been in favor of leaving every day for the last ten years, except today. Today I am not in favor of leaving."
"We are in Iraq because leaving the country would create a power vacuum, Barack. This power vacuum would be filled by Iran or by people who are worse than Iran."
"I used to be Ron Paul guy with the anti-interventionism stuff when I was younger but now I fully believe that American influence/interventionism around the world is good. Surely there are failures of our foreign policy like Iraq (more looking like failure anyway) but we also have many successful countries we consider allies today like Japan and South Korea. Why are we in Iraq? Because if we pull out, Iraq will surely be absorbed into Iranian/Russian influence and will destabilize the whole region, threaten our ally Israel and others."
"i think a lot of people involved think that the usa had good intentions, but it's more about establishing american influence in the region for economic gain. the neocons making the calls are fully in it for the benjamins."
"paul is right, the usa should be focusing on its domestic issues and stop interfering in world affairs. too many mistakes keep getting made and each 'solution' brings a new problem that just creates hardened warriors who hate american presence in their country and will fight. "
"i dont understand how americans can be proud of their own anti imperial history, and then think they have the right to lean on other countries."
"saying that russian influence would destabilise the region doesn't make sense when the region is already destabilised. iraq is a natural allie of iran, syria, the caucuses and subsequently russia. just leave them to their friends"
With all due respect.  We that sign up to join the militaty know what we are getting in to.
"I understand the sentiment but it is common for us to occupy a country after war.  (Germany, Japan)"
To help ensure stability and that another ISIS doesn't form. Obama did indeed fully pull out of Iraq when he told it was a dumb idea. It resulted in ISIS forming and years more war.
<strong>(All of this is according to the article posted above)</strong>
<strong>Article as of 18:34 on 7/1/20:</strong>
"Missiles were fired early Wednesday in multiple locations across Iraq, a senior U.S. military source in the country told Fox News, describing it as a series of attacks on U.S. forces from Iran."
President was aware at the time.
<strong><del>--------------------------</del></strong>
<strong>Update as of 18:45 on 7/1/20:</strong>
"The source told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin: ""Under missile attack from Iran. These are either cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles. All over the country."" The missiles struck near Al Assad Air Base in Anbar, among other locations. There was no immediate word on injuries or damage.  "
"Meantime, Iran state TV claimed Tehran launched ""tens"" of surface-to-surface missiles at Iraq's Ain Assad air base housing U.S. troops."
"""tens"" of missiles most likely seems like it is just a couple due to how much their state media lies. This might spike retaliation form the US due to the intended target."

- Surface to Surface ballistic Missiles are suspected. This is a major escalation from the traditional mortars.  
- Target was the Ain Al-Assad Air base in western Iraq which housed US Troops  
- President is aware and is consulting with his national security Team  
- Statement from the White House to come soon  
(Trey Yingst reporting Bagdad)
Seems a bit serious at this point. No injuries or damage reported yet so I wouldn't expect a escalation.

Article Title Changed to:
"Iran launches 'more than a dozen' missiles into Iraq targeting US, coalition forces, Pentagon says"
Seems like the Pentagon is confirming that this was a large scale attack rather then a few missiles via a few rebels.
Pentagon makes a statement on Iran:
"""In recent days and in response to Iranian threats and actions, the Department of Defense has taken all appropriate measures to safeguard our personnel and partners. These bases have been on high alert due to indications that the Iranian regime planned to attack our forces and interests in the region. As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region."""
Iranian Guard makes a statement via state run media:
"""We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted."""
At this point the article was getting so much traffic Fox News kept crashing on me

Statement from Department of Defense:
Statement from Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Jonathan Hoffman:  
"At approximately 5:30 p.m. (EST) on January 7, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq.  It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil.   "
We are working on initial battle damage assessments.  
"In recent days and in response to Iranian threats and actions, the Department of Defense has taken all appropriate measures to safeguard our personnel and partners.

"Due to the dynamic nature of the situation, we will continue to provide updates as they become available. "
"Note how this is confirmed to be over a dozen ballistic missile's, not just some Iranian rebel with a few rockets. This was unconfirmed for a while until this press release."

"<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukrainian-plane-crash-tehran-iran-180-passengers"">Update as of 01:00 on 7/2/20 (link to article)</a>:"
A Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 has crashed after taking off from Tehran Airport in Iran. There are no survivors.
"A <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine"">Ukrainian</a> airplane carrying 176 passengers and crew crashed shortly after taking off from <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran"">Tehran's</a> airport Wednesday morning, killing all on board and turning farmland on the outskirts of the capital into fields of flaming debris.  "
"The Ukraine International Airlines flight, bound for the country's capital of Kiev, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters"">plunged from the sky</a> just minutes after departing Imam Khomeini International Airport, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. The crash came hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles on Iraqi bases housing American and coalition soldiers. Iranian officials said they suspect a mechanical issue brought down the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ukrainian officials initially agreed, but later backed away and declined to offer a cause while the investigation is ongoing."
"On top of this, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-refuses-give-black-box-ukrainian-plane-boeing-tehran-crash"">Iran refuses to give over the Black Box</a> to Boeing for a investigation"
"Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Tehran’s civil aviation organization, told Mehr news agency in Tehran that Iran has not made a decision on which country or international authority it would send the black box to for its data to be analyzed, <a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-crash-black-box/iran-will-not-give-black-box-from-crashed-ukrainian-airliner-to-boeing-mehr-idUKKBN1Z71CH?il=0"">Reuters </a>reported."
This all highly suspicious for multiple reasons:
"Worth noting that is actually an Iraqi base, that houses both Iraqi <em>and</em> US troops (+, perhaps, ""coalition"" personnel too). There may be more Iraqi personnel there than US."
So my takeaway is that Iran intentionally missed because they don’t want war. Trump looks like he will deescalate the situation since no casualties and they were clearly just trying to save face. With any luck this can help us withdrawal troops and give the backbone to the Iraqi government to stand against Iran as well.
"It's looking more like this was mostly a propaganda op by Iran.  They're posting fake photos, very few missiles, etc."
Yea they are peacocking and trying to show their people they did something to retaliate against the US for killing the General.
Truth is they are choking on sanctions and their economy which is week now would crumble if Trump took out their oil refineries.
I doubt they want to go that route.
"This is a good point. I cant say anything right now, but I was thinking earlier, after hearing from  Iran and their threat of retaliation, what the response would be? "
"I was assuming they needed to do something, just for their pride, so they don't look like a bunch of pathetic little weasels for the whole world to see. So I was thinking they would try to calculate the proper response, to which they could act out, yet at the same time not enough to trigger the US into a harsher military response? A calculated clever way to huff puff,  hold on to a degree of that pride, and appear to make a point, while still being careful of forcing a large scale response from the US."
"I have nothing to go off of here, and I honestly don't know. It's just something i was thinking earlier, knowing they probably don't want to respond with harsh retaliation, but at the same time have to make some statement to the world and the middle east, being they got embarrassed on the world stage, and vowed to respond appropriately. So maybe they are trying to  calculate a goldilocks response?? Something to make it appear they have an answer. But nothing too extreme, to where the US is forced to act harshly??"
Just food for thought. Well see. And I'm praying for our troops as well as any innocent civilians in the danger zones.
Like I said above this act was to show their people they did something.
If reports are true
"Their state tv said they shot thousands of missiles, and were showing clips of videos that werent even from this event."
They also made a statement on their state tv that if this attack is responded to they will attack more.
Edit: they also claimed on their state Tv they killed 80 Americans and damaged drones and helicopters.
IMO they knew this attack wouldnt get a reaction especially as more information comes out about zero fatalities.
"Yup, I didn't have any information to go off of when I typed this out last night. We didn't know anything yet. But I was waiting and pretty much expecting the report on no fatalities. All of what I said was based on logic. Iran isn't that suicidal!"
Well lucky for them our media will gladly spread their propaganda if they think it makes Trump look bad.
The Media is coming off as really overtly anti-American. That's not going to be good for their image going forward.
"Best case outcome is no US casualties, Iraq gets pissed off at Iran, Trump effectively dismisses it as a reckless misfire that killed Iraqi's, we let Iran mouth off, and we go back to status quo. Even better is we leave."
"The only negative is the press would inevitable flip flop again and go from Drumpf/WW3 narrative to Drumpf/cutandrun narrative, but that is more or less expected from them."
11 ground to ground missiles confirmed.
Those dumb fucks shot down that airliner didn't they
"Considering the timing, probably. Doubt Iran state run media would announce that though."
Or US state run media like CNN
Who cares? Why are we still in this shithole? Bring the troops home.
"Bring them home, but if anybody shoots at them, level them.  Then walk away."
"I agree. Our troops should be not be going door to door, risking their lives for a conflict we can not win. "
Maybe Trump will use more air strikes again.
Thank you. I feel like I'm in crazy town. Conservatives are here defending troop deployments and drone strikes like they are Democrats and Obama is still president. I'm tired of American blood and treasure being spilled in the middle east.
Announcement to be made in the morning.
"I've changed my mind. I think if there are no US casualties, we don't respond. But further, we just get up and out of Iraq.  No need to be there any longer."
It's time.
Lets pick up our <del>ball</del> (democracy and nation building) and go home.
"""The dead speak!"""
"Well, guess we get to see how hard Trump punches back. "
"Based on recent examples, Iran is going to take this one up the ass."
"He called the hit on their navy back before. Hopefully he learned from that and will hit them hard immediately. And only hit military targets, of course."
"only hit military targets,"
Exactly.
Iran has mistaken patience for weakness. Trump was careful to explain the difference but they didn’t listen. I hope the next move is wildly disproportionate and merciless.
Also they were probably used to Obama and how he projected weakness.
"This is kind of ignorant I’m fine with attacking military bases but trump said he would  destroy cultural sites, as an Iranian American conservative who has also been and will stay being anti war this would be foolish many Iranian people not involved with the repressive regime are very western and like America and the sad truth is the ayatollah and his goonies will sit safe in their ivory towers while the good people  of Iran who are forced to adhere to the regime or die will get the butt of this attack it’s very sad really"
"Trump didn't say he would only hit cultural sites.  He said that they would not be spared just because the are cultural sites.  If you are using cultural sites for any military purposes, it doesn't protect them."
"And remember that they day before Trump said this, an Iranian MP said that Iran should attack the White House and kill Trump."
Like I said dude the Iranian government is corrupt as shit and a lot of the people don’t like them but sadly they will feel the fall out from this while the scumbag regime doesn’t get their hands dirty. In the tweet he didn’t clarify that I guess he did later and ya if they’re using cultural sites as military sites then I don’t mind as long as they aren’t destroying a rich and beautiful history such as persopolis
Tweets are retarded for this reason.
MOABs have been collecting dust for a while
Time to dust them off and send Iran back to the Stone Age.
"I think maybe a few more drone strikes, but that is about it. From previous rocket attacks over the past few days it seems more like rebels rather then a declaration of war from Iran."
"The attacks are coming directly from Iran though. That's a different kind of attack, and an escalation. "
"I also think it depends on the targets. If there are no US deaths then I think its subdued. If there are US casualties, the counter attack will likely be massive."
Within the last minute we got a new update:
"The source told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin: ""Under missile attack from Iran. These are either cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles. All over the country."" The missiles struck near Al Assad Air Base in Anbar, among other locations. There was no immediate word on injuries or damage.  "
"Meantime, Iran state TV claimed Tehran launched ""tens"" of surface-to-surface missiles at Iraq's Ain Assad air base housing U.S. troops."
Seems more likely.
I read that some Iraqi civilians have been injured.
"The military has said 6 or 7 hit the base.  If they launched ""tens"" that's pretty bad performance."
"If they're firing Katuysha rockets, it's not awful."
These can't even have a funeral without killing 50 people. Even 1 hit seems like a good track record for them.
"Iranian media is claiming 20+ dead, plus Iranian-backed Iraqi PMU attacks. Don't know the scale just yet."
"Eh, not totally going to believe what Iran claims. I'll wait to hear the Pentagon report. "
"If true though, I suspect Trumps response will be large."
"""tens"" of missiles most likely seems like it is just a couple due to how much their state media lies. This might spike retaliation form the US due to the intended target."
Their was other missile attacks that didn't make it to the news because their was so little damage.
"It's possible these attacks were from the Iran Revolutionary Guard, who the offical Iranian government doesn't have much control over unofficially. But they have to pretend they do to save face."
We will have to wait for the white house press release in order to confirm.
edit: Iranian Guard has stated:
"""We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted."""
I don't have a flair so I can't comment anymore (despite having a pinned post in this sub).
Just ask for flair then. 
"From what I read the Iranian national guard is taking responsibility, who I'm assuming is not associated with the Iranian revolutionary guard."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2CxkwmrUMo"">Iran sends warning to US amid attack on US base in Iraq</a>"
-State media says this comes from the supreme leader ordering the guard. High chance this could be propaganda.
"-Missiles are suspected over rockets, which is a huge change from previous attacks."
"-Attack is still on going, still reports of missiles being fired."
-Reports Iraq Causalities but none of American. This is unconfirmed at the time.
Very large.
[deleted]
I really think it all depends on where they land.  If theres casualties then it changes the calculation.
"Depends on whether anyone was killed in this attack.  It came directly from Iran, and Iran took responsibility for it.  If we lost any people, it will be ugly for Iran."
These aren't rockets. These are ballistic missiles. It is a serious escalation by Iran.
"They didn't learn, did they?"
How many time do we have to teach you this lesson old man!!!!
Unpopular opinion:
"I'd bet that if there are no casualties, that Trump won't retaliate. If Iran backed down and publicly capitulated, it will be terrible for the regime. A missile attack that does no damage saves face, without escalation. "
"At the end of the day killing Solemani sent a clear message. Iran seems to have gotten the message. There will be continued attacks, but it will be scaled down from the embassy attack."

<em>happy infantry noises</em>
<strong>happy field artillery noises</strong>
They had to react somehow or they’d be seen as losing. Hopefully we respond by bombing the crap out of whatever place sent the rockets.
Hopefully we respond by bombing the crap out of whatever place sent the rockets.
That would be a proportionate response.  Asymmetric response is required to deter future bad behavior.
True. Good point.

They’re about to
"Just saying, I had dibs on the A-10."
"You take the Warthog, I take the Abrams platoon."
Shotgun AH-64D.
"I’ll take the F-18 Growler, jam their comms with ‘God Bless America’ and ‘Take Me Out To The Ballgame’"
The proper response is to sink some of their navy.
Worked for Reagan.
I know I’m gonna sound really stupid but like when people were saying sink their navy I didn’t realized it was tied to actual historical context. So Regan sank someone’s navy? Go figure.
"Oh yeah. It was Operation Praying Mantis in 1988. Probably not well known because it lasted less than a day, but in that time we destroyed sank or heavily damaged six Iranian ships which was about 1/3 of their Navy. They had been harassing and attacking ships and mining the Persian Gulf."
Sank Iran's navy lmao
The proper response is to sink some of their navy.
"All.  ...and to take out any permanent missile launch sites, weapons caches, and missile manufacturing facilities."
Don’t they only have 30+ Cold War era subs and a couple of frigates?
"<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Navy"">Not really 30. </a>"
Oh so a nice cakewalk to eliminate Iran’s ability to defend their gulf
We should have done that already.
"I would think that if you are going to strike into Iran, taking out their nuclear sites would be a great idea. Two birds, one stone."
This is the way.
Arent they mostly just litoral Navy?  (Small close to land Navy.) Could never go out to the major oceans
"Sinking their navy is weak, if you ask me. Leveling their Air Force is significant."
Looks like they accidentally shot down a passenger plane though.  Fuckin’ amateurs.
TWO MORE SCOOPS INCOMING
"I say we don't do anything ourselves.  I say we take the leash off Israel and tell them to have fun.  Russia and China can then decide if they want to get involved since the US will basically be saying, ""Ok, you guys want at it?  Get to it."""

We are doing everything we can to make this place a hospitable and neutral space to discuss politics.  But the polarity of what's happening right now is making that difficult with some of the posts in this thread.
"If anyone is found to be violating the death / violence rule of this subreddit, it's a permanent ban; that includes any inferences or jokes about nuclear war, threats towards Donald Trump, threats towards Iran, and so on and so forth. "

Shariablue bots
Iran really wants to play this game?
"I feel the focus should be right now on keeping our boys safe.  Say a prayer for them.  When the dust clears, then we can figure out how best to respond."
No Iraqi casualties.  Literally a wet fart response to save face.
That's a great description of it.
"LOL, so much for WW3.  Hey Reddit, you can stop hiding in your mom's basement now."
But I was told Iran good and orange man bad
State media reporting Iranian fighter jets have entered Iraq airspace #iran #Soleimani #war
"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/aliarouzi/status/1214716589716770817"">Ali Arouzi@aliarouzi</a>"
"According to state media, not always trust worthy."
"We really dont need a boots on the ground war. We should adopt a strategy of, ""You fuck with us, we bomb you to a pulp with our superior Air Forces."" Eventually they will get the message if we keep glassing their country."
There's not going to be a war.  Iran was posterning for domestic consumption.  Everyone was warned ahead time about the attack.
"Personally, I wish we had left Iraq back in 2007. We were under no obligation to stay and nation building is a dumb idea in an area of the world that embraces theocratic governance using a barbaric ideology. I am fairly opposed to War but the US cannot let this one pass without a massive retaliation. I am hoping that Trump and his NSC team will used air and sea power. A full land war in Iran will be a huge blunder."
"We left in 2012 and came back in 2014 when Iraq got their asses kicked by ISIS.  We only have around 5,000 troops in the country to train Iraqi troops and to provide air support."
"Where did you get those troop numbers? The DOD report I saw on has 5,292 in Q4 of 2017. 2018 and 2019 are not available. Additionally in Q4 2018 there were over 6k contractors in Iraq/Syria. The DoD report lumps them together."
Just what I've heard.  US presence in Iraq is quite small by all accounts.
In Jan 2019 Pompeo said we had approx 5k troops in-country
Trump mentioned how we can't have another ground war or Benghazi. I think drone strikes are the way to go for this one.
But on what targets? Keep in mind we have had multiple drones shot down over/near Iranian airspace. I do not think the current public known capabilities make it's a sure thing. Probably some form of cruise missile strikes is more likely. We have a fleet based out of Bahrain.
nation building is a dumb idea in an area of the world that embraces theocratic governance using a barbaric ideology.
"Nation building is a dumb idea, period.  Even Bush recognized that."
But leaving a power vacuum is an even worse idea.
"We had to take out Saddam, so we had to stick around to make sure that what replaced him wasn't just as bad, or worse."
"Obviously, even still today, there are issues with Iran trying to dominate the area."
We'd be foolish to let them.
Fuck
So did Iranian air defense just mistakenly shoot down a Ukrainian 737 with 180 civilians on it? They have got to be the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet after we let them save face tonight
Many of the buildings in that base are now empty. Great work Tehran.
"The missiles struck Al Assad Air base. Having been there only a short while ago.... There isn't much there. It's a SUPER FOB designed for 40,000+ people that was abandoned years ago. It has recently been reoccupied with about 500 US personel inhabiting a very small area, and maybe 2 or 3 thousand iraqis encamped around that. The thing is like 90% empty lots or derelict abandoned buildings. "
"Odds are the Iranians blew up a bunch of dirt and  managed to miss the ground and hit a few of our Iraqi Army allies on accident. Also, al Assad was already being regularly shelled and rocket attacked while I was there 3 years ago, the american portion of the base was defended by CRAM anti missile systems, there is a very robust radar array coupled with an early warning system and IDF bunkers all over the place. "
"My point being, Iran targeted a mostly empty base that was already fairly hardened and equipped against such attacks. Probably because that was the easiest place for their crappy low tech missiles to target."
More likely they did it because it wouldn't hit anything.  This was a face saving operation for Iran.  Trump out escalated them and they couldn't match.
Iran is fucked

"The concern trolling from the left about how this is the beginning of the end times, Trump started World War III, this is the worst attack that's ever happened is just starting. It's going to be a long night."
I am sickened by the amount of Democrats who are supporting Iran in this.
MuH tRuMp StArTeD iT
Literally supporting mass murdering terrorists
"C'mon. I highly doubt that any American, regardless of political affiliation, is actively root-root-rooting for Iran to win."
They're really Anti-American to the core.  Iraniancrats.
where they launched from iran or from inside iraq? when i was in iraq we where rocketed and mortared daily had a 6 am rocket that would wake me up before the start of my shift. point being if the rockets came from inside of iraq not a big deal as if they came from across the border with iran.
My experience in Iraq was the same as yours. It does appear though that these were ballistic missiles fired from within Iran.
so they fired ballistic missile which according to the previous deal they were not supposed to have in the first place. And if it was confirmed to have been fired from Iran its on like donkey kong.
Yup. They decided to kick it up. If they injured or killed any US troops... well... that won't go well for them.
US forces can't be targeted if we take them out of the area.
"If there is no US military personnel injuries/deaths, there should be no response. Both sides walk away with their egos in tact."
No. Next time there could be massive casualties .
There won’t be a next time.  This was a face saving move by Iran so they can say they avenged Suleimani without actually escalating.
"This is great news for us, and we should take it and get the fuck out of Iraq."
Thats what i am thinking otherwise they would have gone all out. They didnt. They pot shot at a tiny base.
"There should absolutely be a response.  Perhaps if there were no deaths we could try for a non-lethal response as best as possible, but we shouldn't do nothing."
Absolutely if there was injury or death. I will disagree with you if there were no injuries or deaths.
"Well that was anti-climatic. Pretty pitiful blundering on iran's part. The shot down airliner just makes it even worse for them, shame about the innocents though."
Sounds like a perfect excuse to waste a trillion dollars.
"A trillion dollars would be surprisingly efficient for a ground war in a much larger and better armed country, with much worse geography."
looks like a big win for Trump and the US.
We kill the biggest terrorist in the world
Iran wastes missiles on some dirt
"So, their apocalyptic retaliation against the Great Satan consists of punching a few potholes in an airstrip?"
CNN told me we'd have WWIII and universal military conscription.  What a let-down.  I was so looking forward to seeing a bunch of 5th-year sociology undergrads try to cope with boot camp.
Sure am glad we're still on good terms with the Kurds.
[removed]
Pretty hard to do that without killing civilians. We aren't interested in killing Iranian civilians. We should target their navy.
We should destroy all their oil infrastructure.
"No, the internet is the last thing we should touch.  We should keep in mind that the Iranian population is largely pro west.  Cutting them off from news of the outside world only strengthens the regime."
Operation MOAB anyone?
I'm sure the Democrats are working overtime to craft Legislation to ensure the safety of..... the Iranians.
"Trump must respond to this. Iran just attacked a superpower, our response should have been automatic."
And threatened Isreal and SA
There’s a video on twitter of some guys filming the missiles hitting. So casual
Gee...what a shock.
Gonna guess this is highly misreported. Probably just the usual small middle crap they do all the time.
So there were rumors of us pulling out of Iraq yesterday and today Iran shoots missiles at our Iraq base. 
They probably want us to stay for some reason so that should give us more of a reason to leave.
lets say it ends here. They did the missile attack and Trump does not strike back. At that point I think this would be a big victory for Trump as he got to kill solimani for practically nothing. It makes me question why Obama and Bush did not do it before.
Trump and American won.  It might be an excellent opportunity to actually negotiate a working arrangement with Iran.  That Iranian General we smoked was big hindrance to any sort of cooperation.  He even tried to blow up Obama's shitty nuke deal by grabbing American sailors.
Soooo business as usual then?  I love how the media is reporting this like it's some big retaliation.  They do this all the time.
There's a world of difference between giving rockets to third parties to fire on US bases and directly firing ballistic missiles from Iran. It is a significant escalation by Iran.
Trump drew the red line and said if any base was attacked and or American was killed their would be a retaliation.
"These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back, &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!"

Rocket attacks are not irregular... (ballistic missiles launched from Iran would be a little bit different i guess)
Me paying attention to the news the last 10 years
Can you cite one so that I'm not talking out of my ass if I reference them?
I’m not sure but I don’t think Iran has ever launched surface-to-air ballistic missiles at a US military installation until tonight. The attacks originated from within Iran whereas previous attacks were carried out by proxies on the ground in Iraq
Soooo business as usual then?

Thank you. I didn’t know about this.
"Yes of course. I meant, how is nobody calling them out for blatantly portraying a terrorist as some sort of beloved hero? I would think the left would be able to see through their delusions just enough to recognize that he was obviously an evil terrorist...apparently “orange man bad” has no limits to the point that the left will sympathize with a fucking terrorist just because Trump ordered his execution..."

"CNN isn't the only one.  Many of the leftist ""news"" sources do this."

"They don't just hate one person, they hate America."
I would bet money that CNN WAS hoping for a harsher retaliation from Iran than the one we got. 
"It would have fueled their narrative that Trump is losing control of the situation, causing American deaths, and plunging us into another conflict"
"Soleimani was the Iranian equivalent of General Mattis. I wouldn’t call him a hero objectively, but he is a hero <em>to Iran.</em> If anything, this is terrible reporting, because the only thing CNN should be emphasizing about Soleimani being a hero is that he was <em>very important to Iran</em> so Iranian retaliation is (so far) proportional because the US took down a very high profile target"
Equivalent of general Mattis <em>if mattis was murdering a bunch of American citizens</em>*
"I disagree. 
See the problem is they have been poking us for a very very long time. While true he was regarded as something of a hero to Iran, these attacks are nothing but provocative in nature. I feel they are looking for trouble. 
They have capured our ships
Shot down or drones
Attacked our embassy
Killed contractors
It was honestly time to do something about it. The time we finally decide to cut the head off the snake they over react."
Exactly. If anyone started a “war” it would be Iran. We responded to countless aggressions and finally put our foot down and said enough is enough.
Even alot of iranians celebrated his death.
"Mattis is not a member of a terrorist organization and hasn't pledged to wipe Israel off the map, that I'm aware of."

"that cartoon is of king salman of saudi arabia. that is clearly an arab, not a persian"
That's actually pretty funny. Good find.
"The backtracking on this has been amazing. Now that it looks like we won't have further repercussions or loss of life and we killed a horrible terrorist who was a master strategist for the Iranians, it's a real scramble to figure out how orange man is bad this time."
A commercial airliner disintegrated over Tehran and CNN has offered SPARCE coverage to say the least. CNN is cancer.
And it's ironic that it's the number one network at airports. 🤔
They don't want people hanging around too long watching something interesting.
They pay the airports BIG money to have CNN playing.
Nailed it!
There are many ways to lie.
Just imagine how they would have painted it if Hillary were president.
"If Osama bin Laden was killed under Trump administration, the left media would portray bin Laden as a Saint. We live in an age of mass hysteria from the media. I literally saw pro-Iran protestors on the streets last weekend, and it makes me sick."
It would be funnier if the guy wasn't clearly dressed in an Arab—specifically a Gulfi Arab wearing a thawb (i.e. our allies against Iran). Sulemani was a Persian. This is sort of low-effort cringe.
The pump action shotgun really seals it.
We all know the Mossberg M500 is the icon of the Middle Eastern warlord...
"It’s actually an old cartoon, IIRC. It’s not specifically written for this week."
"this thread shows that lots of people shouting a screaming about iran clearly don't know even the most basic things about the region, the players or the motives."
anyone with any knowledge could clearly see that is king salman of saudi arabia
No you're just missing the forest for the trees.
Legit question: What is their logic behind this? Why do they paint him like a peaceful dude? What peaceful things has this dude done?
One time instead of killing people he just drank a couple beers and then went to bed. One time. Sounds peaceful to me.
"One time, instead of killing 10 sailors he just humiliated them and accepted 150 billion and a pallet of cash."
Because CNN’s only goal is to go against Trump.
"There isn’t logic, it’s just another method of saying “orange man bad”. What’s currently happening is really showing that the left really doesn’t care what happens as long as they get to say trump bad, and it’s really sad to say the least."
"you know that's not soleimani, it is king salman of saudi arabia."
[removed]
"1) This is clearly a pump shotgun (albeit with a comically large front sight) the pump seems to be at the bottom of the slide, but the action looks to be closed."
2) TERRIBLE TRIGGER DISCIPLINE 
3) Shotguns are probably not very common in Middle East conflict. You'd honestly be better off drawing an AK or AK variant... but those must be too hard to draw. 
"4) Let's assume the artist meant to draw a shotgun. Now, I could misinterpret this as this man went dove hunting. Noting the blood only on his hands presumably from dressing his doves. CNN doesn't want to promote hunting, and instead promotes him as a dove lover. Take that, artist! "
5) Funny that the artist paid more attention to the colors on the artist's pallete than to the gun. 
"I am not trying to detract from the point, but I have yet to see an accurate gun in a political cartoon from what I remember. Have the people who draw these ever SEEN a gun? (feel free to post accurate political cartoon guns)"

that is obviously king salman of saudi arabia.
We live in a society
CNN thought to be 'standing down' their intelligence and integrity
this is a cartoon of king salman of saudi arabia. the cartoon was drawn in 2012 by a marxist cartoonist from brazil. this has nothing to do with solameini or iran. he looks nothing like solameini. it is a critique of neoliberalism and the apologism of the american state. 
"they've made a thread about this over on cth and are laughing at us, but at least they've learned not to brigade anymore. "
please do your research guys...
You know it
This is a comic depicting Muhammad bin Solomon of Saudi Arabia the biggest terror exporting country in the world and a country with full and unquestioned US support. Also the artist latuff who drew this comic is a Marxist Leninist lmfao.
Thanks to post modernism this can mean whatever in the fuck we want it to mean.
"Of course when Trump gives Kim Jong Un and Putin a handjob and calls them great leaders after they kill Americans, it’s totally OK.

Suuuure. "
"It’s like none of you learned anything from the last two wars Republicans started, couldn’t pay for, and then lost."

You seem to live in an alternate reality.

"No, more like a lifetime of seeing my country waste money and lives on things that don't help us and has left a generation of Americans on the backfoot with student loan debt, health bills, and a near 3rd world level of infrastructure."
"We’ve never wasted money or lives on things that don’t help us. The government didn’t make any anybody take out a student loan, and our infrastructure is far better than most of the world’s."
"I think the main problem is that Obama was raining hell down on the Middle East with impunity for years and no one batted an eyelash.  In fact, many Dems praised him for his actions.  Now we have a known killer of Americans getting merc’d and suddenly everyone loses their minds.  It’s just grating that Trump could literally cure cancer and the Dems would complain about the pharmaceutical companies losing jobs..."
"Killing ISIS assholes is very different to striking a state. If I could have had him die from a heart attack, I'd take it. Drone striking him is a tactical decision that should be allowed to be questioned. At least in a free state that can handle some criticism and open discussion."
He didn't strike a state. He struck a terrorist outside his native country.  He led a designated terrorist organization.

Looks like the clothes Iran forces women to wear so they aren't beaten.
"Stereotypes, amirite?!"
"I'm a democrat, but assuming no other military action occurs, I don't see how this isn't a huge win for Trump and the US. Soleimani is dead and there was barely any retaliation. I have to give credit where due, Trump handled this well."
I wish we could have a subreddit dedicated to discussing civil politics with each other.
"(As a Republican) Many of my friends and peers are Democrat, and we can talk about this stuff without trying to sway each other's opinions. Just seeing and understanding each other's side of the story clears a much smoother path for discourse, but I think the anonymity leads to speaking without thinking a lot of the time."
Thank you for your input. These are tough times to be shaking hands with (unfortunately seen as) the enemy.
"Unfortunately, it seems to be almost impossible to have a self-selected community where people discuss politics from opposing points of view without it turning into a shitshow."
"Hatred and panic. And in all honesty, it generally seems to inflict the Liberal minded. Look at the last few days. Its...man its down right sad, that people can be so angry at a POTUS, that they can't even get behind the assassination of an Iranian Terrorist. Now I ask you, 'Is that rational?'"
Because of posts like this.
"I mean as a liberal, I just straight up can't get behind the assassination of a politician of a country we're not at war with, no matter who it is. That's not to say I don't think he deserved to die, he very clearly did. But I think it's perfectly rational to be afraid after 20 years of war in the middle east"
He wasn’t a politician. He was a terrorist in a uniform.
"He was the Major General of Iran's Quds IRGC force. That's the equivalent of Mike Pompeo. You can frame him however you like, but to say he wasn't a high ranking official of Iran's military is dishonest"
It’s  not framing him that’s what he is and he killed hundreds of Americans
"Vengeance is not foreign policy. I agree, he deserved it. that doesn't mean we shouldn't consider the repercussions. Killing al-Bhagdadi and bin Laden were easy- there was no state that could declare war, there were no economic risks, there were no alliances at risk nor allied troops in harms way as a result. Soleimani is very different; he represented a large country with a powerful military and significant alliances and interests with other countries in the region. We should absolutely be talking about his influence in the region and how this assassination could easily snowball. Is it not prudent to consider the implications of such an action?"
"""Vengeance is not a foreign policy"" is completely correct and I also agree that assasinating powerful people connected to countries rather than groups becomes a slippery slope and can lead to terrible consequences. In this case however, I believe it was in the best of interest of Americans (and pretty much everyone) to kill Soleimani and send the message that attacking US embassies and killing Americans (he did these two separately from each other) will not be tolerated by America. "
"I have no problem with defending American interests against terrorists even if they are connected to a country. If no one is willing to stand up, those people will develop a sense of immunity and continue to do worse and worse things. I think nipping this in the bud sends a strong message and displays perfectly what our stance is on people attacking American citizens."
"Himmler wore a uniform, too. He wasn’t a high ranking official of their government - he was a general of their special forces. Mike Pompeo’s Iranian counterpart is Mohammad Javad Zarif. "
"Soleiman’s American equivalent would be LGEN Scott Howell. Except, General Howell isn’t a terrorist."
"Fine, and if Iran were to assassinate Scott Howell, we would likely launch a fierce counterattack, would we not? Wouldn't we view that as an act of war?"
"That's what I'm trying to get it. This dude was obviously an evil person who deserved to die. No one is debating that, we're debating the wisdom of performing an act of war on another nation"
You mean like attacking an embassy and killing the embassy host county's citizens?  Will that also classify as an act of war?
"General of a Terrorist State = Terrorist, In my opinion at least."
"Fine, he was a terrorist AND the Major General of Irans Quds IRGC force. No one is arguing that he didn't deserve to die, no one is arguing that he wasn't responsible for the death of Americans. We're arguing that because of his high position with the Iranian government, we need to consider the military implications of assassinating such a significant target. How is that not rational?"
You really think the Trump admin didn't take all those implications into consideration? They know so much more than the public does on these matters.
Contain your fear. It's Iran. This could wind up producing beneficial results.
"That's what <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> is supposed to be. It says ""This is a subreddit for civil discussion"" on every post, and everyone here knows that statement is bullshit of the highest fucking magnitude."
That sub is toxic as fuck. 90% of people there are having a circle jerk of TDS and the 10% that try to have a civil discourse are downvoted to the point of practically being banned for attempting a civil discourse. If you don’t agree with the mob in that sub you’re doxed relentlessly.
Yep. I actually found this Democrat who was super chill on that sub earlier and we had a nice discussion. It was really refreshing tbh.
"Person first, Democrat second. Politics are way too prominent in today's America (imo)."
"The closest I've found (as a Democrat) is asktrumpsupporters, but given the format (forced questions by non-supporters), you end up with plenty of bad-faith on both sides, including plenty of straw men and loaded questions. Having a community that keeps things open, civil, and good-faith requires exceptional moderation."
"E: I could actually think of a format that would work given good moderation: restrict comments to approved submitters with an approval megathread where applicants will post a high level comment about some political issue that addresses both liberal and conservative perspectives without asserting a stance on that issue. Once approved, they can comment on moderate approved issue posts"
"That would be cool! Us Republicans/Conservatives on Reddit are far outnumbered so using a system that purely looks at comments would be great. I still can see how the comments upvote/downvote could be abused, but that's just the nature of man. Happens on both sides. But having the post itself be a neutral thread for people to discuss their views on is a fantastic starting point."
"<a href=""/r/moderatepolitics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/moderatepolitics</a> used to be, but any more it's just another brigade of leftists. If you suggest anything even remotely center you'll get downvoted into oblivion"
Thank you for being honest.
"I hope they use this opportunity to get out of there. Iran backing out of the nuke deal that was still being observed by the EU will incite a fresh round of sanctions, isolating Iran and forcing them back to the negotiating table (hopefully)."
Well according to the media we should be sad such a great general was taken out by such a boar
Appreciate the honesty.
"Official retaliation, I think it's still way open that there might be less conventional consequences to this."
"Yeah, honestly how in the world could somebody make this into a bad thing."
I'm still nervous but Iran shooting down a number of its own citizens in an airliner pretty much shut down all of this. It showed the complete lack of competence in the regime.
Agreed. So far at least. Trump owned the Iranians on the international stage like he owns the liberals at home. Impressive. 
"Of course what played out today does not forecast what happens tomorrow, tonight, or the day after when dealing with adversarial governments. But the way he handled things bodes well for future events."

"I'm talking about from the perspective of his base and people who may be on the fence about voting for him. He can now tout he killed an enemy of the state, and whether it was actually good or bad for the US as a whole, I think people will view Trump more favorably because of it."
What? So you think murdering officials of other nations is okay? Would you accept if Iran murdered an american official because they believed it was justified?
"He wasn't just a general, he was a terrorist. He plotted the deaths of thousands of people, both Americans and citizens of other countries. When someone is a threat, you have to perform any action necessary to ensure safety. Also, if Iran murdered an American general, we would retaliate to protect the rest of our military."
"Yep this is big for his base which is hawkish but somewhat anti interventionist. I dont really agree with it. But iran seems to have accidentally downed a civilian aircraft and made fools of themselves. So we get to take out soleimani for free. If anything, trump kinda stupided his way into a win on this one."
Yep this is big for his base
"wrong, this is a win for the world.  everyone is better off without that scum."
Yeah I dont really care that salami got whacked. I've got an issue with how. But that means I'm unamerican to this sub.
BWAHAHAHA thanks for the chuckle :)
"You got it, clem"
"jesus nobody is calling you unamerican for not being happy the dude was killed.  i was just trying to blow off your stupidity, but there you go.  all you lefties can do is come here and strawman.  without that, you'd have nothing to fight against."
nicely done. /s
i'm done with you.
I literally just said that I'm fine that he got killed. You okay?
Just his base? Not happy with the results of Iran shooting rockets at nothing in retaliation. Just to show their people they did...something. Oh and de-escalation. Just his base won that one? 
Hawkish and somewhat anti-interventionist? How is that even possible? One or the other. Can't be both
"Tbh, your post comes off as mildly annoyed that Orange man bad didn't fly off the handle and drop a nuke in retaliation. Don't be that guy. Put politics aside on this one. We all win today"
[removed]
"Yeah that's what I mean, we kinda pulled some shit on this one and we're getting away with it because some dingus in iran blasted a Boeing. But I dont really like the slapdash nature of the drone strike. Especially on what we call an allies land."
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
I have spoken.
This is the way
Now the Democrats will flip 180 and complain about Trump not going to war.
“Putin told him not to attack Iran.”
"No - Democrat here - I am both surprised and impressed with the speech I just saw by Trump. De-escalation is something I was truly hoping for but was not expecting. There are many, many (many) things about the current administration that make me angry, but this is definitely not one of them."
BuT WhAT aBoUT tHe KuRDs!!1??
We NEED WAR WITH TURKEY!!! THINKS OF THE KURD GENOCIDE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!!!
"it's all process. Despite the fact that we've got one very dead Iranian strategist and commander and an Iran standing down, they'll piss and moan that they weren't informed"
Certain subsets will even say he was a great guy
"Alright, <a href=""/u/remindme"" rel=""nofollow"">u/remindme</a> 2 days"
Ill say I would be very surprised if what you say turns out to be true. And I wont accept some random tweet from a drug addict in Detroit as your evidence.

Emoulements! Tax returns!
<strong><em>uNiVeRsAl hEaLtHcArE</em></strong>
I find it VERY interesting the lack of front page reddit articles gilded with 100s of awards about trump calling for peace and de-escalating tensions 
Proves how left wing this entire website is
"Yep. Most dems were just hoping for war to spite Trump. Now that they don't have it, they just ignore it. Typical case of only hearing what you want to hear."
"I'm quite baffled by the online Dems stance on all this, honestly. I still don't get how killing a literal TERRORIST is supposed to be a bad thing. It was absolutely justified."
I think the main concerns are that Trump acted without congressional approval and risked a war.
That’s was our main concern. Theirs is trump is bad and wrong no matter what.
I think the main issue is with how it was done. Events very easily could have turned out differently where ww3 started. The outcome is fine but that doesn’t justify the means
"A lot of things <em>could</em> have happened, but I'll respectfully disagree. As a registered Democrat, I think Trump has handled this extremely well so far."
How was it well handled though? A favorable end result doesn’t mean it was well handled.
Well the world has one less powerful terrorist in it and a strong message was sent to not attack our embassies.  And we lost nothing in return. I'd say that was handled about as well as possible.
"Ah, the old...""okay, it WASN'T bad...and looks like it might be okay... but it COULD have been bad and that's why it was wrong..."""
"Hm that’s not what I said. The action was extremely risky, imo it was a terrible choice. Just because it works out doesn’t mean it was a genius move. It just means we got lucky"
"So what you're saying is it wasn't bad, but it could have been bad, therefore it was bad. "
Sounds like Ibiteyou hit the nail on the head to me.
How was it extremely risky? What was supposed to happen? All out war?
Iran was operating in a foreign country under US occupation. They were caught with their pants down. Not even Russia is going to support that shit.
ww3
"Iran doesn't have the ability to win a conventional war and nobody is going to start one on their behalf. The most that will happen is Iran continuing to use Hezbollah as a proxy to make terror attacks on their enemies, just like they've been doing for decades."
"I’m as liberal as you can possibly be and don’t agree with trumps decision but I don’t see how it could escalate into ww3. I can’t imagine there are enough countries that would align with a small, poor middle eastern country over the biggest economic and military superpower in the world for anything close to the scale of a world war. When I first heard the news I assumed we’d end up with a George Bush caliber middle eastern “military conflict” but nothing more."
Trump could take out Hitler and Democrats would still complain.  I can't think of a single thing Trump has done in which they came forward and applauded.
Tbf we shouldn't mess with the timeline if anyone has access to such technology.
I like this reality. So does Trump
What I've actually seen is:
"Because Trump baited Iran to attack the bases, and then had their Air Defense on high alert, and maybe Iran shot down the passenger jet because they were on high alert, it's Trump's fault. No <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-the-plane-crash-in-iran-that-k-1840866906"">joke, read the comments</a>."
<strong>There is a non-zero possibility the United States blew a passenger airline out of the sky in Iran</strong> <strong>last night because Trump and his idiots are just that sloppy.</strong> 
<strong>We really need to lock the doors to the White House and burn it down with everyone inside.</strong>
​
<strong>Confirmed: this is from the comment section about the downing of the Ukrainian flight.</strong>
Orange.
Man.
Bad.
Period.
Could you imagine if we said this about Obama?
Remember that one guy who hung Obama in effigy on his own property and the press camped out in front of his house for weeks as though they were trying to lay a trap for Lee Harvey Oswald?
Remember: It was the Obama administration that put Gen. Qasem Soleimani on the terrorist watch list. But; ORANGE MAN BAD!
Wonder if anyone reported that comment to the USSS yet?
Democrats cried wolf again.
And again even fewer people believed them.
This is always the danger of running your mouth before events play out. The less you say in the present the lesser the chance of looking foolish in retrospect.
"Read ABC’s running report on today, particularly Duckworth’s statement this morning. It’s scathing toward Trump and assumes the worst, and winds up looking totally ridiculous and baseless as the report updates."
This is the way
I can contrive a few things but how are we not basically all saying we hit a terrorist leader with a missile and got away without lethal retaliatory action (today mind you)
The thing I don't get about US democracy is the constant complaining after an election right up until the next one.
There's so much time wasted crying about a result that nothing gets done in between. It's kinda counter productive to the idea of democracy
"That democracy at work my dude. If people dont like the results, they're completely free to bitch and moan while the other party runs things for awhile before the pendulum swings the other way and their party gets a shot. That's how this all works. "
"Now, if representatives cant find a way to compromise and nothing gets done in the meantime, that's not a fault of democracy but of the officials being elected to represent the people."
I can't help but to think some leftest are really disappointed with this.
Oh they are.
This post dangerously assumes that WW III was a thing everyone was looking forward to.   No one wants to happen and reasonable people were correctly afraid of US initiating it with a Targetted assassination. 
You survived that foolish jump doesn't mean that you are clever.
"Most libs were just wanting wwe to occur for the sole purpose of trying to spite Trump. At this point the only thing they are doing is effectively ignoring the speech he made. What are you going about? Also please spell correctly. Unrelated, I know, that was just hard to read."
"The Democrats continue to make themselves look foolish, constantly backbiting and outright whining about things. Keep up the good work, polish up your resumes."
I can't find any news on what this post is about. Can someone explain?
"I’m a democrat, and at first I thought killing Soleimani was way over the line, but then I talked to a guy I worked with, who is from Iran. He told me Soleimani was insane, just super deluxe crazy, and all the crazy people in his country just worshiped the guy. He said he couldn’t believe that this guy lasted as long as he did With all the bad things he’s done."
"Then, I go home and every military man on tv, says it was a good thing, and he was a valid target. Then you put the things like the American contractor getting killed, the embassy getting stormed among other things. It is a very good thing. Honestly if This was any other president than Trump, we would be bombing the hell out of Iran right now. I don’t want war or anything but do country’s get to take potshots at the U.S. military now? Oh... okay so they didn’t kill anybody..what happens when a different country does the same thing next week? Will everyone stand by our country then?"
"Hold up, what did I miss,Iran are  friends now ,sorry dont get to read or watch news very often"
Can someone point me in the direction of what he is talking about? Did something happen?
I found it. Now they want stay and occupy Iraq for longer.
"It might be too soon to wave the victory flag, this seems way too easy. Hopefully I am wrong."
Send in Greta and if that doesn't work out join the Space Force
"Soleimani as a saint? Everything is saying he was outright not a good person and that the handling of the situation is the issue. The issue isn’t that he was killed; it’s that he was killed via drone strike in a third country that he was convinced to stay longer in with peace talks (if the reports are accurate) and then prevented a diplomat from speaking at the u.n. While threatening to bomb cultural heritage sites, all so that he can impose the nuclear deal he pulled out of b/c it had Obama’s name on it."
"Also interesting that this sub is just now hitting the front page consistently, almost like it’s part of a campaign?"
"You have a problem with this sub hitting the front page once a week but not the daily barrage from <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>, <a href=""/r/worldnews"">r/worldnews</a>, <a href=""/r/news"">r/news</a>, etc. with their constant anti-Trump pro-Bernie circle jerk."
"Whenever a Democrat has an ""issue"" I roll my eyes. If it wasn't those things you mentioned it would be some other desperate attempt to undermine Trump at any cost to save their sinking 2020 chances."
"Also interesting that this sub is just now hitting the front page consistently, almost like it’s part of a campaign?"
LOL
There are also reports saying he was in Iraq because of the US Embassy. Like your said they are just reports and not straight up facts and I don't want to argue about speculation. I don't agree with him bombing the cultural sites but one thing are words and another is action.
​
"If you're trying to imply that this social network is conservative, reddit isn't the place to do it. Reddit might be the most liberal social media there is."
"It's not that killing Soleimani was a bad thing to do... it was a stupid thing to do. But hey, just look at US foreign policy over the last 25 years and it's littered with shit like this that has sooner or later paid blow-back dividends. "
Remember .... Bin Laden and Saddam were once considered US allies.
What makes Republicans think that Trump will not try for WW III? We in US will have to vote the politicians out who created this scenario in the first place.
Except he’s actively trying not to. Arguments with leftists are always going to be a Catch-22. “Trump drone strikes Iran” left argues that Trump is trying to start a war for his agenda. “
Trump doesn’t strike Iran” left argues that Trump hates Americans and is letting Iran do whatever they want to the American Embassy.
Ever think that these military decisions were made for the safety and defense of the American people?
Targeted assassination of a leader of the country is the problem here. It puts us all in danger. There is no argument with the left here.
"I agree that we can’t go around and kill every leader we hate. There is some justification for someone that had been on the terrorist watchlist for 13 years and have become one of the most powerful military leaders of the Middle East. The DoD has much more information on this man than we do and Congress. As someone who has worked with the DoD for my entire life, this attack is very targeted. Our military used the Embassy attack as an opportunity to strike not “we strike because of the Embassy attack.”"
"You make some good points. We have look at time line a little early too. What caused embassy outrage? Well, why did have get into problem with Iran in first place? (ref. Nuclear pact). We wanted to pull the military out. We lost in both fronts now."
"Because you can't just go killing officials of other nations??? Imagine if Iran murdered an american official because they thought it was justified, would that be okay just because it didn't lead to war? "
Nations shouldn't just be going around assassinating other nations officials.
"He was with the Quds force, literally the ones responsible for several bombings of embassies, and also bear responsibility for several civil wars. If anything, he was the aggressor. Remember when they siezed 2 US Navy ships and humuliated the crews? Terrorist groups directly linked to the Quds force sent ballistoc missiles at our navy in addition to sinking several civilian ships. Plus, our intelligence has stated that he was planning a major attack on us. It was probably why he was in Iraq meeting with the deputy of Hezbollah. We can and should take him and people like him out with almost no limitations regarding circumstance."
Trump doesn’t know what the quds force is
"Actually I dont remember the ship crew humiliations, or ship sinkings. And there has been no proof that he was planning an attack, and american intelligence has lied before. So nobody should simply believe anything they say."
"Im not saying Quds or Qessam are good, just that assassinating foreign officials is a dangerous and stupid game. That should not be acceptable."
"He was a uninformed General in a combat zone, and was engaged in hostilities against the US. "
At what point is acceptable to target him?
"Edit: Nvm, you don’t even believe he’s affiliated with Iran’s proxy militias. This is a pointless debate."
"You mispelled ""terrorist piece of shit""."
Why the fuck does it matter if he was a terrorist? Which is pretty fucking strongly debateable. What actually matters is that you can't just drone strike a country you are not at war with.
"That country gets every single legal and probably also moral right to declare war. Putin is also a warcriminal supporting terrorists, but I dont see people begging for him to be bombed by an american drone."
"Wow... you're an idiot. You think it's debatable that he was a terrorist? He was the quds force general, which is a ""terrorist organization"". We didn't drone strike a country we weren't at war with... we killed an iranian terrorist that was responsible for hundreds of American deaths and potentially thousands of American injuries. He was responsible for thousands of iranian civilian deaths. He just coordinated the attack on our embassy and planned on killing more Americans and our allies. He was killed in Iraq, where we ARE currently at war. You're a fucking retard. Get the terrorist dick out of your mouth."
"He was actively supported by Putin and the Iranians, and after reading his wikipedia. He actively fought against Isis. And reading through the Quds wikipedia Iran, Syria and USA sections. The Quds did fight the USA in Iraq. And the latest attack there is from way back in 2007. 13 years ago. After that they mostly operated in Syria combating Isis and Al-Nusra on Putins order."
"So why was he assassinated now? There is no proof of any pending attack. Just a claim from the intelligence service, which has lied before (remember the claim that Iraq had WMD?)."
"Yes, I see that you're extremely stupid and have no understanding of the English language.... soleimaini was a mass murdering terrorist fuck. He directed the attack on the u.s. embassy in Baghdad the other day."
"Here's some information about the shit stain. I recommend copy and pasting the article into Google translate. Select ""English"" as the primary language. Select ""Absolute Fucking Retarded Moron"" as the language to be translated into, so that you may understand what was written in the article. "

Why the fuck does it matter if he was a terrorist?
Dude literally what the fuck is this.
Imagine if Iran murdered an american official
Like the officials working at the embassy that Salami orchestrated an attack on shortly before becoming a smear on the pavement?
Maybe he shouldn't have attacked our embassy?

I know thats how they tend to do it. But damn. Unrolling a piece of latex and taking a pill sure seems easier than ending a life that's been developing for a couple months.

It’s tough to keep a clear head while smoking crack at the strip club.

Solid point; touché!
"Hunter Biden, the son of presidential candidate Joe Biden, is the ""biological and legal father"" of a child he fathered with an ex-stripper, an Arkansas judge ruled Tuesday, contradicting the younger Biden's previous denials that he had any role in the pregnancy."
He should run for office.
Joe can't raise a child but I'm sure he can lead a country.
Well then a Big Congratulation to Grandpa Joe on the new grandchild!
Headline: “The Biden crime family expands to include a sex worker and a bastard.”
Which is actually a net positive in that family.
Ouch.
Just imagine if Donald Trump Jr. had a child out of wedlock. The MSM would go nuts about it forever.
"And the deadbeat will still probably fight paying any kind of child support, because of his enabling mother, and his powerful father."
"Eh, so what."
I'm with you on this one. That's their personal business. Feel free to fuck up your own life as you please.
"Wait, who's this Hunter Biden person?  I remember his name being in the news bef..."
IMPEACHMENT! IMPEACHMENT ALERT! WOOP WOOP!  
Love how no one even cares about this bozo anymore.
And? What does this have to do with anything?
They'll have to put the Clinton era stripper pole back up in the Lincoln bedroom if Joe the Sniffer wins.
Color me surprised
Nice job bagging a stripper...now pay the child support that you can clearly afford...then all will be well and this will be a non-issue.
"Joe must be so proud of his baby daddy son who knocks up strippers, denies his paternity in court, and expands the Biden family line in a drunken walk through strip clubs. Hunter is one of those deadbeat dads who flees his own mistakes, and bludgeons those who seek some degree of paternity support in the same way Hillary went after Bill's bimbos. And Hunter has such a great groping and fondling and nuzzling example of an unwanted physical contact Daddy who cleans up his cocaine messes and personal failures with corrupt pressure and misuse of his public office. We are looking at a real royal family here, America, the kind that would keep an army of tabloids filled with jaw dropping material for decades. There is a franchise here. A great beast of blunders to harvest in all its economic glory."

Germany supports this? See! I told you Trump is a Nazi!!!!
"(typical <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> response)"
"Yea, germans might actually be more woke as they experienced a SAMED media"
Did Snopes fact check this &gt;.&gt;
They quoted a Babylon Bee article as mostly false.
"I was referring to Trump being a Nazi lol.  I could see them being “after much review it is CONFIRMED, Trump is a literal Nazi”. And the collective MSM shitting their pants with glee."
"Hey, just wanted to clarify, that the general opinion in Germany about the drone strike is negative. "
"The ""Bild"" is NOT a serious newspaper, but more like buzzfed but in print."
"Most people aknowledge that the iranian general was a bad person, but the drone strike on its own is seen as a huge mistake that is provoking a war with Iran and violating a lot of laws/agreements."
They are the exception though. Most German media is a disgrace. Source: I'm German
We have the same problem in the US.
It’s pretty much ALL mainstream media.  It’s like crazy world.
Is it pretty much the same in Germany as it is in the US where the media is much more liberal and loud than the average citizen?
"You just read it. The biggest news media (Bild) is very fear mongering and clickbaity. Jumps on every opportunity to get views, no matter the ethics."
Most <del>German</del> media is a disgrace.
"Thank you so much for this! As a non-German who loves that country's history, language (and is currently learning it), people, and culture, it makes me so happy to see them waking up and gradually turning of progressivism and NOT SIDING WITH OR DEFENDING ISLAMISTS."
"Yea its been going on for a while, i actually wrote tons of letters to the editors and the newspaper welt.de which still allows user comments also has become pretty woke, highest rated comments calling out their trump bashing which led to alot of more varied, even very positive articles. They also wrote a few days ago how iranians are happy he is gone, and how the protests are orchestrated by the leaders of iran."
"Bild is just writing what gets the most views. It's like Buzzfeed without ethics. Just saying. They don't follow any agenda, just money."
"As an American, I apologize to the world for the behavior of the Left in America. They are holding the world back from being a better place by defending and emboldening terrorists around the world."
"I dont even think its bad intent always. Germans, and our journalists, just learnt nyt, wp, even cnn, are the peak of independant journalism in the world. I just blame them they didnt realise how this changed completely when they endorsed corrupt war monger hillary clinton."
The article is something the US media should be touting.  One less shit-stain on the world is a good thing.
"If a Democrat did this in office, they would probably win the Nobel Peace Prize."
​
"Granted, let's be real, if Obama did this, he would have been called a war hawk by right-leaning media. Whereas Trump is being praised."
"Except Obama DID win a Nobel Peace Prize, for doing literally nothing.  He had just gotten elected."
Both sides have there double standards but I doubt the right would have defended general salami after he died
I said this earlier and the response was that Obama killed ISIS and Trump killed basically a cabinet member of the Iranian Gov
he would have been called a war hawk by right-leaning media
no
"I wholeheartedly agree but this opinion piece won't change 1 persons mind, one liberal leaning media report, one democrats rhetoric. It's really a shame how partisan it is out there."
At least with germans it changed over the last 4 years. Many germans from media brainwashing really thought trump is dumb and they voiced it back then. Now however they realise he is much smarter than merkel and establishment
I'm originally from outside of the US and I can confirm that the media in my country of birth loves Trump. I've heard similar things from other people who are from outside of the US. Pretty much only left wing Americans think he's bad.
What countries media is pro trump?
"I wouldn't say ""pro-Trump"" as much as ""not super against Trump for stupid reasons"", for the simple reason that people tend not to get super involved in other countries' politics, but we do talk about the US because it's so important. I'm Czech, and I speak German. So there are a few countries I can speak for. Usually Trump is spoken about in neutral terms at worst. Only Europeans that are high off their own farts ever say anything bad about Trump, to be honest, and that's more of a ""ha ha dumb fat Americans"" thing than an actual political opinion."
"Yea it changed but like 2 or 3 years ago EU media was all against Trump, at least for germany and uk. And i knew alot of germans who thought low of him because they only got fed the hate. I dont hear them speak up anymore"
Meanwhile CNN is praising a terrorist. Crazy time line we live in.
BILD is one of the least respectable newspapers you can find in Germany. It is basically just a tabloid.
Its the biggest. Who still believes bbc or ard/zdf propaganda? You and 5 ppl maybe.. Ard didnt even mention uk supports trump iran strategy in sunday tagesschau despite uk announced their support 24h earlier lol.
"Why does it matter that it is the biggest? It caters to people who know little about politics and want shock headlines, they have a page just dedicated to porn and many more dedicated to sports. They dont cater to long in-depth politics, they cater to those who like flashy headlines they can enrage themselves over. And that becomes very clear if you just scroll a tiny bit down on their website."

Lol Spiegel. They used to be pretty good 10 years ago.
Great discussion. Hone in on one subjective thing and ignore the rest while you champion an actual tabloid as a credible source.

I'm confused as to why this post is even posted and upvoted here. 
"The post is almost entirely placing the blame on the conservative governance in Australia, which happens to be correct. It's pretty much either conservatives and/or climate change. Take your pick. There is a reason that even conservative news outlets have flipped their tables over the leadership. "
"We can have great conservative leadership or we can have shite conservative leadership, just like in the US. It's nothing new."
No one in Australia doubts that human action caused the severity of these fires. Even this article points out that climate change is only minorly at fault.
"Unfortunately, most of the people here seem have just read the headline and seem to be thinking it's stating arson was the cause, despite arson trending downward year on year in Australia."

This burn was from human activity.

"Except that is one and the same thing.

The article I linked mentioned two important fires started by a teenager's cigarette butt and a military live-fire exercise respectively, and also talks about trains, cars, etc. as sources."
Makes these stats seem crazy?
I don't mean to imply that.  Obviously you have to be hyper-vigilant in a drought environment.  
Those 'not historically fire-dominated areas' not historically fire dominated for a reason
"I wanted to make the point that not all regions of Australia are fire-dominated.  Even before European settlement, Aborigines were setting fires above the background rate, in times of drought, causing conversion of rainforest to eucalyptus, scrub and grassland: ""<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229720620_The_impact_of_Aboriginal_landscape_burning_on_the_Australian_biota"">Burning may have caused the extinction of some fire-sensitive species of plants and animals dependent upon infrequently burnt habitats, and it must have maintained structurally open vegetation such as grasslands and also extended the range of fire-adapted species, such as Eucalyptus, into environments climatically suitable for rain forest.</a>"""
"The killing off of large herbivores by Aborigines has also impacted the structure of plant communities, and in part caused an increase in fire-prone communities of eucalyptus, scrub and grass.  One of my favorite studies, which used a cool high-resolution sediment core dataset to assess large herbivore biomass by the abundance of a fungal spore that only lives in their dung:"
"<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1009.8464&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">Our results suggest that human arrival rather than climate caused megafaunal extinction, which then triggered replacement of mixed rainforest by sclerophyll vegetation through a combination of direct effects on vegetation of relaxed herbivore pressure and increased fire in the landscape.</a>"
"So a large portion of the Australian landscape has been converted to a fire-dominated landscape, either by Aborigines or Europeans.  Fire has taken over the role of 'large herbivore' in these environments, in the absence of brush and tree eating animals.  Controlled burns are necessarily part of the conversation there, but don't represent the 'natural' state or even the only management strategy."
"As for normally wet forests that are burning because of human-caused fires in extreme drought conditions, regular burning should probably not become the primary management strategy."
"You can't regard the whole of Australia as ""burnable material.""  Furthermore, as the links I provided discuss, in times of drought, even a pre-burned forest is not safe.  So it has to be a mix of strategies.  But whatever it is, clearly not enough has been done."
Except that is one and the same thing.
"I mean, I believe in AGW to some extent, but IOD is not really a change in the average climate state but rather a mode of multiyear climate variability, and there's not enough evidence to say AGW is causing it to become more extreme, with good reason to disbelieve it is.  One thing I like is the huge wet anomalies from the 1970s etc in the figure, even bigger than the current drought- was a half degree of climate change the cause of that?  Lol"
This burn <em>again</em> was from human activity.
"Do you have a source for there being no consensus that climate change causes more frequent positive IOD events? <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GL040163"" rel=""nofollow"">Because it’s been known for a while.</a>"
"The IOD was discovered in 1999 and suddenly we understand it enough to use models to predict how climate change will affect it?  I don't think so.  We went through a similar thing after the 97-98 strong El Nino- and growing concern about AGW- caused a flurry of new research into El Nino and connections to AGW.  Initially there were prominent studies that suggested AGW would cause more El Ninos or stronger and longer El Ninos.  However, as more studies have piled in, the results <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o"">appear mixed</a>:"
"There is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence, strength or duration of El Niño events, as research supports El Niño events becoming stronger, longer, shorter and weaker.[20][21]"
"El Nino, however, occurs in a much better-studied ocean basin, and has been the subject of study for longer, with scientists having known about it for many decades.  The Indian Ocean Dipole was discovered more recently and occurs in a less-well-studied ocean basin.  It was hard to get good hurricane tracking data on the recent, unusual spate of hurricanes the current positive IOD spawned in the southwestern Indian Ocean, for example.  Overall, there has been less research on the IOD, although I'm sure that will now change."
"The Indian Ocean Dipole functions much like La Nina/El Nino, since both are driven by equatorial winds/SSTs, with teleconnections, the weather heat pump, and the Coriolis spreading the effects farther afield.  During one phase of each, warm waters and storms collect at the west end of the ocean basin (La Nina/positive phase IOD), compared to the opposite phase, which increases SSTs and storms/rainfall to the eastern and central reaches of the ocean basin (El Nino/negative phase IOD).  Australia is wetter under La Nina- since it is at the west end of the Pacific- and is wetter under negative phase IOD, since it is at the east of the Indian Ocean."
"Unfortunately for Australia, there has been a mild El Nino event and a strong positive phase IOD, meaning warm water/storms have been more in the eastern/central Pacific and western Indian Ocean respectively."
"It's also worth noting that a popular mode of climate change-induced effects on El Nino is a permanent or semi-permanent El Nino- a drier Australia.  However, <strong>transferring the same oceanographic mechanisms entailed in a permanent Pacific El Nino to the Indian Ocean would mean a *negative phase IOD- and a wetter Australia.</strong>*"
Edit: I also like this quote: 
"""The occurrence of consecutive positive IOD events is extremely rare with only two such events recorded, <strong>1913–1914</strong> and the <strong>three consecutive events from 2006 to 2008</strong> which preceded the Black Saturday bushfires. <strong>Modelling suggests that consecutive positive events could be expected to occur twice over a 1,000-year period.</strong> """
"So modelling suggests that three consecutive events should occur twice a millenium, but they actually have occurred twice a century- including one in 1913, before significant industrial AGW.  First of all, the likelihood of the once a millenium event happening when we could observe it within the past century is 20%- but then we have another on top? Perhaps models don't have the best handle on the IOD yet."
"Probably because we are all tired of the doomsday climate articles there is tenuous connection at best between climate change and wildfires. The rise in wildfires comes from better stat keeping and much worse fire mitigation practices here, especially in California. "
Also you are right bad leaders are bad.
"The rise in wildfires comes from better stat keeping and much worse fire mitigation practices here, especially in California."
"this isn't really the case in Australia. Because a vast overwhelming majority of the entire country is susceptible to wildfires, we've had pretty much the same stat tracking in place for well over a decade now. "
"I don't really agree with the doomsday climate articles either, and they are VERY tiresome, I definitely believe climate change exists, and it no doubt has been somewhat exacerbated by our actions, however I also believe in the cyclical nature of the planet, and that we have likely been through similar climate change events in the past, and will again. "
"Climate change definitely has an impact on the length of our fire season here in Australia, unfortunately not mitigated in this instance thanks to incompetent leadership. Where I disagree with many non-conservatives, and unfortunately some conservatives, is the leading causes for it."
"Tenuous link? Got a source that supports that? <a href=""https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/will-global-warming-produce-more-frequent-and-more-intense-wildfires?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products"" rel=""nofollow"">Because the consensus is that fire occurrence increases with climate change.</a> Also, the number of fires is less of an issue than size of area burned, <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires/amp"" rel=""nofollow"">And researchers say that most historical data on area burned is inaccurate</a> and that <a href=""https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">area burned has increased with climate change.</a>"
It is out there but sorry I work and dont have time to get the info I based my words on so if you want to dismiss me I understand.
The fact check website you sent me quotes a scientist they talked to. Okay I'm a climate scientist and yes you will see data that showed burn area per year rise with the co2 levels but when you look into where there is a sharp increase it appears to be controlled by mitigation policy. Now I am talking about data i looked at in California specifically. 
"I would also like to let you know that the vitriol you are met with when you present a conservative viewpoint in <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> is the same you experience in academia when you posit a question that challenges the ""consensus"" so using consensus in this regard can be dangerous. "
"Look science is hard there are lots of things that can be related causal, look causal and not be. Plus funding only comes a certain way. And people get forced out before the PhD level if they can't get funding from the advisors and departments that want you to follow consensus. "
All that to say those are my interpretations from my understanding of geoscience and the data collected.
What data? The data doesn’t reflect your opinion.
So the conservatives were the 160 people arrested for arson? Were they the ones that made laws against clearing the brush? Sounds more like ECO terrorism to me. Lefties wanting so desperately for their to be a way to blame it on climate change...
It is not correct. It's because of climate change activists that they hadn't cut trees down as fire barriers to prevent fires like this from spreading like it has. One family in particular was fined $50k for cutting trees around their farm.
How did leadership cause this? Did they decriminalize arson or something?
Australian conservatives aren't conservative by our standards. They're nowhere near it. They fall left of center relative to us.
Not really. We are much more centre with both our major parties. the extreme left party is the greens. Far right is one nation.
"We're not talking about One Nation, we're talking about the Liberal Party, which is the ""conservative leadership"" that the original comment was talking about. "
"It doesn't matter how far right One Nation is, they have less than 10000 members and aren't relevant to the current conservative leadership of Australia, which is center left on the American political spectrum."
^ This.
"Even Pence isn't as far right as One Nation, and that's saying something."

Let’s hope so. “Washington Examiner” that place you go when nothing else fits your stupid agenda. 
Since when did conservative mean delusional?
Why not both?
Because Australia is designed to burn and the fires are this bad from bad land management
Could it be possible that climate change could’ve only worsened the problem?
"Yeah I don’t think it was THE cause of the fires, but it sure didn’t add any water to the situation."
"Yeah, stupid nature and its bad management."
For the climate change question I'd like to see Australian brush fire by area with climate time scales on the x axis.
Edit: Downvotes for saying I'd like to see data relavent to the question. Wow.
I feel like that data would be confounded by volunteer fire fighter numbers and average response times as well as funding to these firefighter groups.

"Which shows no trend in damage caused by wildfires when the ""damage caused"" is normalized instead of based on the monetary cost of damage (which most ""trends"" use ""damaged caused in dollars"" as the comparative variable)."
"Once you've controlled for all other factors, such as poor land management, population increase, criminal activity, normally expected shifts in climate, etc., what portion can be attributed to (dryness caused by) climate change?"
"They arent mutually exclusive. Decades of drought+an unusually hot and dry brushfire season+dumbass arsonists=NSW is gone. Had this not been preceded by climate issues, the fires wouldn't be nearly as bad."
"they dont even have decades of drought down south, Queensland has had the droughts for 5+ years in some areas"
What about the Federation Drought that affected half the continent in the late 19th century?
There is tenuous connection at best between climate change and wildfires. The rise in wildfires comes from better stat keeping and much worse fire mitigation practices here. 
Drought is a thing that happens too that shouldn't automatically be attributed to climate change. Also a warming earth would actually increase global precipitation because a greater amount of the ocean would evaporate lessening the length of droughts. 
Also you are right bad leaders are bad.

That's interesting. Hopefully this fire causes a greater focus on the correct burning strategy to keep the fuel load down
Global warming inherently reduces droughts as the air holds more moisture content.
Australia based on geological history has consistent droughts going back for thousands of years. 
Blaming climate change is a scapegoat for shitty eco policy.
Somebody please make a comparison between Australian and American fire violence just like the liberals did for gun violence.

What's funny is California doesn't allow controlled burns and that's part of why they have wildfires.
"We just want common sense fire safety laws. We don't want to ban ALL fire, just those scary ausult fires that are capable of burning down 30 buildings at once. Nobody NEEDS that much fire."

"Although human actions do bear a large share of the blame for the scale of this ongoing tragedy, the cause is primarily bad management policies, not dreaded climate change.  "
this sentence contradicts itself within itself. it’s difficult to parse out.
No it doesn't.
bad management policies are human action.
"The sentence is poorly worded though, you have to admit. The inclusion of the word “although” is inappropriate when you take into consideration the second half of the sentence"
"It is saying the human action is ""bad management policies"" and not ""climate change""."
"I understood it quite clearly. I think you are thinking of ""human action"" as dissenting from the ""although"". Rather, the sentence is saying ""Yes, human action bears are large shear of the scale, but the human action is 'bad management policies' and not 'human-caused climate change'""."
"Well I understood it as well. Still poorly worded, as well is your reply"
"As far as that first sentence goes, I agree that the writing is <em>clumsy</em>. What I think is intended is ""Although individual human actions..."" - as in, people directly causing fires, either by negligence, stupidity, or malice. Including ""individual"" would have made that much easier to understand. It's still kind of a stupid sentence, though, even if you do."
"Lefty politicians like to cover for their poor forest management with the scapegoat of climate change. The same thing happens in CA. There is this really very stupid faction within the environmental community which believes in letting lands go wild, and they are completely out of touch with modern forestry practices of controlled burns and eliminating underbrush. Climate change hysteria drives some of this, because they worry about the smoke release from controlled burns adding to the carbon footprint. They have no clue that in that last CA fire that raged out of control until the air quality in SF was over 150...that one dumped so much carbon into the air that CA in spite of its environmental policy is a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/02/25/wildfires-caused-by-bad-environmental-policy-are-causing-california-forests-to-be-net-co2-emitters/#6e5937ee5e30"" rel=""nofollow"">net CO2 emitter</a>. The left refuses to push back on the ignorant extremes of their own faction, and the end result is poor forest management and out of control bush fires."
"The US forest service does controlled burns. This renews the forest in a positive way, and dramatically reduces the risk of forest fires, particularly in high wind zones. You can read all about it <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire"" rel=""nofollow"">on their website</a> and see that this is a good thing. The climate change nut jobs who oppose controlled burns are the real problem here, and the politicians who pander to them are also a problem."
"Australia is not far-left, their ruling party is called the liberals but are Republicans in all but name."
There are immense differences between the Liberal Party and the Republican Party.
"Like, really immense."
"Yeah but one thing they are not is ""far-left"", or even anywhere on the left side of the fence, as the author of this article writes when listing similarities between cali and aus. The Liberal party are almost universally climate deniers, most are opposed to gay equality, they attack the poor to fund their own fantasy budget, and until recently the Minister for Women was a man."
"The majority of the Liberal Party, on the federal level at least, absolutely believe in anthropogenic global warming, honey. Virtually all have zero problem with gays, they subsidise the poor all the time and your last point is irrelevant."
Be less retarded.
Correct.

"First off to make the comparison it has to be shown bush fires didn’t exist prior to 1900. The mythical beginning of human induced climate change/global warming/global cooling/climate apocalypse. The question I have posed to ever climate change activist and have never ever ever gotten an answer. If your models can so accurately (which they have been spectacularly wrong) as to when earth will be unlivable or human extinction then if we implement every “Green” initiative conceived world wide, which will plunge the world into extended generational bone crushing poverty, then when do the climate change models predict there will be no more droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes and catastrophic blizzards? The answer is never these are naturally occurring weather events that have varied in intensity over the 4 billion years of earth’s existence. Turning the entire planet into a third world shithole not only will not impact the climate one iota but will permanently create a “Green” based caste system where the 1% will be over educated emoted douche bags with diamond encrusted gold cock rings screwing the next hundred generations."
"Damn.  That was well said.  The “Green” based caste system is a term I hopefully will be allowed to borrow from you, because it is perfect."
Be my guest
First off to make the comparison it has to be shown bush fires didn’t exist prior to 1900...
"Dude, wtf? When you integrate a function, you include variable C for unknowns in the equation, such as initial velocity or temperature."
You argue with words nicely but your logic is as flawed as your scientific reasoning and math skills.
"And who gives a fuck who the next 1% in control is gonna be, diamond encrusted gold cockring wearing perverts have been in charge since time began, and its never gonna be you or me that gets a turn. We will work, sleep, eat and burn our free time on our families or vices and thats a life buddy. Whether I'm working with stinky carbon sludge or scary big electric currents doesnt really matter when it comes to my paper needs, but you can't spill wind and carbon sludge causes cancer so it matters to me how I labor for my pay."
"In a “Green” economy there will only be 1 job for every 100 lost. CO2 is not a demon it is literally the fuel by which algae, trees and grass exist the earth has already increased with massive growth in plant life, 1900 is the data date by which all climate change models gauge and completely dump the previous 4 billion years as irrelevant, it is the only way the climate models can predict such cataclysmic change. The thing is you should care how you make your money because under a “Green” economy you won’t be making any. And in the end all the proposals put forward to combat climate change won’t effect the climate at all, so says the scientists that propose it. If all the available rhodium, titanium, cadmium and lithium in the world combined with all available manufacturing of such products on the planet will not be able to produce the equipment to meet power for the planet for decades maybe a century. So eliminate fossil fuels overnight would plunge most of the world in darkness for decades or more. Not to mention world wide shipping, the power required for ships would take up all the available space and weight on the ship that means no containers, no products. Just the US economy alone would crash into pre 1920 levels. Trains, trucks, airplanes all stopped, starvation no medicine (which vast majority is produced in China) But as long as you feel good about your contributions to a green religion by all means."
I love people that loudly deny climate change. Proves me there are even more stupid people than I am out there.
"Climate is changing, it has always changed in the Middle Ages it warmed 2 degrees allowing bumper wheat crops that made the renaissance possible, I deny that there is little we did to effect it and even less we can do to change it in any way. Climate was not, has not and absolutely will never, ever be a static thing. When you figure out a way to prevent climate change let me know do I can check out your patents for how to stop the universe from expanding"
The one thing both sides of the argument can agree on is that the climate changes all the time.  Historical information both sides can read and agree on as such.  However one side believes it's impossible for humans to change the climate.  There are a great deal many things that humans have changed which have had affects on a global scale.
How is it that each of these items has been done by humans but it's impossible for humans to have an impact on global climate?
"Apparently you skipped readin comprehension day. OP didn't deny climate change, only that we're all guna die in some apocalyptic event because too many people drive SUVs."
I didn't know that Australia burning was a political issue. Thank God we cleared that up. Next we will spend time debating whether to help tsunami victims or not!
"The left made the bushfires a political issue.  <em>They</em> made it about climate change.  And climate change is political, whether you choose to believe it or not."
"Science is science, as simple as that. A hurricane doesn't care about political affiliation, contrary to popular belief."
Science is science
And yet the predictions have changed over and over and over and - despite lies on the left - scientists are not at all in agreement on the issue
Do you have supported evidence that climate change is a hoax? 
"Sometimes researchers disagree on predictions of future rates of change, but I've never seen scientifically supported claims that climate change is a hoax."
"No one in these comments said it's a hoax. The point is you said ""science is science"" which I agree with, the problem is even currently there is no majority consensus among climate scientists specifically ( the 94% of scientists number includes mostly scientists who don't specialize in climate btw) or even hard evidence that suggest the world is coming to an end specifically because of human contribution to increased levels of carbon. In the same week Greta spoke at the UN over 500 climate scientists signed a letter basically saying ""the icecaps won't be gone in 10 years because you drive a Hummer but in the very long term (hundreds of years from now) these bad things <em>could</em> happen"". So yea science is science but on this specific topic there isn't enough evidence or actual science to aupport the absurd batshit claims fueling the push for things like carbon tax or that the UK will be under water in a decade."
"I'm not OP btw. And I understand I wasn't replying to you, so I'm just going to ask you the same questions."
"Do you consider yourself a climate change denier? If so, can you provide me scientifically supported evidence of that claim? "
"Like OP stated, science is science, and scientists tend to disagree on things. I never heard of this document signed by 500 climate scientists. One Google search gave me a result showing that it had a scientific credibility of -1.8, and that most of the 500 aren't even climate scientists. In fact, only 10 identify at climate scientists. Of course, the people analysing the paper are also climate scientists."
"Fun little tidbit of info from the document, here are their main points as described by a different article, I'm not sure if they highlight these points in their paper.  My responses in parentheses. "
1 Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming. (Yep.)
"Warming is far slower than predicted. (Can't make a strong critical point against this without reading the document. Ultimately i would be greatly concerned if they're just using global average temperature without correcting for total change.  Some places may be getting colder with less precipitation, and some places may be getting warmer with more. You can see my point)"
"Climate policy relies on inadequate models. (This is because scientists aren't writing the policies. Most politicians just push whatever agenda they want and take money from corps that hire their own scientists to create models. A scientists hired by a hydropower company is going to say that hydropower is great. Same as the scientist hired by the coal mining company, the nuclear power company, and the windmill company. Their employer is the best)"
"CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a plant food that is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide. (Take a look at Venus and tell me <em>more</em> CO2 is a good thing. There's probably a fine line that we shouldn't cross so the greenhouse effect doesn't run out of control.)"
Global warming has not increased natural disasters. (Increased number or increased severity?)
Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities. (Yep.)
"There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic. (Can't make a critical point without reading their paper)"
It’s the <em>solution</em> that’s political.
The way I see it is that we can stop arguing about the cause of why these natural disasters keep happening and actually acknowledge that it's a human problem that needs to be fixed or we can just literally watch the world burn while we argue about why it's burning and the best way to stop it. I just don't see the point. 
"Politics don't mean shit when you are dead, and I'd rather not die from a super hurricane that could have been avoided if we actually stopped arguing for once over useless shit and acknowledged we have a problem."

So climate change isn't caused by humans? Well that's a relief.
"<em>Some</em> of the bushfires were caused by arsonists, while the severity of the fires was 100% caused by climate change."
Here's a good blog post from CSIRO (Australia's independent scientific research organisation).  
"<a href=""https://blog.csiro.au/explain-current-bushfire-environment/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.csiro.au/explain-current-bushfire-environment/</a>"
"""Many parts of Australia have historically experienced extensive and severe bushfire seasons (for example 1994 and 1968 in NSW) so in that sense it isn’t unusual."""
"So in short climate change was not the cause of these fires. This season is particularly bad due to drought, fuel load and other human factors but climate change may make the weather conditions that exacerbate these events more common."
If that's the way you want to think then climate change is caused by humans too.
Just a little trivia from a farmer.
"Just because the forests burned doesn't mean its contaminated and nothing will ever grow again. 
 Ash is actually a more potent fertiliser than manure, if you throw too much in one place it's gonna become too rich in minerals. Give it a good year or two and it will regrow no problems, even faster if human intervention is applied."
"Fires were started by humans, the intensity of the fire was in part due to climate change."

oh shit he we go again everyone i dont like is a bot or russian troll ... smh
Actually the climate change hoax did cause it. 
It made those sick arsonists start the fires to seek attention for their cause.
A lot of bushfires are deliberately lit by humans. It is the severity of these fires that is due to climate change.
This is what happens when you let certain people in... literally trying to disintegrate you and your country.
"Yeah. Additionally, a lot of Australian wildfires are started in the first place by arsonists."
"Edit: Not sure why this is controversial. Is it because I didn't provide evidence? <a href=""https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news_article?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGODIyNjQuaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D"" rel=""nofollow"">Here.</a> 24 people are being charged with deliberately lighting fires.

The Jussie Smollet of climate activists.
Lies being spread by paid interests. Don't be fooled by this shit.
"Its insane how many leftists on site like twitter will just spew ""CLIMATE CHANGE!"" And then call us conspiracy theorists!!!!"
"I just wonder if it's coincidence that all these people decided to start fires simultaneously (or very close together) or is this a manufactured ""climate crisis"". "
Where'd I put my tin-foil hat?
Oh jeez stop your bullshit. Of course it was caused by humans. Climate change is caused by humans you donut.  The way you phrased the title your making it seem like people start wild fires on purpose.
"I believe in climate change and it contributed to this, but these were literally set by people..."
which was literally made worse by climate change
"Hence me saying ""it contributed to this"" haha"
"Same, same?"
Those eucalyptus trees are a big fire hazard
"Wait, I thought we were supposed to be underwater by now! Oh yeah, and leading scientists predicted an oncoming ""ice age"" in the mid-70s, the exact opposite of what they're predicting today."
"I'm not a ""denier"", of course the population of the Earth and what we do is a determining factor on weather and climate. What pisses me off about all of this is that supposed ""leading scientists"" are spreading panic like Chicken Little."
"So, why would they spread this panic? IMHO, 2 reasons: a) money, and b) money."
"a) The scientists who are pushing this need grants (money) to study this further, and spreading the alarm. If this is not so severe, they're outta business."
"b) Redistribution of wealth. ""ZOMG!!! Rich people are causing our planet to die!!!! Let's take their money to save us all!!!"""

"Mark my words, either this excuse, Donald Trump and/or both."
Not surprising in the least
Do we have an idea who is setting these fires? Is there a profile?
Technically true. Due to the fact humans caused climate change.
Why not both? Maybe started by people but made worse by climate
SOMETHING STINKS !!! #AusPol #BushfireEmergency #ArsonEmergency #AustraliaUnderAttack
Fuel load + cyclical drought + 200+ ARSONISTS is the cause

Done...will be interesting to see American liberals trying to explain why an Iranian is wrong about her own country...
"Never mind...it’s been removed, because my account is less than 3 months old.  I can only post from their wire services, like Reuter’s and AP..."
Whatever...<em>mildly annoyed</em>
I'm not that hip with Reddit but I wonder why they allow you to use Reuters as one of the preferred news things. Reuters is generally factual and up the middle in their reporting. Doesn't really fit the narrative they like over there
"No idea...those were the 2 examples they gave me in the message.  It was a bot-generated message.  I was really looking forward to reading the insanity over there, of people who have never been to Iran trying to explain how they know more about the country than someone who grew up there."
Ahhh gotchya! Ya that would've been some serious crapper time reading. Granted all of the Iranians I've met were living/travelling in the UK or USA (or one of the EU states) but every Iranian person I've ever met were some of the nicest and moderate people I came across. Old Iran was really western tho. I fucking CANNOT say the same for Italian dudes. Condescending pricks. Hard to believe the Whole Death to America thing outside of the IRGC.

Honestly im surprised the cia-bezos post allowed this opinion piece
As am I.
I equate Soliemani as basically the equivalent of an Iranian Che Guevara. The media lauds and lauded Guevara as a hero and mourned his death. Soliemani is just a repeat in our modern times by them. Same adoration. Same propaganda. Same pearl clutching.

It wasn't politically convenient a month ago. That's the answer to that question.

Every time I see visual news from Iran they just seem to portray the country in a positive light and ignore this shadow of death that hovers over the countries people.
WOW
This needs to be shared. Send it to your left friends.
"They won't believe it. I made a post in another sub simply stating that this has been an ongoing war for thousands of years it didn't just start. Not long after that someone got upset saying ""that's not true, this is avoidable""."
"Just as an aside,  can we acknowledge how beautiful this woman is? it’s a shame that many of them will never be able to be their best, free-ist(?) selves because of the heavy thumb from these oppressive regimes. This woman makes a case not just against Soleimani, but the assbackwardness of the American left mourning the son of a bitch."
"To answer her first question, yes, they know.  They just don't care.  Iran isn't an existential threat to the Progressive worldview.  Donald Trump is."
"And to her last comment, we love you, too."
Did she just thank Donald Trump? What a racist and bigot. She is a disappointment to all women POC.
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't already call her that over social media.
"“..let’s engage, not attack..” "

Is there actually Western media saying Mr. Salami was a good guy? I haven’t seen this.
If that was supposed to be satirical it wasn't very well executed.

"CNN showing their love <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/03/asia/soleimani-profile-intl-hnk/index.html"">here</a>"
"Thanks, I see they are saying he was a courageous, charismatic leader <em>in the eyes of his soldiers</em>.  That’s probably true. They did also say that he was a terrorist, assisting terrorists and a bad dude. "
I honestly don’t feel this is biased reporting or even painting him in a good light. 
Thanks for linking an article.
"Edit: upon slightly further thought, I don’t like that CNN parrots the Iranian media. They should make it clear that those outlets are controlled by the Iranian government."
"dude, they dont even talk about trump like that."
"To be fair, Trump is not an accomplished terrorist general. /s"
"But seriously, this is one article by one person not the general consensus of even lefty media and I stand by that."
"How about <a href=""https://genesiustimes.com/cnn-devastated-to-learn-trump-didnt-start-world-war-3-after-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-us-assassinated-suleimani-the-chief-exporter-of-irans-revolution-but-at-what-price"">Suleimani, a flamboyant former construction worker and bodybuilder with snowy white hair, a dapper beard, and arching salt-and-pepper eyebrows, gained notice during the eight-year war with Iraq, in the nineteen eighties. He rose through the Revolutionary Guard to become head of the Quds Force—an Iranian unit of commandos comparable to the U.S. SEALs, Delta Force, and Rangers combined—in 1998. He was the most feared and most admired military leader in the region. He famously rallied followers with flowery jihadi rhetoric about the glories of martyrdom.</a> <em>-The New Yorker</em>"
"Well in the next paragraph down - “
Over more than two decades, Suleimani, a Shiite, had more impact than the leaders of either Al Qaeda or isis, which are both Sunni movements, in shaping the face of the Middle East. To counter U.S. influence in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, he provided Iraqi militants with rockets, bombs, and explosively formed projectiles that could slice through the armor of an American M1 tank. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans on his hands,” Petraeus said.”"
So again I don’t think this reporting/opinion piece is overly supportive of him.
Maybe the reporter just saw some pics of him from the 80’s and thought he was a hunk idk
Edit: but thanks again cause this is actually pretty eye opening and could definitely be interpreted as complimentary. I would normally never read a piece like this
After expressing their eulogy and seeing that they describe how he killed hundreds of Americans it just makes me wonder what side they're actually on. Flowery jihadic rhetoric.. dapper beard.. comparing his terrorist regime to the best of the best US military. How is that not supportive or endorsing? Just replace Suleimani with Hitler and Jihad with Reich and tell me that doesn't sound dis-tasteful. 
"Edit: I seen your edit but come on man, saying that speaking the truth is toxic and trying to make it not that bad is toxic thinking. I can understand nobody wants to believe it because it's truly disgusting and terrifying but it's important to not be a victim to propaganda. You're not wrong for questing it because I believe everything should be questioned but it's not hard to see that there is a propaganda machine at war with everyone (not just the States)."
"I don’t dispute that their is propaganda both here and abroad, but also with right wing news sources amirite?"
I do think it’s toxic if I come here with legit questions and am downvoted perhaps it was my mistake in calling him Mr. Salami but that was to show I don’t have any respect for him so you guys know I’m not here to troll.
And besides this article is more in the vein of the Atlantic or the cosmopolitan than actual news.
"I think the comment was downvoted because it was interpreted as a trolling, which does frequently happen. The media does clearly appear to be downplaying terrorism all in the name to continue a political pissing match with Trump. It's a huge game of psychological warfare and unfortunately there are victims on both sides. "
"It's a very complex and sensitive issue so it's not hard for people to take a defensive approach on the subject. The mainstream media outlets are not discussing what a terrible person he was to the people in Iran, Iraq, Afganastahn, the US, and other countries all together. They never truthfully mention how a majority of the civilians feel about the incident in the area. Given that the mainstream is not speaking the truth and do seem to be in praise of a terrible person- I believe that's why your comment was misinterpreted."
"Yeah, I’ve seen several redditors arguing that the USA is just as bad as Iran and that’s mind blowing to see arguments against it downvoted. "
I always thought of them as a North Korea with oil. 
Idk man I’m red pilled now I guess lol I can’t formulate a good response you’ve given me good stuff to think on
"Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's a good thing to have discussions about differing opinions but it don't make sense to go downvote crazy for contributing to a discussion that both parties are engaged in. The downvote is legitimately for content that doesn't contribute to the thread and that's one of the most least followed reddiquete standards. If someone doesn't like what someone else says or thinks and they try to shame them discredit them or control them that's incredibly fascist. So many people need to learn to just move on if they don't agree with someone especially if they can't maturely handle the fact that everyone is different and nobody will ever be the same no matter how hard they try to conform people."
"""The cash payment of $1.7 billion, a settlement of a decades-old dispute between the U.S. and Iran -- was paid in cash, with a planeload of $400 million delivered to Tehran on Jan. 17 2016, the same day Iran agreed to release four American prisoners. A remaining $1.3 billion was reportedly paid out within weeks of that first payment."""
I still shake my head every time I think of that and hear someone say that Obama was a great president.
"Fun fact, the remaining 1.3 billion was paid out in 13 increments of $99,999,999"
"If they paid out $100,000,000 then they would have had to notify congress."
Can't find 50 cents in the cracks of the couch for a wall.  But 13 payments of $99mil?  No problem!
"Why is there no rule that says one must notify the Congress if payments went over $100,000,000 within a certain window of time?"
"Like if you had 2 payments of $99,999,999 (within, say... a month) then that should trigger the requirement to notify them as it’s over the threshold."

"a planeload of $400 million delivered to Tehran on Jan. 17 2016, the same day Iran agreed to release four American prisoners"

"I mean, there is still no exact evidence. We still don’t have any evidence of the money we gave them going towards the missiles. He just made an unsubstantiated claim."
Giving Drug addicts cash doesn't mean they're going to spend it on drugs.
Giving terrorists cash doesn't mean they're going to spend it on bombs.
Sorry If I judge you naive
"I agree with both of you. I think it’s naive to think they didn’t spend any of it on weapons, <em>that said</em>, factually speaking we have not been presented with any evidence that they did spend any of it on weapons. "
Unless I’m missing some bombshell report that proves they did.
He just made an unsubstantiated claim.
1) Money is fungible and the billions Obama gave went somewhere. It isn't exactly an outlandish claim.
2) 90% of what the media says is unsubstantiated. Brett Kavanaugh had his name dragged through the mud in Congressional hearings because of totally unsubstantiated claims. Trump's campaign team was spied on because of  totally unsubstantiated claims. Don't pretend to care now.
Beautifully said
"That may be true, but I'm wondering where else the money would have been spent on."
The money doesn't have to be directly spent on missles. It could've just been added to the budget but that alone can free up money to spend elsewhere I.E. missles. That being said Obama's Iran strategy wad to ease up off Iran allow them into the global economy. If your going to do that you have to unfreeze their cash and give it back to them. I dont take issue with the cash I take issue with the policy and what the end result they were aiming for.
"I mean, there is still no exact evidence. We still don’t have any evidence of the money we gave them going towards the missiles. He just made an unsubstantiated claim."
"I mean, Democrats and most politicians do this everyday. I truly can't fathom how people don't see this."
We are attacked by an enemy and he starts talking about Obama. WTF is going on. 
Next step talk about Hillary and her servers. The game is getting old. It has been 3 years. I want fresh material and revilement plans and solutions to global problems.
Well this got me banned. This sub isnt Conservative anyways. It is Donald fan club. I am a Trump supporter but you guys are blind.
When you start banning retired Marines you may not be Conservative anymore.

"He absolutely has to bring up Obama- for the same reasons that If Obama killed Suleimani he’d be considered a hero and the media would spend weeks explaining the destruction and heartbreak he caused. Trump has to go on the record and maybe some people will wake up, it’s good politics, and the Democrats over the last three years have made this all about politics."

"I was a Cruz supporter until he dropped out, then I went with Trump. Anyone who will walk into the Iowa Caucuses and say that we have to do away with Ethanol subsidies has integrity. I'm so pleased he didn't turn on us like Romney and McCain."
"Romney is the poster boy for the sour losers club.  ""Hey, I'll sell out all my principles just to get back at the people who rejected me."""
I disagree.  Many of us embraced him and thought he was treated unfairly by the media and everyone on the left during his run.  Now he acts like approval from those same people is his main goal.
Wow go Ted
He kicked 'em right where their balls used to be
I ALSO think that this needs to be the tone of the 2020 campaign. Let's quit pretending that our opponents are acting in good faith.
"I will say, Ted seemed like a weazle back in 2014-2016, but he has really turned around my perspective of him."
"I think he surrounded himself with bad campaign advisors.  Also listened to too many ""Never Trump"" uniparty limousine liberals who used wear a conservative face."
Ted Cruz 2024?
"Ted Cruz is probably my favorite person in politics right now but I don't think he will do the most good as president. I think having him as a senate majority leader one day would be great. We need a Reagan/Kennedy like person as POTUS, someone who can unite the country and bring good conservative/libertarian polices. I'm not sure Cruz can do both."
Ted Cruz for Supreme Court.
I prefer Zodiac Ted.

The Obama administration very probably was the world's foremost sponsor of terrorism last decade.
I'm still half-surprised that Obama didn't just give Iran a few nukes to get them started.
"He did. The nuclear deal that was signed wasn't designed to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and weapons grade materials. It was designed to delay it. Everyone who signed it, pretty much agreed that Iran was going to eventually reach the point where the breakout time would be insignificant and then they'd break it and have nukes and laugh at everyone else."
Did we owe Iran the money? Yes. Was it their money? Yes.
Having said that... was it irresponsible to give it to them at the time Obama chose to? Hell fucking yes.
What Obama did was this:
"A multi-billionaire has one son who is absolutely incompetent and is a drug addict. When the billionaire dies, he names his only son in the will but offers no restrictions on how the money and assets are to be transferred. As a result, the son receives everything at once, sells it all. Buys a shit ton of coke and ODs."
Was it legally the son's money after the father passed away? Yes.
"Was it irresponsible of the father, having known about his sons issues, to not put any restrictions on the inheritance? Hell fucking yes."
"So who's fault is it? The father, aka Obama's fault.<br/>
Thanks Obama."
And the leftist media will be silent about this.

"At least they were let down quickly this time. For two years they were awaiting Mueller publishing proof of Trump colluding with ""the Russians."""
"I've been hearing for the last few days how hawkish Trump is and how he's been itching to go to war with Iran, if only because it will bolster his reelection bid. Seems some people haven't been paying attention."
Now I'm hearing how this is yet another solution to a problem he created and that he'll use it as a reelection platform.
Seems everything is about 2020 rather than <em>now.</em>
"Womp, womp.  Better luck next time, media"
They've stated they want the economy to crash.  Anything to get Trump out of the Oval Office.  I have no doubt they'd cheer on a World War if it just made him look bad.
And that's a really horrible thing to consider.

"To put this in perspective, this is the same number of engagements the top NY Times and CNN stories on Facebook had over the past week. "

How bad are NYT and CNN that they're getting beat out by a satire site?

War is psychological as much as it is physical. Iran has been messing with the US on both axes for some time now. Imagine never going to war, never receiving military training, or never reading any military history yet you speak on the issue as if you have the authority of a four-star general. Ridiculous."

It’s cultural. That’s the point.
I disagree with your premise that acts motivated by religion can't be acts of war.
That’s not my premises.  There’s no Buddhists in Afghanistan. Therefore there was no war on them.
Except there was a war on their culture since it wasn't the terrorist's version of Islam. Are you really this slow?

"Some people should just stick to their podcasts and yoga. Nothing wrong with either of those two things just saying, you will talk yourself into a stroke trying to discuss geopolitics with certain people. Twitter is not real life. There are realities that shape our world. Pretending they do not exist or worse simply not knowing about them is a dangerous way to live."

"Lmao stop projecting. I live in the DC suburbs no one owns guns here. I have to visit my uncles in Pennsylvania to do that and even there we practice skeet shooting—not killing innocent animals. In the discussion I was referring to I know for a fact this young woman does these things and she was basing her arguments on ad hominems and personal sentiments rather than agreed upon objective facts. At that point I returned the favor. Immature on my behalf, perhaps. I just grow frustrated because humans refined argumentation so that we can constructively learn new things about our world and build upon ideas—not so that we can yell at each other as a cover for our insecurities. Arguments can be productive if we do them right. "

Similarly to how you suggested the citizens who enjoy their ""podcasts and yoga"" should shut up about politics, I would suggest that the ""hunting and mudding"" crowd on the other end of the spectrum do the same. Furthermore, what I would suggest for anyone who believes in any political ideology yet is poorly versed in the tenets of theirs, and other ideologies - that they indeed begin by shutting up, but then spend the time they would have arguing instead educating themselves on the many aspects of politics as a whole. Seriously man, I wasnt trying to call you a hick, but the same way you're trying to stereotype these idiot hippie democrats I'm trying to show you that there is very much a dumb redneck republican stereotype, although I'm sure you're aware of that to some extent already. Ultimately both sides have a whole lot of idiots and a only a handful of smart people because that's what the intelligence of the entire population looks like. This isnt to be some ""reeeee both sides"" centrist but to simply point out how unnecessary your initial comment was, as the same could be said about any idiots, so why specify idiots that believe in liberal politics? It's just excessive"

"The reality of life experience is if you encounter an individual that looks a certain way and behaves a certain way, and you encounter another individual that looks like them and behaves very similarly, and then another, etc. you will eventually form a type in your mind about individuals that look a certain way.

"I admit I was being immature. That is my fault and no one else’s. That being said I know the young woman I was arguing with—we have had similar arguments on Reddit before so that is a slightly different scenario. Nonetheless you are right, we can all gain more from listening rather than shouting. "
"I disagree with the notion that people should just shut up. That is where progress dies. We are not mind readers. When people stay silent it actually forces everyone around them to rely on stereotypes more because they have to base their judgments on prior examples rather than potentially gain new insights from a new person. I think it is OK to be wrong. This idea that we have to be right all the time is what is killing our country’s progress because by definition correct can only be measured against previously established doctrine. To move forward we need to reach into the unknown which involves making mistakes. As long as we realize we are on the same team—from Mahjong playing yoga moms to duck hunting rednecks—we can build something better for everyone. We used to own people as property in this country. Just over a century later, some of their descendants were orbiting the planet at speeds exceeding Mach 22. Do not ever tell a fellow American to shut up. There is greatness in this soil and the people that live on it. We need to recognize our faults and improve."

-We chose not to nuke Kyoto for example because of its cultural significance.
We firebombed a number of cities that were cultural sites.
Kyoto was on the list of places to be nuked soon after.
How do you figure the WTC was a cultural sight? It was an office building...
Iconic building.  Which is why it was attacked.
Iconic does not mean culturally significant.. the only comparison the US has to iranian sites of cultural significance would be culturally significant sites to american indigenous peoples
That does make culturally significant.
How so?
"Culturally significant doesn't mean old. I don't know where you got that notion, but it's really wrong. The WTC was an icon. Iconism is fundamentally a form of cultural representation. <em>You can not have an icon without a culture.</em>"

Are you saying we should attack their cultural sites?
I am not advocating for cultural destruction
Please read thoroughly. No I am not. 
I am also not ignorant of the strategic role in warfare of attacks on « enemy » cultural sites. These are not mutually exclusive. Hating a disease should not prevent you from knowing how it works.
"Only reason why I asked is the post doesnt mention bombing cultural sites. The only way cultural sites come into this are from Trumps tweet, leading me to believe you are  defending Trumps desire to bomb Iranian cultural sites."
The last part of the post mentions how parts of the media and public are blatantly ignoring prior acts in the conflict in an effort to smear Trump. 
I mentioned cultural sites because that is one of the major headlines people are seizing to smear Trump in this current authorized use of military force. 
I do not think Trump is a good president. There are lots of things we can criticize him on—including right now as we escalate our engagement in this conflict. However I am tired of this reactionary hype everyone seems to play into where we suddenly forget history in favor of the « my side is better than your side »  game. 
"I could have mentioned the use of drones to assassinate a general in a country Congress has not declared war against or a myriad of other dicey issues currently at play but I was arguing in another subreddit about the « culture site » talking point so that was fresh in my mind. In that same discussion someone tried to convince me that Trump is responsible for our rampant use of drones in warfare as if <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/blog/speakeasy/aclu-and-ccr-file-lawsuit-challenging-targeted-killing-three-us-citizens"" rel=""nofollow"">Obama’s administration did not kill an America 16 year old with a drone strike without any repercussions.</a> "
Obama kills innocent American minor...nothing to see here. 
Trump mentions age old war tactic —arghrgr Orange man bad. I am tired of this. This is why we spent 18 years mucking around in the sand in Afghanistan.
"I see what you're saying, but saying that bombing cultural sites is a historical tactic and therefore we shouldn't bash on him because of he proposed it is more than a stretch. Bombing of cultural sites is illegal under the law of armed conflict."
"Trump proposing this is effectively a sitting president threatening to break the law, which will inevitably kill more civillians than usual. Not only that, but its laughable because  military commanders wont bite because, well, it's illegal for them to knowingly execute orders that are illegal."
it’s illegal for them to knowingly execute orders that are illegal
Read the article in my link and you will see that is just blatantly false. 
"The Pentagon knowingly violated Constitutional and international law in this drone attack. They also demonstrably did not take the necessary precautions to ensure the reduction of civilian casualties. Furthermore, none of the targets were ever charged with a crime at the international or national level. They were merely nerfed from the sky. When asked about it Leon Panetta more or less said the kid should have had a better father...oh well on to the next target. Do not bury your head in the sand when it is a president you like. Like or not they all do the same thing. More war, more war, more war..."
The law is a fiction we all agree to. People were property in this country. Why? The law. 
"My father has a saying « the pen may be mightier than the sword, but you can’t write without a hand and I’ve never seen a pen cut one off... »"
Can you find the passage that says I was incorrect there? I cant seem to find it.
"Trump is taunting them, you rube . "
Our enemies. He is taunting our enemies.
Is it mature or level headed to be taunting your enemies while at the brink of full on war? What happened to the anti-war right?
Sending them a message dude 
It’s a good thing you’re not in charge.
People who attack us deserve to know that we will do what it takes to defend ourselves. 
"Trump just tweeted that we wish Iran a peaceful future, one they deserve, and wished them prosperity. If you’re not smart enough to understand the multifaceted nature of what it takes to ACTUALLY avoid a war (which he just did), then I can’t help you."
"Asking because I'm genuinely curious, do you feel that a tweet advocating for peace carries the same weight as assassinating a military leader?"
Do you think that he had not already advocated for peace multiple times?
How far do you think a self-declared terrorist regime should be allowed to go in attacking us before a no-unintended-casualties drone strike retaliation occurs?
"""Imagine never going to war, never receiving military training, or never reading any military history yet you speak on the issue as if you have the authority of a four-star general. Ridiculous."""
"I get extremely irritated when this happens. Liberals and libertarians are the worst, and conservatives are only a little better."
and libertarians are the worst 
"Excuse me, not all libertarians are retards. Most USA libertarians are edgy kids who never in their life touched a book."
Most libertarian authors put the duties of security and the military at hands of the state. Even anarch capitalists like Rothbard imply that voluntary societies that band together do so for self protection. 
"Libertarians, ACTUAL ones, have something called the Non Aggression Principle. Now here is the fun part, many people says this principle fails because there is no measure in how light or severe the answer for an attack is. So since there is no natural measure, if someone breaks your window you are technically allowed to throw them a nuke. "
"So yes, the REAL libertarians principles have a series of issues, but not defending yourself when someone attacks you is not one of the, in fact many would argue that they have the problem to defend themselves in extreme."
"Considering the way he made a <em>point</em> of calling out cultural site as targets, I think he already <em>knew</em> those weren't considered legal targets based on our treaties.  The way he ""walked it back"" so casually, convinced me of it.  "
"However, much of the world has so little understanding of the man that they wonder if he just <em>might</em> do it.  The culture he is fighting within Islam certainly would.  This is just a bit more leverage for him in pressuring Iran as well as his keeping control of the narrative with the corporate media."
"Attacking cultural sites has been a fundament of war since humans crawled out of some hole in Mesopotamia, built a shrine in the mud, and lamented its falling as some nomadic bully stomped it to sludge."
"Maybe we hope to avoid destroying cultural icons nowadays because history has taught us how much we miss their effects once they are gone. But that is idealism, plain and simple. To pretend otherwise is folly."

I absolutely hate this rationale by the left now... stopping the appeasement of a terrorist nation isnt escalating anything. We were basically just funding more terrorist activities in the middle east with all the money we gave them. Anybody thinks that we should have just continued to lick the asshole of one of the biggest sponsors of terror in the world is an idiot.
The deal that Schumer also hated for that exact same reason.

"""Yeah, I'm going to just ignore that Iran has been proxying acts of terror throughout the middle east on it's own people, the US and its allies and just say a 'wuddabout' that doesn't even refute any part of what this guy said about IRAN"""
Classic.
We were basically just funding more terrorist activities in the middle east with all the money we gave them.
I don't know where you've been the last 40 years or so... But the US has an extensive history of doing this. Not just the ME but all around the world.
"I'm aware. I'm talking about the current administration finally saying ""let's not do that"" and showing that there's actual consequences for fucking with american lives"
Not to mention everyone knows Iran are stoking terrorism throughout the Middle East.
*Everyone except for the talking heads in the MSM
"I like how suddenly, because we're unwilling to be the completely uncompensated world police anymore, we're the bad guys for both pulling troops <em>out</em> of the Middle East, and for <em>not</em> doing something to help assuage or at least avoid conflict there?"
"I'm aware this isn't the reality of the situation, but this about sums up what I've been seeing lately on the front page and on MSM. Y'all can't have it both ways."
"Excuse me, what war?"
Good point.
You right
"Sorry, it's cancelled."
I don't get why people think Iran of all places is innocent. Can't keep letting them steal our lunch money.
Well history shows that appeasement works. Just look at how it stopped Hitler! /s
It's as weird as stockholm syndrome.
"Maybe it's because leftists and Iranian leaders share the ""orange man bad"" philosphy?"
"It's funny to use this euphemism because it implies we are helpless to the school bully that iran is. On a global scale it is very much the opposite of that situation. We have the strongest military in the world, by far, number 2 ain't even close. The united states is undoubtedly the bully on the world stage, we have been ravaging iran since the 80's with our support of Hussein, then our support of bin laden, every decade we choose a new guy to support and turn on the guy from last decade. The US has done an absolute number on iran and made it incredibly difficult for the average iranian to live a normal/peaceful life. No wonder their entire country despises the united states, I would too in their situation."
"Being strong and having the will to use that strength are not the same thing.  Iran - as has some other countries - has long known that we didn't have the political will to use our superior strength to respond to them effectively, so they used that weakness of will to increase their own standing."
The news is really simple in their eyes. Anything bad = Trump's fault. Any good news = Trump had nothing to do with it. Orange man bad.
"Zoom out, it goes way further back above"
Problem is mainstream world never really reported much of that.
"The loons over at <a href=""/r/world"" rel=""nofollow"">r/world</a> politics would loose their collective minds over this.  The US is always wrong, always the aggressor, especially with Trump as POTIS."
Does that mean that Obama's strategy of giving them money and not retaliating doesn't work ?!?
"to be fair, this list of dates misses a lot of previous 'engagements'."
They always find a way to manipulate things to make it seem like it is Trump's fault.

What does this have to do with Trump?
Reagan was president.
"Oh I like this game let me try one: America’s executive branch bypasses congressional authority and the world court to pursue vengeance, risking innocent lives on both sides along with risking starting another war the US will be too proud to step away from after losing."
Also wan’t Obama called a war criminal for years for using drone strikes to take out targets? Why is the same action heroic all the sudden?
Congressional authorization is not not needed with a credible near term threat exists.
"And the argument ""a war could start"" is plausible."
But it's also plausible that taking him out saved future lives. 
This guy was evil. Armor piercing exploding ordinances were introduced to terrorist through Soleimani. His purpose was terror.
"We dont know how this will end, but taking this guy out was the right call."
when a credible near term threat exists.
What threat are you referring to?
Soleimani 
He has been leading terrorist activities for over a decade. He has been escalating attacks. Who knows what was planned next.
"I know he has been, but does ""Who knows what he was planning next"" count as a credible near-term threat?"
"I didn't know that congressional authorization isn't needed when there's an imminent threat, which is why I'm asking. It's just that, I guess I thought that you meant that it has to be demonstrable that a threat is definitely in the works, rather than just speculation."
May 2018 -- Trump unilaterally withdraws from the JCPOA and re-imposes sanctions against Iran
May 2018 - Trump ends the appeasement of a terrorist nation
...and begins an unnecessary escalation of hostilities described by OP
"Yeah, we totally should have just kept paying the largest terrorist country in the world for 8 years and then let them go back to a nuclear program with billions of our dollars. Totally full proof plan. No holes at all."
"If you have a contract with me that I don't think you're holding up, so I rescind the contract, would your logical conclusion be to resort to violence?"
Is that how you see the world?
May 2018 -- Trump unilaterally withdraws from the JCPOA and re-imposes sanctions against Iran
If I have to pay you to NOT be a terrorist you are a terrorist.

Are there any unbiased subs when it comes to politics?
"This has been going on for decades... The question  for many people is that ""Is Trump acting rationally at the moment?"" and will his actions escalate the situation instead of de-escalating IN THE LONG RUN."
I don’t think Iran are looking to deescalate in the long run tbh. You’re very naive if you don’t think they have other plans.
[removed]
Soleimani was in Iraq on diplomatic mission to deescalate situation with his neighbors and Saudi Arabia. But somehow it's not okay if they want to deescalate without USA approval
"Lol... no he wasn't. If I had a one way ticket to sell you to Iran, you would be dumb enough to use it. I would even throw in some tickets for your family."
I think the important thing to note is that the public has NO CLUE why Soleimani was in Iraq. The Iranians say it was to broker peace and our officials say that it was to prevent loss of American lives.
"I personally don't trust the Iranians but I also tend to not trust the government either. Hopefully, we will get some details when President Trump comments on the situation today."
"You know what they say about ""in the long run..."""
Didn’t sanctions start in 2018?
"They started long before that, because Iran has been a bad actor for a long time."
Obama just lifted them and gave them $150 billion because maybe they'd stop hating us if we were nice to them (they didn't).

"Okay, then let’s back it up to the money drop in 2016.  Or better yet, how about all the way back 1979 during the US Embassy hostage situation.  How about where it all began when Iran was invaded by the Macedonians, Turks, Persians, etc?"
"But you’re right, all Trump’s fault.  /s"
"The point is, it’s not new.  Iran has always been at the forefront of controversy.  It’s not surprising due to the fact they are one of the oldest civilizations in the world.  They’ve become exceedingly good at pissing everyone off."
"It goes back further to 1953 when the US/British helped orchestrate a coup to remove the democratically elected leader of Iran and install the Shah as a monarch. The Iranian Islamic revolution was in response to this, putting the ayatollah in power. If we left them alone the ayatollah wouldn't have been in position to get power."

It literally isn’t
"It was not, Iran never was and never will moderate under this regime. And paying them money not to support terrorism for a decade is not a plan. "
"Here is a startling idea, and it’s wild so stick with me, how about Iran just doesn’t be a terrorist state and this all stops?"
"Yes, we royally screwed up the warm relations that were building in Iran."
"You may not like his foreign policy, but he's doing something that, if he continues to show resolve, will do more for relations in that area than Droney McPeaceprize ever could. "
"He's speaking their language now, one they unfortunately refuse to drop. This may be hard for all the soy boys in the US to understand, but life here is good and in the rest of the world, you don't always get to solve problems with a lawyer."
"So, we back out of deal we felt Iran wasn’t being honest with, and you think that gives Iran a right to violently responded and attack people/innocent civilians? On top of that, our killing of their governmental terrorist is a response to these multiple attacks, so why is okay, in your eyes, for Iran to respond violently to the withdrawing of a worthless treaty, but not okay for the US to respond violently to violence? "
"Your logic is baffling, and you have the gal in a later post to criticize others about hypocrisy and confirmation bias?"
"Trump hasn’t started any wars yet, Chicken Little."

I love how these memes completely gloss over and ignore the American interference in the middle east (which included Iran) for the past 5 decades.
"By “American interference”, do you mean defending Israel ?"
How exactly Iran stormed your embassy in Iraq?
How exactly Iran stormed your embassy in Iraq?
"Via proxies.  You pay a guy to murder someone, it doesn't wash your hands of it.  You're still a murderer."
Any actual evidence on that? Or it's like with Saddam's mass destruction weapons?

"Text quite literally says the supporters of Iraqi paramilitary groups sympathizing with Iran stormed embassy, nothing about actual Iranian involvement in the act. It's like saying USA attacked Israel, because terrorists funded by Saudis, who are supported by USA attacked Israeli troops."
"I hope this is an honest question. I doubt it is, but I hope it is. And now I hope that you understand that it is true and can use this knowledge to understand more about the region."
It's like they tossed a rock on our lawn and pedaled away on their bike as fast as they could.
"I like the analogy, but it wouldn’t be our lawn they tossed the rock into, it would be their neighbors lawn where we are keeping some of our stuff or renting. It’s even worse for them haha."
where we are keeping some of our stuff 
And if they completely missed the stuff placed on the lawn on purpose
"And if they yelled through the fence an hour earlier to say ""hey, we're gonna throw a rock over the fence right <em>there</em> in a little while."""
I mean Iran would never win a full-blown war with the US.
It might take us 10 years and 4 trillion dollars but we'd win.
Lmfao

"Agreed. Let's stop this here and let things calm down. Soleimani is dead, Iran weakened. Keep the sanctions, their economy will completely collapse eventually"
Yep. WWIII is cancelled boys. 
Someone tell the Libertarian sub they can come out now and go back to smoking their bongs.
"As a libertarian I’ll have you know I’ve been smoking my bong, cheering on the president, and laughing at the “world war 3” panic the whole time. I don’t get how anyone believed that we were headed for world war 3 or that there was going to be a draft."
"I get the anti-war stance, but you gotta throw counter-punches when punches are being thrown. Plus I never had any reason to believe Trump wasn’t handling the situation properly. And from the looks of it, I was right not to panic. We got to kill a terrorist, and Iran got to throw some missiles in the dirt and pretend they’re tough, while we lost 0 soldiers. I call that a fucking win."
Hasn't there been giant protests in Iran the last couple months due to increased sanctions?
"The missile attack was a diversion.  Iran wont confront head on, they do shadow crap like cyber attacks and insurgency.  They can't afford a conventional war with the US."
"Conventional missile attacks are very likely not the end of this. Soleimani commanded the Quds Force, which specialized in unconventional warfare. When an Iranian nuclear chemist was assassinated in 2012, Israeli diplomats in were targeted by bombs in Georgia, India and Thailand months later. In '92, when Israel took out the Sec Gen of Hezbollah, IRGC Quds forces sent a truck bomb into the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people."
"Nearly twenty years in Iraq has shown that unconventional warfare is the only way to counter America’s military. Iran knows this by virtue of participating in this war, through the Ouds forces. They will attempt to play to the weaknesses of the US, not our strengths."
The picture shortly before and after Soleimani's termination:
"Iran - lost a top terrorist and some ancilliary Iranian-proxy terrorists that have been causing havoc across Iraq and the Middle East in general; killed ~1500 of their own dissidents; held a coercive state funeral where 50+ of their own people were ""trampled to death""; then had an airliner suspiciously crash with 82 more of their own citizens."
America - lost a US citizen to a rocket attack; had an embassy breached.
"You forget one thing, the Iranians are not phased by loosing their own people. They are like communists in that sense, loosing a bunch of people for the “greater good” is alright with them as long as it helps them out politically, economically, etc. Unlike us where one life lost is considered too many and tragic."
"I'm looking at it from a US perspective and how we'd evaluate the current outcome as a positive or negative. I agree the Iranians will not make the same valuation, although based on a ""retaliation"" where they warned in advance where they'd throw some missiles and then threw many or most of them into empty areas anyway, they don't want anymore of what Trump gave them last week."
"I agree completely, they have no stomach for an actual fight because they can’t afford it. The regime is in a delicate situation and any more retaliatory strikes from the US would be disastrous for them."
"And yeah sorry to be the person to bring the point up, when you already know the Iranians don’t value human life like we do; but I have come to realize that a lot of people in the west just assume everyone thinks like them and would make the same kind of conclusions and evaluations as we do when that can’t be farther from the truth."
I'm really curious about the truth behind the trampling to death news. Is it an excuse for what was really some additional killings of dissidents or people protesting? Who knows. It's absurd either way. Herding all those people together for a photo op and end up getting that many people killed because they were too packed in.
"Yeah you wouldn't think that many people would be trampled to death, even if everyone was running from something. It may have been more executions and they are just covering it up, it’s probably near impossible to find out the truth anytime soon, but it would be interesting to know what actually happened."
there were simply too many people in the street.  it's impossible to control such a crowd. people died. not really a big surprise.
"similar thing happend during khomeini funeral (1989 I think).  people wanted to get close to touch the ""holy"" man one last time so some got trampled to death..wtf right? "
There are brain washed people everywhere it seems.
"I have to add tho, most people in Iran (atleast the more educated cities) value life and hold it sacred.  I cant say the same for the religious nut jobs in power tho."
"Yeah you are right, after reading more info on how people get trampled and die in crowds I can see how it happens. "
"Also there are a lot of fanatical people who believe in the theocracy. And while I bet you are right with the religious fervor being less in the cities, but the fanaticism goes through all social classes. One of the best examples I can think of was during the Iran Iraq War, where young Revolutionary Guard members wrapped themselves in prayer rugs and ran through minefields to make safe paths for more professional units. And those revolutionary guard soldiers came from all social classes. But that was 30 years ago now right after the revolution. I’m sure some of the revolutionary fever has subsided."
"75-100 people were trampled to death at Stalin's funeral, there's a fair chance it happened as reported."
"Outside of people running, how do so many people get trampled? Especially with a funeral. It’s not like a fast paced thing, people are walking."
"<a href=""http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1954-2/succession-to-stalin/succession-to-stalin-texts/mourners-crushed-at-stalins-funeral/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a fantastically written first person account"
Thanks!
"Also the account is horrifying, and you are right it is easier then I thought to get crushed and trampled in a funeral."
"It's a complete win, and there is no other way to put it."
"Iran basically threw a few rocks at us, and made sure to not actually hit us.  Based on what Trump is saying now, theres no other escalation either. "
So we took out one of the world's worst terrorists and all it cost us was a few poc-marcks on a couple of bases. 
That's as clear a win as you will ever get.
Journalist Yashar Ali:
"“I can’t believe I’m seeing people saying that this was a face saving move by Iran and now that there haven’t been any US casualties, that we should move on. The level of naivety is astonishing. Do people really think this is how Iran is going to retaliate?” Ali concluded."
“The problem is so many people have thought about this situation through the lens of conventional warfare. So they believe if there is no conventional warfare that the situation has deescalated. But conventional warfare should have never been the concern!”
"I am actually not a supporter but thought I'd visit this sub and chime in that this was probably more calculated then most media or leftists gave credit it too. This might be one of the most strategical victories for Trump in his entire term, but it was a huge gamble, but it turned out(so far) pretty damn good. Not only that, he distracted from his impeachment on the domestic front, so its huge win-win for him. "
"Sometimes you got to give credit where credit is due, just don't try to steal the election or make fun of dead patriots, thanks"
"The rockets Iran used were obsolete(google them yourselves). They prodded the American Bison for far too long, they then grab the tail and are surprised when they’re kicked in the teeth? They then send bottle rockets over the gate, hoping the bison charges through and destroys all units path? Will America take the bait? Or realize that we eliminated one of their most “revered leader” and their retort was to throw bang snaps at American troops(0 casualties). They then have the audacity to say that if “America doesn’t retaliate, we won’t attack again.” Retaliate to what? This inept showcasing of their “military might” was a victory for America."
"The president just gave a press conference essentially saying he’s willing to negotiate with them, so let’s see where that goes."
Don't kid yourselves....the <em>actual</em> response is in the works.
My guess at the unfolding of events....
"You had me until step 2. There’s not going to be a war. We have drones and missiles, and our cyber warfare capabilities are at a bare minimum equal to Iran’s. After they pull off their attack, well blow some shit up and break a few things then they’ll slink back into the corner and lick their wounds, just like after every other attack they tried. The Iranian government isn’t stupid, they know we’d wipe the floor with them, they don’t want that and we don’t want to waste lives when robots and drones work well enough."
"I think <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/17/welsh-f22-flew-to-drones-rescue-off-iran-coast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> perfectly illustrates the playing field."
What an awesome link and story. This post deserves more love. Thank you
"Just like Kim Jong-Un, the Iranian regime is most concerned about staying in power.  They are not going to do something that would more than likely result in them being eliminated.  They had to give some sort of response otherwise they would appear even more weak and embolden opposition at home.  But they couldn’t retaliate with more than just a token show of force lest they risk getting wiped out by the reciprocal response."
I expect some suicide bombers. Its what Iran is good at.
Direct warfare was never the name of the game for Iran and they're about to double down on their preferred asymmetrical warfare. Those who think the missiles are the end to Iran's response are naive. I predict the actual damage is going to be the result of proxy attacks on US allies (similar to the recent taking of oil tankers in Hormuz and the drone attack on the Saudi refinery) and cyber shenanigans against US companies/infrastructure.
"I view the assassination of Suleimani as a strategic mistake for the US, here's my thinking:
It's likely to contribute to Hardliners regaining power in Iran. Diplomatic efforts with Iran and it's allies will become near impossible for awhile, limiting the US's toolbox against Iranian influence. There is a real chance that Iraq will formally ask US forces to leave which will be a huge setback for force projection in the region, as access to Iraqi airspace is vital for US operations."
"Suleimani will be replaced with a new commander that will take orders from Khomeini and execute them just like him. Iran gains a martyr, which in the right hands can be a dangerous asset."
"Disagree. Been with trump on things lately, would have really loved to see a response. This makes him and the country look weak."
But I was told that Trump wanted to start WWIII?!?!?
It's almost like he doesn't listen to the 15 year olds on Reddit.

"""But IS IT?"" - CNN"
One of my liberal friends just told me the presser was bullshit and Trump said nothing of substance.
​
He literally said the situation de-escalating and that he is ready to come to the table for the betterment of the Iranian people.
"When you look at everything thru the lens of ""Orange man bad"", you only see Orange man doing bad things."
Why do you have liberal friends?
"I reaaaaaaally don’t like trump. And i lean pretty hard to the left. I watched the speech live and i have to give credit where it is due. It was a good speech. He was calm and collective, but confidant. And everything that he said (mainly the no deaths part) was great news. And i really hope the part about “iran standing down” was true. "
"I just fear that he said that from the assumption that iran purposely went soft on their attack to avoid a high body count. Because i haven’t been able to see anything about iran stamding down except for when it came from trump. So whether or not they did soften the blow on purpose, i kind of feel like it will make them angry that trump told that to the U.S. "
"Before he announced that there were no casualties, i did read a news article predicting that there would be low casualties, even though some general or something from iran said that the attack was successful and would have many deaths, so that does make me feel better. It was saying that iran knows what they are doing, and based on how their attack was delivered, they didn’t plan on killing many people. They just wanted to show that they aren’t messing around, and swing their dick a little bit. So that makes me feel better. Up until this morning i was worried about a war, but after hearing that there were no casualties and that it may have been planned that way, it strengthened my hope that iran isn’t as crazy as i thought, and they don’t think that they can win a war against the U.S. and it gives me a LITTLE but more comfort that maybe iran wont do a hardcore retaliation now and start a war. "
"i got pretty off topic. When i started this reply, my intention was to tell you that you need  to let your liberal friend know that a fellow liberal from the internet who is totally not made up, wants him to know that he should stop being a twat and let himself admit that this was a good speech from the president. But dont hate him for it if he doesn’t admit that it was at least a DECENT speech. It is really hard for people that lean far to either side to admit to themselves that the other side has done anything well. And if you cant admit it to yourself, you wont be able to admit it to anyone. I try to take a step back and look at stuff from an unbiased perspective, but i know that i have gone on long stretches where i don’t. And i probably will have stretches where i cant see outside of my bubble in the future as well. Its just really hard not to have confirmation biases, its literally just how peoples minds work. Thank you psych professor from 2009. "
"I Seriously despise trump so much that if i am going to listen to a speech, in order to have an unbiased opinion, i literally need to prepare myself beforehand. I am just chuckling to myself thinking about conservatives having to do the same thing when they were trying to sit through a speech from obama lol. "
"Politics are so funny when you really think about it. Like i wonder who the most neutral person in the world is. And i dont mean like an infant, im talking about a grown adult that is educated in politics. But i really wonder  who’s the guy that is as close to the center as possible. I wonder what that person looks like. I bet he’s a pretty cool dude and when people ask him where he stands politically, and he says he is neither left nor right, people think he is either full of shit, or uneducated. Um Shit. Im high. Also i just realized that i said he was a guy, obviously could be a girl as well. But instead of just fixing what i said, i am writing something that is taking even more of my time. Shit, now it looks like I’m a snowflake liberal that is worried about being politically correct. Shit. Yep. High. Bye."
"Also.... i was replying to this comment after clicking on the “news” section of reddit, and figured that i was speaking on a subreddit called “politics” or something like that. "
"Nope. Its just a subreddit called  “conservative”  lol. So if this comment even gets noticed, i am ready for some pretty heavy missiles headed my way. (Pun intended)"
"But i do hope if i get some replies, that they are really good ones that really make me think. "
"I am definitely having an “out of the bubble” kind of day, so if you guys have anything good to throw at me, its probably a good time because i am in a pretty receptive state right now.

"so if you guys have anything good to throw at me, its probably a good time because i am in a pretty receptive state right now."

Idk, maybe by the end of the night if i have nothing going on, i could check out ONE specific video of his. Since all i have ever seen of him is montages of how batshit crazy he is, i have never actually watched a real full video of him. If i watch ONE ☝🏼 video of him, is there a specific video you would actually want me to try and sit through? Bill clinton is a rapist? Is that one of his videos?"
I'm mostly being silly with that reply.

"Yeah, i try to every day. Of course i do watch the news to keep up with whats going on in the world. But i try to hear the key facts and ignore the way that it is presented. I have tried to question everything in my life ever since i was 16 and started asking questions about the odd religion i was raised in. And when i asked the difficult questions, i was scolded. So i started doing research on my own, realizing that i was only that religion because i was born into it, and told it was the truth. It was around then that i realized that people are easily convinced of things if they want them to be true. So i try to take a step back every once in a while and think about what is going on from different perspectives. You seem like a pretty intelligent person. So i always just find it interesting that two intelligent people can end up on different sides of the spectrum. I know that where you grow up and experiences that you have through your life have a major roll in your views. For instance, people that have many medical problems immediately have a +1 for a more socialist political view due to healthcare prices, but they could also be avid concealed carry gun owners that give them a +1 towards the right side. When it comes down to it, there is no right and wrong for everyone. Everyone needs or prefers different things in their life. Of course their are things in MY opinion that are clearly right and wrong period, that a typical conservative would disagree with. So i guess thats more when people are following good or bad sources of info. But idk man. Its a crazy world."
Most people don't base their opinions on core principles. I believe and agree with many things that don't match my gut feel because feelings are easy to manipulate. 
"Take the healthcare example. Prices for the majority of America skyrocketed with shallower coverage after the ACA. Sure, the very poorest don't have to pay but I was forced to pay several times what I used to pay and I got no benefit from it. Most people's rates went way up and that followed a leftist policy. In reality the prices for the same quality care aren't lower in countries with socialized healthcare either."
"I am definitely having an “out of the bubble” kind of day, so if you guys have anything good to throw at me, its probably a good time because i am in a pretty receptive state right now. And i will be for at LEAST another hour or so. But im planning on it being for an extended period of time, but, you know... brains."
"Let's see, mmm."
"2A is necesary to keep a dictatorial state at bay, like it happened in Venezuela 2012 when the population was forcefully disarmed and now the army goes around murdering civilians."
"Scanvinavia is not social democracy, or democratic socialism, nor any form of socialism, it uses a system called social liberalism, which is a branch of classical liberalism with more than a 100 years old, which propones a state that creates a social safety net in a free market environment."
"Democrats in the USA have adopted latin american cultural marxist tactics and they are implementing them , which can be resumen to heavy use of identity politics and the constant destruction of all the mechanisms that keepts them from holding absolute power ( the 2a , electoral college, freedom of speech etc )."
​
I guess that's all that comes to me right now.
"This is what I dont get, whenever obama took out a terrorist there was no outrage from conservatives. "
If Obama took the same actions as Trump over the past week he'd be recieving praise from the right.
"When Osama Bin Laden was killed, there was<a href=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/2/osama-bin-ladens-death-sparks-celebration-dc/""> LITERALLY celebrations in the streets</a> of the US. "
Now we have talking heads on CNN hand wringing over this one. Orange Man Bad rules them all.
I was in the states at the time and immediately went to bar with  buddies to celebrate.
You monster! Why do you hate brown people???
"The difference is that Bin laden was one of the co founders to Al qaeda wich did absolutly nothing good than bringing terror everywere they went, they have killed millions of people. "
"Soleimeni was a iranian general who became a national hero during iraq-iran war. He helped USA in afghanistan to capture Al-qaeda members. He has made ceasefires with different groups and even made the kurdish and Iraqi army fight IS together on serveal offensives.
His military career have a long list, it's worth a google! 
But he is not innocent, he have made serveral crimes against humanity during all of the wars but you can't really compare him to Bin laden, who was just being an asshole and was the mastermind behind 9/11."
Thats why noone is celebrating.
"You realize that Bin Laden helped fight the Soviets in Afghanistan with our backing, right? 
But keep pushing your stupid agenda that whatever the Dems do is great."
Get outta here with this Iranian propaganda.
It's obvious that there is a consequential difference between killing a stateless terrorist and a high ranking military leader of another country (even if they materially act the same way).
There is a very real possibility there will be war after killing another country's General.
"If he was in Iran, sure. But he wasn't. He was in Iraq planning an assault on our embassy. He's fair game at that point."
"Not arguing on whether the guy was bad news, he was a formally sanctioned butcher. I AM arguing there is a stark difference in terms of geopolitical norms and potential consequences to killing someone with a formal military position rather than a nonstate combatant. This gambit could still cause us to get sucked into another war regardless of the deescalation today. I doubt this is the end."
I doubt that the people he killed care about the nuance of his title.
People are celebrating.  In Iran.  That just doesnt make the news.
Hed be receiving almost universal praise and would be rightfully basking in it.
Trump got to appease his hard liners by taking out a Iranian general in response to them killing an American contractor. He also gets to appease to independents by showing he can de-escalate the situation and isnt going to cause ww3. This will help his re-election chances.
"I'm not a hardcore trump guy by any stretch, but he could not of handled this situation any better"
Whole-heartedly agree
"I have <em>so</em> many problems with the man, but his speech today hit on so many overdue foreign-policy buttons, I'll be voting for him this year."
"He told NATO to stop twiddling their thumbs and <em>do something.</em>  He told the Saudis and Iranians we don't need their oil.  That bit at the end was a subtle encouragement to the Iranian people to defy their government, something Obama completely ignored."
"He also goaded the left into defending a mass murderer and exporter of international terrorism while exposing their insane, light-their-hair-on-fire fear mongering."
The media has spent 4 years tossing all their remaining credibility (of which there was not much) into the garbage.  The people can see it now.
The art of the deal: trade the biggest terrorist on America's list for some blown up sand.
And sell the glass back to them.
With sanctions on said glass.
Yuge!
A US contractor was killed December of last year.

"And most of all, no war. I think I'm fully on the Trump train now."
Thank <strong>God</strong> both sides appear to be standing down. Save your face/egos and resolve the matter without violence.

"i am thrilled with the outcome we appear to be getting here.  we got rid of a terrorist in a suit, and lost nothing."
I'm still waiting and seeing before being thrilled. We might have just created 100 more terrorists at the cost of removing one.
"Ok what would you have done ? Because until now Obama's strategy of giving those  bastards money and doing nothing hasn't worked, and they have bombed half the planet already ( this is hyperbole )."
"I would've wiped out some more militia to provoke an all out war so we can undeniably force a treaty. But still, now I'm waiting and seeing if this soft approach is worth anything."
"trump just can't do anything good, can he?"
"I mean it is the middle east. Obama pulling out troops created ISIS, all our actions their had consequences later. We use to fund Bin Laden in his fight vs the Soviets ffs. The place is cursed."
"Trump did right, we want the larger war because we are better equipped and can easily outmatch them. It's the Iranians that are ""backing out"" so to say so they can continue harassing our military might in the middle East if their response is indicative of the bigger picture."
we want the larger war 
"um, except we don't.  the president said in his address this morning that we want peace with iran.  the majority of folks on this sub (myself included) were stoked that things appear to be deescalating."
nobody.  wants.  war.
"Listen, all I'm saying is if the Iranians want it so badly we should return the favor. If you're not willing to defend your country and it's army who are working so hard so that you can live in harmony, you might as well not have one."
"Soleimani created, funded, directed etc. many thousand terrorists. It was literally his job."
"Dems can't make up their minds. On one hand, they fear WW3. On the other, that's actually what they want"
"Well, when you hate America, it's a win/win."
"I'm not surprised at all by this.  Especially after it was announced there weren't any American casualties.  Despite what the general public keep screeching about, Trump is NOT a war hawk, does not want another war, and wants peace.  He knows that with these people you cannot show weakness in order to obtain peace.  He was one of the very few public figures to be against the Iraq War from the beginning and yet since it doesn't fit the left's narrative on the old war-hawk NeoCons, they ignore it."
"Over several months, Iran has lobbed rockets at Iraqi bases housing US troops. That was at best maintaining a status quo of harassment."
"They seized tankers in Hormuz, in an escalatioon move."
"They shot down one (two?) US drones in an escalation move. Trump responded in a roughly proportional way, doing some property damage to them, choosing not to escalate by killing people."
Last month Iran escalated by killing a US citizen in a rocket strike.
Shortly after they escalated again by fomenting a siege and breach of the US embassy.
"Trump responded with a severe escalation - he took out Soleimani in a surprise strike, as well as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah who conducted the attack that killed the US citizen and some other Iran proxy terrorists."
"Iran's next move, has turned out to be a de-escalation - they lobbed missiles at unoccupied parts of two bases after informing Iraq of the specifics of their action in advance."
"We're probably back to status quo. But the pattern here was Iranian escalation, Trump's measured responses up to the point he would no longer tolerate it (loss of life and breach of an embassy), followed by Iran backing off."
"Yes, Trump finally put some hard lines back in place.  America should be moving to get itself out of this Middle East quagmire, but projecting strength is still important in the mean time."
"The Democrat party is FUMING over this victory for Trump. <a href=""/r/worldnews"">/r/worldnews</a> is in shambles. These people truly cannot take Trump and this administration winning. This was the best strategy yet from the Trump team. Iran stupidly, erroneously, ignorantly attacks a US embassy. America retaliates with furious vengeance and eliminates one of Irans most “revered leaders.” Iran’s vows “GREAT REVENGE” and a 3 day mourning of their “austere religious scholar.” In that time, 60 are trampled at a funeral procession where most were forced to attend. LEST WE FORGET? JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IRAN WAS ELIMINATING PROTESTERS TO THE REGIME IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. Now the best part, Iran’s “revenge.” They lob 15 obsolete rockets at 2 airbases, 4 fail, and 0 American casualties are reported.  It gets better folks. After this “show of might” Iran, like the petulant child of a country they are, “OK if America doesn’t retaliate to this, we’ll stop attacking.” Iran was trying to prod the beast <em>AGAIN</em>. Who didn’t take this bait? Donald Trump. There’s a big difference between baits and American intelligence. You’ve got filet mignon and the American embassy, then you got 0 casualties and the impossible whopper. It still keeps getting better folks.  Trump then comes out as cool hand luke and infuriates the democrat party with a somber and well spoken message. This is an ultimate win for the Republican Party in this country. We eliminated a terrorist responsible for the murder of countless American troops, and when threatened with a retaliatory attack from the aggressor, we came out unscathed, and actually offered an open hand to initiate peace talks. Perfectly planned and executed, I’m proud of this administrations moves on a very serious subject."
Not to mention it looks like Iran shot down a passenger airline in a whoopsies type event.
I read that was mechanical failure. Your comment is first I've heard of anything being shot down. Got a source?
"Obviously nothing's been proven yet, and that's why I said it looks like iran shot down this airliner. 
There are sources speculating this, but you can duckduckgo them for yourself. "
The theory goes like this. 
"The type of plane being flown was extremely reliable. Engine failures do not effect coms, yet there was no mayday. The pictures show what look like shrapnel. Iran is refusing to hand over the black box. "
"The likely explanation is Iran's air defense went on high alert, got jumpy and made a boo boo. "
"Conspiracy theorists are claiming Iran got wind of a potential Soleimani coup, set him up to allow the trump admin to get a win while taking out a threat against the supreme leader and the plane had pro Soleimani people in it. This is why the Iranians warned the US of the retaliatory strikes. It gives everyone a wi , except for you know, Soleimani, without further escalation no one really wants."
"""Mechanical Failure"" which is why Iran won't turn over the recovered black boxes."
"This is pretty standard. They'll review the box and then turn it over, ideally."
"Can you source the fuming? I'm just seeing people relieved we didn't go to war in <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/politics</a> and <a href=""/r/worldnews"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/worldnews</a>."
"Trump said: ""The U.S. is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it."""
There's a quote you won't see on CNN.
I imagine when the Islamic republic finally falls they’ll reformat as a real democracy.  Iranian people seem to largely want that. If the British didn’t give us bad intel and get us to oust Mossadegh by saying he was a communist so we would save their oil companies they might already have one.
Today on the left: disappointment that Iran wasn't able to kill any of our troops
I’m glad it seems there is a stand down however  Playjng devil’s advocate This is not the end of Iran’s retaliation ISoleimani was a huge piece of their puzzle I find it very hard to believe they would just do a little firework show and call it at that.  I think the real attack via their terrorist groups will still come. They are just waiting possibly for Trump to get beaten in the elections. We all know none of the Democrat candidates have a spine
"They've been funnelling money to terrorist groups regardless for decades... they are the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. You're worried that they might do more now that we've killed their top brass??? How much more aggression would you be willing to forgive, Neville?? They got spanked and they know it."
Well handled Don.
"apparently the U.S forces inside that base were called and warned an hour before the attack by Iran lol. ""Just lets us launch some missles and  our punches so we dont look like little bitches"" -Iran."
This is a huge win for trump. He also exposed the america hating left for what they truly are...insane.
[deleted]
Lol get real dude. We killed their top general and they blew up some Iraqi sand. It wasn’t even our base and there weren’t any casualties.
Do you guys think that this is Trump's Red line?
I think it is Trump listening to logic instead of emotions. I think it is Trump tuning out the military industrial complex. I think it is Trump saving countless lives in Iran and of U.S. service members.
How was it different from what Obama did?
Edit: i dont want a war. BUT if you say you will do something you have to do it
The one and only thing I give Obama credit for was the assassination of Bin Laden. I give credit where credit is due and that took some major fortitude.
This isn't the Obama stand down in Syria. This was the U.S. flexing and Iran finding out that Trump wasn't a normal U.S. politician. Then Iran had to save face because it is important to their culture. So they launched attacks avoiding people. 
Obama gave that redline and continued to let others cross it. Which emboldened them. Trump punched back and rattled Iran. Then walked back rhetoric when he found out that Iran was rattled. I think we were really close to war. Really close.
We will have to go to war with Iran one day. Its better if its before they get nuke
"Well, for starters, we aren't sending them billions in cash..."
"I don't think so. No casualties, but additional sanctions, plus apparent endorsement of the Ryan Doctrine from Tom Clancy novels (direct targeting of leadership elements as a deterrent)."
Noted the Ryan Doctrine thing too. 
"Theres a spooky similarity to the Ryan timeline and ours. 9/11, trade wars with the FARC east and a nonpolitician business savvy president."
No.
[deleted]
No casualties. Just peacocking. No reason to retaliate.
"They missed everyone on purpose. In their claim for the bombings, they said they weren't looking for war. The release was a message that they weren't meaning any harm by them. Material can easily be replaced."
No man. We didn’t lose anyone. Further escalation could cost the lives of our brothers and sisters. 
"We can sanction them economically and isolate them. It’s more efficient, and costs us less money and blood."
"We killed their most important general and they launched an ""attack"" that happened to ""miss"" everything. Our message was clear. They're done. No point in pouring gas on the embers at this point."
They gave iraq a heads up so everyone could go inside and be safe. Iraq obviously told us. 
Them shooting missiles into the dirt isn't worth starting a war over. Just let them have their propaganda.
"This IS a retaliation.  A proportional one, as per UN REGULATIONS.  And now the situation is likely diffused for now.  Stop bucking for non stop tit for tat."
I would be so happy if he managed to get them to agree to that.
If only for a week.  It would be ever so beautiful
I just spit out my ice water...lmao

"It was. The comment by the 419th Fighter Wings was implied to be directed at Iran. It's very similar to our Naval training exercises in the Pacific with Japan. While these are planned training missions, it is still a worldwide message of strength."
Especially with gathering 52 F-35A's in one spot and flying them together. That's not a regular training mission. That's a display of force.
"Exactly, read my comment and it will all make sense."
"I might be a bit ready for a fight, it seems lol. I getcha."
I'm retired from the belgian army for about 12 years now. But hell yeah. If we could free some nations from those feudal regimes like they have in Iran I would be game. I was a grunt btw not a pilot. (Edit android translated iran into israel)

"""Elizabeth Warren struggles to answer"""
"I've yet to see this woman give a direct answer to any substantive (even basic) question(s). Sure, it's what politicians do, but she takes it to the next level. It's infuriating. Even Chris Mathews and Stephen Colbert called her out on it, which says alot."
Quick PR team into my earpiece tell me if it’s cool to defend terrorists
But she just wants to have a beer with us and be the Cool Mom.
“I’m gonna get me a beer.”
It says a lot that this should have been an easy answer and it took multiple attempts before she begrudgingly admitted the fact he was a terrorist.
When did they call her out on it?
"In the 2020 debates a host asked Warren what she thought of leading economics professors saying her high taxes would slow economic growth. She responds""well that's just wrong"" no explanation, nothing else to back her stupid position up."
Google these phrases:
"""Elizabeth Warren Colbert report"""
"""Elizabeth Warren Chris Mathews"""
Not difficult to find the videos in question as they are among the first search results.
I bet she has a plan to rid the world of terrorists by not announcing that anyone is a terrorist. Being born a terrorists is a right just like free education and healthcare an no one should be denied their right to live without being labeled.
I read that last sentence in her voice. It's scary how easy it was to imagine her saying that.
But also free abortions for all with no restrictions.

Q: ""okay we get it, total costs will go down, so healthcare costs will go down, but in exchange... taxes go up, right?""<br/>
A: ""total costs will go down"""
"The amount of times that happened and how she just flat out refused to answer any question from anybody (even during the public debates) with anything except ""total costs will go down"" regardless of how they asked it, I just don't know what to say.  It was really cringey when the entire world is sitting there looking at her dodging this question so much that they have no choice but to move on and pretend like that didn't just happen."
Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working
Imagine still thinking this when Iran is essentially telling the members of that deal to fuck off now. She is using extremely outdated talking points
"She is pathetic, no convictions whatsoever"
"She should have just said, ""I have not had sexual relations with that woman!"". It would have been a more acceptable answer."
"This inability of the Left to acknowledge that taking out Soleimani was a justified response to him being the mastermind behind numerous attacks that have led to American deaths while at the same time being on the side of Iran against the US is absolutely infuriating.  Their hatred for Trump (and by extension all of us that are not on the Left) is so severe that they actually side with our enemies.  If that isn’t treasonous thinking, I don’t know what is."
fuck all the stuff he did recently. The guy's sole job was actively sponsoring foreign wars for decades and purposefully creating unrest that's led to thousands of deaths directly and indirectly. He's been on a list for a long time
"What hell is wrong with these people? They do realize they can acknowledge the guy was a piece of shit while also questioning the strategy of bombing him, right?"
"well that'd be what us normal, rational folk would do. It'd be easier for me to rationalize the behavior of people like Warren and Zuckerberg if I found out they were aliens or fucking lizard people instead of actual human beings."

"Hey, don't bash on Warren too much... she struggled to call him a terrorist because she was spending so much time thinking about how she was going to half the Veteran suicide deaths AFTER she was elected President... that is a lot of pressure on one person to think about. :P"

"She's getting to be as mind numbing as Robert Francis. Jesus, that's a high bar but she's almost there."
Guys I don’t understand. 
The media and Democrats assured me Trump was a warmongering child who wanted to start war with Iran to get re-elected. 
Why would someone who wants war respond to Iran’s missile attack with sanctions instead of taking their golden opportunity to bomb the shit out of them?
"Surely they’d never lie, so this must be more of that 4D chess I’m always hearing about."
"According to the left, we’ve all died about 27 times now and it’s all Trump’s fault."
"Didja, sorry, I'm laughing while typing, see where nanc ignored the call last night from Pence?"
"They said the same type of warmongering things about Reagan.  Reagan did this sort of thing more than once, and it works.  I am completely open to a separate discussion about why we are in some of these countries, and all of that.  As long as we are there though, sending a clear message there are repercussions for directly harming US interests is necessary."
Trump prevented escalating conflict with Iran with ONE show of force. #Trump2020
Yep.
I like a President with cojones...major cojones.
"Major Cojones, reporting for duty, sir!"
"I'm still at work...so, I'm trying to follow along.  Has CNN or MSNBC....or Pelosi and Schumer come out and said Trump was weak and cowardly for <em>not</em> retaliating against Iran's missile attacks?  It's coming....I don't want to miss it."
"You are right. Have no fear, this sub will have it posted promptly when it happens."
This sub yesterday will talking about Iran being destroyed. I love how it flops with what ever Trump says.
Trump shoot rockets into the ground in Syria it is a great show of force. Iran does the same and it isnt anything. 
"If Iran shoots at us they will have 52 places crushed. Nope, nothing happens."
Well I'm banned. Banning retired Marines is really Conservative guys.
Edit 2. Looks like new rocket attacks in Baghdad. Yep Iran gave up guys and Trump won LOL. Let's see him ramble nonsense more and show he isnt willing to really do anything.
"Yeah, the same can be said for the same side.  Yesterday, folks like you were screaming that Trump was trying to get us into World War III, and how many people would have to die because he killed a beloved Iranian General."
"Today, since there's not going to be a war, you're taunting the President for not hitting back after he said he would if they tried to attack us. "
"I mean, in the end, it's kind of sad."
"You know being a retired marine doesn't automatically make your beliefs conservative, right? I'm asking because I saw you use this line in another thread."
"Lol at your comment about banning retired marines. You literally sit around a comment non-conservative takes on a self proclaimed conservative sub. You’re a troll that’s obsessed w trying to upset the members of the sub. If you get banned it has nothing to do with what your past occupation was, and I’m sure everyone respects for it. Just bc you were in the military doesn’t mean we should have to repeatedly take bullshit from you lmao."
I am impressed with President Trump's remarks here and how he handled this situation.
Stand down...no casualties.  
Awesome.
"Thank you for doing this.  I wish I could give you the coldest Busch Light in the world, but I can not.  Have an upvote."
"As soon as he was 13 minutes late and heard Iran said they weren’t doing anything more, I knew we weren’t escalating anything. Sorry, lefties, no WWIII today."

I’m sure that he downloaded something questionable and there was an embedded file that showed his IP address and he got scared. But the admission of it being CP is very scary.
A few things about this:
"If he's a CP collector, this is going to be a huge blow to the NYT times."
Also even if a hacker went used his IP address the FBI stain would be on their computer which has the MAC address of the hackers laptop not Paul’s.
There's a possibility that he just doesn't understand computers and relayed the info from tech support incorrectly. But if he repeated it verbatim it sounds like he was victim to one of those PC support telemarketers LOL

How do liberals support this?
With Tlaib no less.  Evil has truly penetrated Washington.
"Did you watch the video? Sure, she's being irreverent chatting with colleagues in the background while Rep. Lee is speaking, but what part of this is ""evil""? She's barely even paying attention to what's being said."
I don't thinks it's evil so much as dismissive. They're discussing a serious topic on camera. The least she can do is pretend to care.
You realize if that was Trump it would be on every news channel.
"Why are they allowed to be elected officials? Why would they even want to be, considering how much they hate America? Fucking disgusting"
"Why is this POS still in Congress?  Same goes for her bud there.  They obviously hate this country, so why stay?  Oh, wait...change it from within with the help of other America-haters in the Democratic Party (and there are MANY).  Plus, where else in the world could they go and get elected and PAID to spout hate about their adopted country?"
Looked like a scene out of Star Wars
"Wasn't she the one that said something about ""dual loyalty"" or something like that? Well it's clear that she has no loyalty to the US as one may have thought previously."
Proving at a most inopportune time that she does not mind flaunting disrespect to her colleagues as well as the American people. What a complete POS.
What you mean that doing nothing but apologizing to people for who you are and handing them wads of cash so that they hopefully one day will like you isn't an effective foreign policy strategy?
Remember when Obama bombed a hospital
Remember when we disclosed civilian drone casualties instead of hiding them?
Typical liberal douche.  They have the right answers for everyone...but you can be sure this isn't the right answer for him and his family.  If you vote for these tools you are telling them that you are fine being treated by them as the infantile idiot that you are.

There's one a comment or two below that list.
There's five of them.
That’s actually pretty lame compared to all the vitriol spewed by media and others since 2015.

"I could see it happening, their air defenses has to be on the highest of alerts. All those guys must be terrified the next bomb is coming for them."
Scared guys equal itchy trigger fingers
There’s no benefit to them shooting down a plane in the current environment and especially a plane with no Americans and tons of Iranian born members of other nations aboard.  What likely happened is as the other poster said they were on high alert and the military confused the flight with a US bomber.  It crashed very close to an Iranian military base and the plane had just had maintenance work done recently so it’s unlikely to have been a malfunction.  Their unwillingness to turn over the black box virtually confirms it was shot down.
All the more reason not to let them have nukes.
RIP Sweet Prince...
Could Trump please go ahead and declare his love for oxygen and end this sh-t show?

Let's go face-first into a war that's avoid-a-ble-ah!
I think we are done bootlicking our enemies. Feel free to reminisce about the good old Obama years when we kissed their asses.
"This time, I believe the conflict will escalate a bit, not deescalate.  As OP stated, they've hated us since the 70s, actually they've hated us since we fucked with their system in the 50s, we did have a concern the anti-Western leadership would mess our relationship up, but not to the point where they would kill US troops- or at least I don't think so."
Theyve already been escalating before trump. We literally just finally did something
This is what I don't get...
The dissenting opinion on this thread seem to be operating on the premise that Trump is the aggressor here.
"Maybe it's because Trump lured an Iranian Statesman into another country under the premise of diplomatic negotiations and then killed him. And then threatened to commit war crimes. Twice. Not to mention that the whole situation only arised, because he cancelled the nuclear deal for the reason being that it was Obama's deal, not his."
"And the way he handled the situation with North Korea, showed everyone in the world, that you need nuclear weapons to make him listen to you."
Interested to know where you got that information.  No where has it been portrayed that General Solemeni a know terrorist leader and killer for 20+ years was in Baghdad for talks with the US.  I’ll agree with the tweets about culture sites - such as they are.  War crimes though?  That’s too far.
"It's not too far, it's literally in the definition."
"I have never mentioned that he was there for talks with the US. He was there for talks with Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the US pushed the Iraqi leaders to invite him as a mediator, so that they could kill him."
And destroying cultural sites is a war crime by the definition of the Geneva Convention. Not that the US would give a fuck about that
"You said ""Trump lured an Iranian Statesman into another country..."" - if he wasn't there for talks with us, Trump had nothing to do with it. "
We haven't destroyed any cultural sites.  Doing so is a war crime.  Threatening to do so is not.
The US Administration said to the Iraqi Administration that Soleimani had to partake onto the negotiations with Saudi Arabia. How does this not involve Trumps plan to assassinate him? These are methods from the middle ages
And I have never written that Trump committed war crimes (show me the citation) you are just deliberately trying to turn my words against me.
"I don't know where you're getting this nonsense from. If we weren't participating in the negotiations, why would we tell the Iraqis who they had to have in their negotiations?  Soleimani was there to meet with Iraqi leadership, and it was not at the behest of the United States.  Soleimani wasn't in hiding - we've known where he was for years.  "
"""And destroying cultural sites is a war crime by the definition of the Geneva Convention. Not that the US would give a fuck about that"""
"We haven't destroyed any cultural sites, and we're not going to. It was a threat, nothing more."
"The citation does not state, that the US destroyed cultural sides. It just states, that destroying cultural sides is a war crime and the US demonstrably does not care about war crimes. Nothing about Trump committing war crimes."
"And the Iraqi leadership said, that it was on the behest of the US. And the US didn't even deny it. Sorry, but I and most of the rest of the world is already at a state, where we trust the Iraqi Leadership more than the notoriously lying US Government."
My theory is that he acts like a madman in public to scare the enemy so that they'll actually listen to him
In public... we've been fucking with them for years using covert tactics and strategy. Dumbest thing I've seen from this cabinet.
"They've attacked us 3 or 4 times now, Trump ignored all of them until they killed a US citizen. They are the ones that have started it."
"So you're not a fan of history?  We've been at each other's throats since we toppled and replaced thier government (with extremists). Its not surprising that they attacked/killed a US citizen.  So when you say that they ""started it"" its overlooking aspects of our foreign policy that we as Americans tend to overlook. Personally, I don't want another quagmire in the middle east."
We're talking about Trump and what's happened since he took office. Yes Iran has been trouble for decades but we are talking about the current conflict.
"Which stems from decades of trouble between both nations. The world does not live in a bubble and often past actions remain as a motivator for future generations (9/11). Its unfortunate and disheartening but that the way it is. War is inevitable. If were going to have another war in the middle east, we need concrete evidence. From my understanding the evidence provided by Pompeo is flimsy at best and if we're going to send young Americans to another conflict it better be something worth sacrificing for. Unlike 99% of America I've spent time in Afghanistan. I just want to prevent someone from losing their child in a needless conflict. So when you say your talking about the current conflict please understand that it's not contained to a four year term."
"I also know many people from Iran that fled when the Ayatollah took over and their families were part of the previous government, marked for death so they came here and resettled. I've heard a great deal about it from them. One of my co-workers is married into their family."
"The thing they explained to us, about their culture is that they do not respect weak maneuvers like negotiating, or capitulation by other countries, they do however respect if you stand up to them. That's what we're finally doing and may actually cause de-escalation of tensions over other methods. All of them agree that we were right to take out the terrorist general though."
"For your friends, It's good that they found peace in America and were able to rebuild their life. May god bless them. "
"As for Iranian society I also would agree with you that Iran and some nations tend to respond to machismo tactics over passive politcol options such as negotiating. However, making a hugh spectacul by drone bombing a general is something that could of been handled differently. "
"I'm not saying the Iranian general did not deserve to die, far from it. He's committed or overseen operations that have directly affected our nations security. The reason why I dislike this action so much is that it paints a big target on our back, at home and around the world. This was just a big show that could of been openly denied. Now the whole world is worrying about WWIII. "
As for de-escalation they attacked a military base housing US troops in Iraq within the last 24 hours. And from the reports they do not feel satisfied with results and may attack other targets.
They should quit while they're ahead. If they kill US soldiers we are more likely to take out the rest of their military
"Methinks you aren't capable of following events too closely. For each act of aggression Iran made against us from 2014-2016, I'll list you give that they've made since Trump was elected. "
This will be fun! OK... GO!!!
More like 1951 when the CIA and MI6 orchestrated a Coup in Iran
Or the support of iraq and its use of chemical weapons in a decade long war that interestingly started one year after they kicked out the US backed dictator.
"Orchestrated a coup? There were rising tensions in Iran before the CIA and MI6 even got involved. Did the US and UK take advantage of those tensions to their in own benefit? Yes, but shit was hitting the fan with or without those two powers."
The is simply a revisionist history talking point regurgitated by leftist and radical isolationist.
Doesn’t negate the point that we installed the Shah and then protected him when the Iranian people wanted justice for abusing his people and then they overtook our embassy in 1979. It’s not leftist or radical isolationist bullshit to claim we made them hate us when gave them a brutal dictator and denied them justice
The Iranian people wanted justice?  You really think that's what caused the revolution in 1979?
"Of course there were tensions before the coup, that’s what prompts people to feel a coup necessary."
"What shit was hitting the fan? That democratically elected Mossadegh wanted to nationalize oil fields, directly interfering in our economic interests? Figures America would pick oil over democracy."
"“Revisionist history,” come on man, are you gonna really say that when we have primary source documents declassified from the CIA detailing their orchestration of the Coup? <a href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/"">https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/</a>"
"It’s absolutely not revisionist history, and you either don’t know what you’re talking about or spreading lies for some reason that I can’t really figure out, so I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just don’t know what you’re talking about."
My favorite part is when he tried to discredit the coup by describing a situation that is exactly on par when there is a coup.
Get em’
There's tensions right now in the USA. Does that make it right for Iran or Russia to orchestrate a coup?
"The world would be a better and more peaceful place had the USA never have gotten involved in the Middle East. Although, the USA would never be as powerful as it is now had it not destroyed nations for its interests."
"If you take out ""USA"" and replace it with ""British Empire"" you'd be correct."
"Exactly. Mosaddegh had promised many reforms for the people. However, when he led the nationalization effort, he didn't count on Brittains response. The sanctions and embargo were very effective, and oil revenue crashed. With no money to fund his reforms, Mosaddegh obtained special powers from parliment to attempt to push his agenda. Unfortunately it looked more and more like he was setting himself up to be dictator this friends began to desert him and his # of enemies grew."
Iran was a dumpster fire before the so called coup.
"And to add to that, does the US being involved mean they have no other option but to become a shithole theocracy? Do these racists really think that lowly of these people that they have no autonomy, no control over themselves? The people they had in charge before were not good either."
"Uh, no - sorry. 1951 is when Iran decided it would be a great idea to nationalize the Brittain built oil industry. "
Brittain pushed back with sanctions and embargoes. 
"Churchill was responsible for the coup. Eisenhower allowed Churchill to convince him that the Irani PM, Mosaddegh, was going to align Iran with the USSR. Mosaddegh had managed to anger just about everyone in Iran by 1953 when his coalition began to unravel. "
CIA was involved in a massive negative publicity campaign as part of the coup. This was in 1953.
"You’re definitely right about the dates, I was wrong on that front! "
"Otherwise, the Shah reinstated Mossadegh after he first resigned. Then, largely in part due to the CIA propaganda campaign you mention, which was part of their Coup plans, the Shah was convinced to take the CIA’s side and dismiss Mossadegh. "
"The coup didn’t go exactly as the CIA planned, but in the end was successful in propping up a pro-US, pro-Shah government until 1979 when Iranian resentment of the Shah and America led to the Iranian Revolution."
...which failed.  The Prime Minister resigned after that.
The Prime Minister resigned for what reason again?
"The first time in 1952 was because he was losing popularity and halted the parliamentary elections after the minimum number of delegates for a quorum were elected, then insisted on appointing the Minister of War and the Chief of Staff - something the Shah had done up to that point.  The Shah refused so he resigned."
"Instigated by Mosaddegh, Islamists staged massive demonstrations and called for the assassination of the Shah."
"Fearful of a mutiny, the military ordered the troops back to the barracks, at which point the Shah dismissed the new Prime Minister and re-appointed Mossaddegh.  He then convinced Parliament (which remember, he had halted elections for while it was still stacked with his supporters from the cities), to grant him emergency powers, which he then used to limit the power of the Shah, forbidding him to talk to foreign diplomats, transferring royal lands to the state, and expelling his allies."
"When his original 6 month grant of emergency powers expired, he pressured parliament into giving him another 12 months, during which he took land and power from the aristocracy, and instituted communal land reforms - which transferred land to the government and production to the poor."
"...which as such communist schemes usually do, failed miserably.  The peasants got poorer and unhappier, and his allies in the government began to turn against him."
The British managed to convince the US to get involved and a plot was hatched to convince the Shah to dismiss Mosaddegh again - which the Shah refused to do.
"Aware that parliament was against him, Mosaddegh, supported by the communist party, submitted a referendum to the voters to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister the power to make law.  Separate polling stations were set up for Yes and No votes, and the resolution passed 2,043,300 votes for to 1207 votes against.  Mosaddegh announced the results August 16, 1953.  The Shah declared the results ""fraudulent"" (as it seems they likely were).  "
"Later that day, the Shah agreed to dismiss Mosaddegh, and signed a declaration doing so, then fled the country after an attempt to overthrow Mosaddegh by the Imperial Guard was thwarted by government forces."
The CIA sent a cable to Eisenhower two days later informing him the coup had failed.
"...but a popular uprising occurred after this, and on 19 August the military joined in and defeated government forces, restoring the Shah as ruler.  The following day, Mosaddegh surrendered to the military, and was placed under arrest.  He was later tried, convicted, and spent the remainder of his life under house arrest."
"Well they should have wanted to be like us and we wouldn't have any problems. Also not be an theocracy, also not sponsor terrorism and treat their women horribly. If they just stopped being Iran we'd be friendos."
"Shia and Sunni tensions, combined with a hate for Israel, are two main driving factors behind Iran's pursuit of regional hegemony.  They also existed long, long before the 1950s.  "
"The coup leveraged the already existing tendencies of certain factions and their beliefs, and promoted them.  It didn't transform an entire country into religious, tribal zealots who hate Jews.  I can see arguments about one influence having dominate power versus another, and so on.  The problem is this stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum. 
 Iranians are largely responsible for the direction their country took, even if it wasn't universal decision or the direction they all wanted."
"We gave it a shot. We had already squared away all the rest of our World; other than a few hot spots, we're paying to keep our water ways reasonably pirate free. The US polices all of our waters. Everybody else gets to profit at no cost. When we set up the Bretton Wood Agreement, we were striving to raise the rest of us; for free, no tax, no levies, we got this. Eighty years later, why do we? So we can be insulted and expected to hold what we set, and only asked for more. Good God; you'd figure that all the other folks would, at the very least, throw us a bone. 
Nope; uneasy is the Nation that wears the Crown. Why bother bearing the biggest stick we've ever known, without weilding our advantage."
Can you source that point about the US policing all of our waters? Can't find a good answer on google
It takes alot of time to broker peace.
and split second to ruin it.
Riiiight... Iran was JUST about to stop hating us until Trump ruined it! Ha! Good one!
Do leftists actually believe stuff like this when they say it? Did you actually think this comment through? I'd hope not because for someone to type some dumb shit like this and actually believe it makes me wonder if there is any hope for said someone.
You do understand that hating another country and being at war with it can be mutually exclusive?
"I hate the Welsh, but I'm not going to drone strike Cardiff."
How could anyone hate the Welsh??
Easy. They're annoying.
What country are you living in?
"Japan. But, I'm English."
I've never met a Welsh person who wasn't annoying.
That's...really weird.
I know. It's so weird how annoying the Welsh can be. Globally.
"Although you are correct, it doesn't apply to Iran."
"They might not want to go to war, but they've shown in recent months that they are ever more increasingly willing to take military action against U.S. interests and assets in the region."
"They wanted their money back and instead of appeasement, Trump has decided to take a more deterrent strategy due to Iran's escalating aggression on the region."
I'd hope not because for someone to type some dumb shit like this and actually believe it makes me wonder if there is any hope for said someone.
Self-aware much?
"doesn't seem like you are, no"
Donald Trump don’t trust Iran they is Asshooooe
Classic...hahaha
1979 or 1978?
"Note: I did not make the meme. However, the Iranian Revolution started in January of 1978 and lasted until February of 1979. The bulk of the Iranian Revolution took place in 1978. The Iranian Revolution ended in Feb of 1979 when the Shah left in Iran in exile. 1979 is also when the theocratic-republic constitution was created and Ayatollah was named Supreme Leader in December."
That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America! Is he right? NO
"this is the problem fools, in Iran things were getting much better, progressive people were starting to get in power and slowly and surely away from reglious bullshit and eventually would be able to get rid of the people in power now. I know so many Iranians, like now what killing this guy did was put a huge end to that for a long time, it united Iranians and will cause problems 1000x the amount of people to hold grudges against America like what happened with ISIS, one thing is Iranians are smart so they won't get that easily brainwashed but this war opens the door for some gruesome shit when things were actually starting to get good in that country. This war is for no other reason but trump trying to keep power, which will backfire because so many people are against a war but overall 80% of you are Russian bots but the small percent stop being retarded and see whats actually going on, im not even liberal, I fucking hate current snowflake culture and love my guns but im being realistic a war is not something we should support PERIOD."
[removed]
There will be asymmetrical retaliation to this strike. There were far better ways to go about this that clearly were not explored. Months ago this sub was lauding Trump pulling out of Syria touting non-interventionism and now has done a complete 180 because muh warmachine.
What were the far better ways? Do elaborate...
It’s kinda understood worldwide on virtually every level that this sort of thing gets done in such a way to prevent any negative consequences to both homeland and troops abroad.
"In this case, teaming up some seals with some US-friendly local militia to go in and surgically remove the general, and being able to say that US-supported troops successfully and efficiently neutralized this target. Get bipartisan support."
"Whichever way you want to slice this, the US will absolutely face retaliation for Trump’s poorly thought out strike. Had he done this through a few degrees of separation or at very least fucking planned it so US lives wouldn’t be directly at risk, this wouldn’t be the mess it is turning into. But hey, cheer on another endless war."
"Speaking of US lives being at risk have you forgotten that just a week ago this piece of garbage orchestrated an attack on a US embassy? Why should we beat around the bush to take out the guy that attacked our embassy putting US citizens at risk? If only Trump had shipped them piles of money they’d stop burning down our embassies, attacking ships and Saudi oil facilities, shooting down our drones, murdering their own damn citizens, attacking our bases, and arming terrorist groups from Lebanon to Yemen. Time began when Trump ordered that drone strike apparently and that’s why we have this mess according to you. "
And don’t make me fucking laugh with that line about “bipartisan support.”
"You do realize I’m arguing the tactics and the strategy behind the strike, not the validity, yes? Many roads lead to the same destination, Trump could have gone about this in a much more covert fashion to achieve the same goal that wouldn’t cause the blowback we’re currently seeing"
He wanted them to know it was us. If we wanted to hide it we easily could have.
Alright dude. War it is.
"Yeah I mean I'm not exactly Gung Ho for war but they definitely, without a doubt, started this shit and we're about to end it. They undoubtedly brought it on themselves."
"Nobody wants war, least of all Iran. Hence their weak ass response to Someimani’s death. You attack us and we’re going to one up you, that’s how deterrence works. You don’t deter someone from messing with you by sneaking up behind them and slapping them in the back of the head, that only pisses them off more. You punch them in the mouth, and if they still want to fight then you go from there. But they obviously don’t judging by their missile strikes which didn’t even do much as hurt anybody because they know it wouldn’t end well for them."
"Trump destroyed isis without invading syria. That is what this sub supported. The same can happen with Iran. One thing is for sure, there will be no boots on the ground in Iran and I doubt we even escalate to war."
Lol since when has ISIS been at all destroyed? This strike will create an entire new crop of radicalized Iranians and Iraqis. They might rebrand to something different but the asymmetrical war will ignite.
Lol what territory do they control? A patch of sand? Where are they? The caliphate was destroyed. Another one may pop up and then we or other nations will take them out.
Because killing people kills an ideology. /s
"Think of the domino effect this strike will have. Iran has outright stated it will retaliate, however it can’t do that through a traditional ground war."
"So, asymmetrical warfare will happen. Homeland killings, terror plots, fuck, years ago ISIS told its followers to act by themselves in the name of the cause. The US will see more and more of that until it stops the endless wars. Bring the boys home. Grow their own garden."
"I don't believe we should be the world's police but I believe we should have a worldly presence if we are to stay on top. That means we have to be connected with all kinds of countries for all kinds of reasons. Some countries will love us for it, others will hate us. It's a fine balancing act that changes constantly. Either we play that game or pack up from all around the world as you suggest, and get left behind while other nations get on top, possibly join forces, and eventually come after us."
"You understand the US has a battle hardened military, and spends more than the next 25 countries combined on their military, all of which are US allies, then come China and Russia."
"The US would be <em>fine</em> bringing their lads home and no one would take a go at them because that military will be just as superior. This fear that developed nations will just...go to war for the fuck of it with the US, in this day and age, is profoundly absurd. They could close up shop overseas, bring the boys home, spend half of what they normally would which is still much, much, much more than their closest “threat”, and be just fucking fine."
"Iran just came out saying they’d attack within the US if the US responds to their missile attacks. As I mentioned above, asymmetrical warfare will be the norm. Kinda hard for a military industrial complex to fight that sort of thing when it’s tailored to traditional warfare. For a “fine balancing act”, Trump has overcommitted his weight to his lead foot. Any wise opponent will attack that leg and further destabilize him."
"This fear that developed nations will just...go to war for the fuck of it with the US, in this day and age, is profoundly absurd. "
"You're thinking short term. After decades of having abandoned allies, losing trade, and not having a physical presence around the world, other nations will fill in our gaps. We become weaker, other nations become stronger, and eventually for whatever reason conflict will break out, as history has proven time and time again."
"I realize now that you're not American, so honestly I don't care what your thoughts are on American foreign policy."
"what do you mean by ""stay on top"" ?"
"Stopping the ""endless wars"" wouldn't stop asshole terrorists from being asshole terrorists. They've been around since before the fucking ottoman empire fell. You know nothing of geopolitics, nor of how war works. Stop being foolish."
"Enlighten me on how the US’ constant fuckery around the globe has not contributed to the rise of anti-US sentiment which in turn manifests in terrorism, as an asymmetrical response to a behemoth of an industrial complex. For all the planes, bombs, guns, ships, tanks, and soldiers, the US was kneecapped by a group of asshole terrorists and two planes. But hey, they’ve been around since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, surely the US removing itself from the equation would have zero effect on terrorism."
"Stopping the ""endless wars"" wouldn't stop asshole terrorists from being asshole terrorists."
It would give them better targets than the USA. They'd go back to targeting each other exclusively.
"No. The last time that was true, international travel was a thousand times more difficult, and radical Islam barely existed. These assholes will keep up their shit until they're totally destroyed, or their country is uniformly rich enough that they stop caring. Literally the only way to stop violence is destruction or apathy."
We didn’t laud Trump for pulling out of Syria. What the fuck? Everyone said it was stupid.
Yes killing gays just because is very progressive
Tldr more whiny bullshit.
"Iran didn’t change at all. They have done nothing but fund international terrorism and support killing Americans. What we did was save American lives by killing a <em>terrorist</em>. Quit capitulating to terrorists, because they only understand murder."
Correction...we funded terrorist by giving Iran the money to fund terrorist during the Obama term.
"Every word of what you said, is wrong."
"Iran is NOT, has not and likely will not in the near future, put ""progressives"" in power."
"Not sure what world you're living in, but it isn't based in reality. Please show me a single progressive measure that these ""progressives"" in Iran have passed and enforced."
"In reality, you're probably thinking of Saudi Arabia which has finally let women drive among other ""progressive"" changes."
"dude theres was huge opposition flowing but completely intellectual opposition, I know Iranians like a said. There was a strong movement coming it just had to take the people wanting that, well now thats done atleast for now"
"Honestly, if the progressives you speak of are serious, then the current events are even more the reason to start effecting the change they want to see."
"Dude , its always the same manufactured paranoia,outrage and talking points with you people isn't it"
When did Iran stop chanting death to america? I must of missed that
They might when the rest of the world does too.
"Congratulation, nothing you said has any connection with reality. Are you confusing Iran with Saudi Arabia or something? Iran is not putting progressives in power."
"Starting wars cause someone ""hates us"" is infantile."
"If that's what you think is happening, someone is lying to you."
"That's not what's happening.   What's happening is Trump is trying to re-establish deterrence.  You know, mess with me and I'll end you so don't fuck with us kind of thing?  "
"Obama ended the deterrence strategy and tried to welcome iran into the global brotherhood of nations by removing sanctions, unfreezing assets, and gifting pallets of cash, all to delay their nuclear ambitions and bribe them to behave themselves.   Wait,  isn't bribery an impeachable offense?  Guess what,  it didn't work,  Iran didn't change their behavior. "
"Anyways,  all of this revitalized their economy and enabled them to wage war by proxy and directly across the middle east.  It also emboldened them to do things like shoot down our drones, take over international shipping vessels, drone bomb Saudi Petrol facilities and fund terrorists."
"So Trump is trying to reverse the disastrous pro iran policies enacted by Obama, in his typical overly blunt way with all the grace of a mountain guerrilla.  Love him or hate him, that's his way but at least he's trying to fix  the damage done by Obama's bad foreign policy decision."
"IANAL but bribery is impeachment worthy of you're doing it for personal gain, not if you're doing it to better the nation or world."
"Iran did change their behaviour under the denuclearization agreement, and after Trump ripped that up they understandingly went back to enriching uranium."
Shooting down drones and the oil shipment vessel damage was done after that agreement was ripped up (see a pattern here?).
The only one who thinks the denuclearization agreement was bad is trump and his supporters. The majority of the world and it's leaders thought it was a good start.
"Iran did change their behaviour under the denuclearization agreement,"
"Where the hell have you been?   Syria, Yemen, Lybia..."
All before Trump.  All after the nuclear deal.  And that's just off the top of my head so I'm sure there's more.
So you're just ignoring the fact that they bombed our embassy? Ok
"The recent violent protests at the American embassy in Iraq? Not a bomb. I don't excuse the action, but accuracy is important."
"Regardless, eye for an eye and all that."
America is supposed to be the more responsible nation. Retaliation and escalation has never been the best approach imo.
Yeah you're right. We should have just sent them pallets of cash for attacking us just like Obama did. -_-
I agree. That’s why Obama sucked as President. It may not be favorable to have a war but at least we’re actually attacking when we ARE attacked. Our embassy in Iraq got hit by Iran before Trump attacked. Trump didn’t start this
there were multiple attacks against us that we let slide before finally retaliating
What attacks did we let slide?
May 2019 Iran attacked tankers in the Gulf 
"June they shot down a US Drone, military wanted to respond but Trump called back the attack"
July iran seized a British oil tanker
Iran attacked the Saudi state ran oil company
Dec they attacked US bases in Iraq 
...and attacked US Embassy. we did not let that slide
So what you’re telling me is that they kept poking  the bear while not expecting to get claws? Your comment just proved that Iran is forcing retaliation to be necessary by continuing to do stuff
yes that's exactly what I'm saying
"Oh my apologies. I got you mixed up with another conversation where I was arguing if retaliation was necessary or not. I was wondering why you seemingly argued against your own point, but turns out you didn’t lol. One negative of Reddit is having multiple conversations about the same subject and getting those conversations mixed up"
"no worries, it happens"
😂😂😂 this is the best!!
"What is going on here? I mean, Trump killed a foreign general ie did something that the entire world condemned and you are joking about it? "
​
The US has invaded numerous countries now and none of them dared to kill the US's general.
"The entire world condemned the killing of a terrorist leader, supporter and organizer?"
No one (not even Iranian allies) have said that Soleimani didn't deserve to die.
"Some are questioning the manner or means in which he was killed, but where are you getting the notion from that ""the entire world condemned [the killing of Soleimani]""? That's just blatantly and objectively false."
"The only people condemning this are liberals, leftists, and those that are staunchly anti Trump."
There are stories and videos of Iraqis and Iranians celebrating this man's death. Literally having parties at baking cakes.
"Lol, read about the Iranian civil war"
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"" rel=""nofollow"">1978?</a>"
"Am I wrong in thinking that we should leave them alone?  I lean isolationist generally, but still."
"They didn’t hate us since 1978, they’ve hated us since 1953. Iran use to be a liberal democracy like us, before we overthrew their government to prevent them from nationalizing their oil."
"I’m fine with going to war with them if they’re attacking us, but I am not convinced that we are not actually there to preserve and protect oil prices."
[removed]
"That image is suggesting that Iran has never ""bombed, sabotaged or attempted a government overthrow"" of any country since WW2?"
Okay...
"See, when you just fund puppet regimes and terrorist organizations in order to do your bidding for you, you get to be the winner of bullshit memes like this one."
I don't disagree. But you can't change the past and Soleimani was a legit target of military action.
I’m agreeing with you.
"So are you too stupid to know the Iran/Iraq war happened or are you just a propaganda stooge for the terrorist regime of Iran (that also funds Hezbollah, which regularly bombs Israel)?"
"Nobody is claiming that. The problem is an immense escalation that might draw the US into another long war that will destabilise the Middle East and indirectly help terrorists.
Just like Iraq."
"It's more like poking a grumpy lion. Yeah, the lion was violent for a long time but you're foolish if you think poking him didn't cause a whole lot of dangerous things to happen. Nobody believes that army base would have still been struck with missiles any time soon had Trump not kicked a hornet nest."
"This meme doesn't explain anything at all. OP person put two things together and thought it made a good point.<br/>
for eg,"
"I like milk.<br/>
Milk comes from boobies. "
wow so amazing  
"This is a copy and pasted from another redditor. I don't have the username to give credit, sorry."
​
"Remember that this was caused by Trump saying that Iran wasn’t in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal, then we pulled out with no alternative agreement in place, then we sanctioned the fuck out of Iran which led to tensions between Iran/US relations, which then led to us disproportionately killing Suleimani without any attempts at diplomatic de-escalation, which then led to Iran bombing US military bases."
This was completely preventable and 100% caused by Trump.
So what do you make of the embassy attacked by Iran before Trump attacked Soleimani?
"Trump pulled out of the Iran deal and then absolutely squashed Iran with economic sanctions. Which over the past year has not only lead to Iran no longer complying with the nuclear sanctions, but also heightened tensions with the US. This recent escalation started with pulling out of the Iran deal. Our Allies were vigorously against it, and rightfully so, look where we are now."
Which allies were against that? Do you mean the globalist controlled countries like France or when Theresa May was still running the UK? 
"Also I do agree that it’s not exactly the best foreign policy to just withdraw from a newly created deal. HOWEVER you have to remember Trump wasn’t the one who made that Iran deal. That deal was mostly bullshit anyway. It just delayed when Iran would use nuclear capabilities instead of preventing it, and it forced the US to essentially bribe them for the delay. "
Trump still offered to negotiate a new deal with Iran just as he was doing with North Korea. The North Korean deal fell through in the end but he made a large effort there. He absolutely DID try to make a deal with Iran and that can not be ignored.
Another thing to remember is you’re seriously blaming Trump for causing tension with a country that’s been hating us since Jimmy Carter was President? Sanctions against them aren’t new. Please stop pretending it is.
"First off, you want to belittle our allies as if their support means nothing, then you claim the Iran deal was bullshit...?How can you say the Iran deal is bullshit? They literally were unable to produce nuclear weapons until 2030. All in exchange for unfreezing their assets and letting them stabilize their economy which in return would help stabilize the Middle East. Yes tensions have been high for a long time, the Iran deal was a huge step forward when it came to diplomacy with Iran and the Middle East. Apparently you like zero foreign policy opposed to some. I never blamed Trump for causing tensions, I blamed him for recent ESCALATION of the tensions and a step backwards for our Middle East relations. Selective reading must be a nice attribute to have, you never have to read anything that is contrary to your clouded intelligence."
In what way is giving Iran billions of dollars to DELAY a program a good sense of foreign policy? I’ll wait for you to explain that. I said that in my last comment but you didn’t even respond to that. Funny how you think I’M the one with selective reading and you couldn’t even read my rationale for hating the deal. 
Trump tried to negotiate a brand new deal with them and they wouldn’t accept. Does that seriously sound like him escalating it to you? Grow up. Trump didn’t escalate this. Iran escalated when they attacked the embassy.
Do you understand how foreign economical sanction work? Do you think it’s one country “giving” billions of dollars to another? Is that what you think the US is doing under the Iran deal? hahahaha. I’m sorry I’m done with this....Unfreezing their own assets is giving someone billions of dollars cash apparently! I would suggest reading up on the deal before the inevitable next time you try and justify pulling out of the Deal. 
"Edit: Also, delaying a nuclear program is PROGRESS, it gives time for a safe Middle East, a more stabilized relationship with Iran and in the end limits the amount of nuclear super powers on earth. But apparently a Trump is so good at making deals, that if he can’t negotiate a deal he likes, there will be just no deal now.  That’ll show Iran! Got em good!"
Giving them billions is quite literally exactly what happened under Obama. Do you seriously not read what’s going on or something?

"It wasn’t progress for anything. It was just delaying what Iran was wanting, and Iran chose to break their own side of the deal. Remember they didn’t just sign the deal with the US. Many countries were involved. One country leaving the deal shouldn’t have made them break their side. "

So the money was to settle the Iran-US dispute dating back to 1979? Did you even read the articles you linked? I did. 
"Regardless, the US contributes over 1/4 of the entires worlds GDP and then backed out of the the deal, and then imposed drastic economic sanctions on Iran. Iran could no longer capitalize on their oil exports and were put in a tough spot. Of course their going to back out of the deal that’s a lose-lose. "
"Perhaps read this: <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">Iran Deal</a>"
"And this <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/iran-s-economy-impact-of-nuclear-deal-and-sanctions-3306349"" rel=""nofollow"">impact of the nuclear deal</a>"
"Settling the dispute is still giving them money, is it not?  You're arguing about the justification, not the fact."
"We didn’t owe them money. Giving them billions was not an answer to anything. Doesn’t matter what the justification was, because it’s really fucking convenient timing that Obama started payments right when the Iran Deal was agreed upon. "
Iran could no longer capitalize on their oil exports and were put in a tough spot. Of course their going to back out of the deal 
We weren’t buying their oil in the first place! The hell you talking about? We didn’t stop buying oil from them or ban our allies from buying from them. 
Of course their going to back out of the deal that’s a lose-lose.
"So suddenly it’s ok to break deals? They still had the deal with Germany, UK, Russia, and China but you’re suddenly ok with a deal being broken? If it’s such a good deal then Trump pulling us out of the deal wouldn’t have led to that happening on their end lol"
"the only countries against it were the Russians, are you ""colluding with the Russians"" ®?"
There have been sanctions on Iran since 1980.
"Didn't ""copy and paste"" it from another redditor."
"Found it online in another forum and posted it here. It's a meme, so I don't really feel the need to link to the source when it is unlikely that the place I got it from was the original source anyways."
The text is pointing out the ridiculousness othe leftists who act like Trump's killing of Soleimani caused Iran to hate us when they've been hating us for decades.
"Iran before the killing of Soleimani: ""Death to America!"""
"Iran after the killing kr Soleimani: ""Death to America!"""
How does it feel to protect terrorists over your own nation and citizens? Do you have the urge to change your username to Jane Fonda II?
No offense but that format and font are both over 8 years old
I didn't make it. Thought it was funny and shared it.
Thanks for your input though! I'll be sure to only share memes with up-to-date memology next time!
"My biggest complaint is that with the Iran Deal we were beginning to normkze relations, and work towards a deescalated Moddle East, but we threw that out the window with no other agreement in place, and slapped sanctions back on."
"The Deal was good, and could've been improved upon"
"No, we weren't normalizing relations. We were paying off someone mafia-style to keep them in line; except they weren't following the deal either way."
"The EU needs to follow suit and pull out of their similar deals with Iran or, as usual, the U.S. is left to carry the load of dealing with Iran."
"And yes, Iran needs to be dealt with in some way so long as they are willing to try and bully the world into appeasement. Deterrence is the appropriate action but they have been appeased for so long, that they are trying their hand and will ultimately lose. I just hope the ""loss"" comes sooner rather than later for the sake of American lives. Ideally, Iran backs down without any casualties and no one, Iran or otherwise, wants a full-scale war."
"I dont agree we were paying them off mafia style. We didnt give them any money, and opened them up to our businesses. Allowing Western business in would hahe provided the necessary pressure top keep them in line.  "
"They also were following the deal until we ripped it up, sp to say they weren't is a lie. We extended their breakout time for nuclear weapons while spreading a clean energy source, and opening a new market floor or business interests. "
"When have we appeased Iran? It feels like we've been doing anything but since the 1990s, and it's been a long line of escalation since until 2015, and then a sharp reversal. Iran is no worse than Saudi Arabia, yet we're appease the latter nonstop. The deal could've provided us with a way to check the power of both nations in the middle east.  "
"I pray for no war, and hope cooler heads prevail"
"We didnt give them any money,"
*ignores 160 million dollars dropped off in the middle of the night by Obama
"That 160 mil wasn't dropped off on planes, and is an overestimate of the money. It also wasn't given to them, but was already their money that we had frozen due to sanctions. When we lifted sanctions, as per the agreement, it unfroze their assets to a much smaller amount than $160mil, most of which wasn't even cash but other investments"

"Obama administration officials had claimed that without a deal with Iran, The Hague tribunal might have imposed an even higher interest penalty on the United States."
"Bellinger agreed that that was a concern. “There was a significant risk, based on its judgments in recent years, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal would have issued a decision awarding a larger amount to Iran,” he said. “If the tribunal had done that, and the U.S. government was then unwilling or unable to pay the award, the U.S. would have violated its obligations under the Algiers Accords.” He said “it was prudent to settle the claims, even if it required the U.S. to take the highly unpalatable action of making a payment to Iran.”"
"Looks like that money was legal, and in repayment to Iran for money that was theirs according to your WaPo source. Seems like we paid them that to settle outstanding claims, and prevent being penalized more."
"Omar didnt side with iran just because she hates trump.  She sided with iran because she is an islamist and hates America.  And I mean that literally, she thinks America is terrible."
It’s almost like her district is pro terrorism and hates America too how did she get elected? Like here in mass we didnt know what we were getting into with the baker taker
"Her district even has the highest density of Samalian’s in the entire country, wonder how that happened?"
impeach her already!
No need to impeach. Congress has the power power to expel their own members.
Because they will NEVER admit trump or the republican party is right or that obamass had absolutely NO experience in diplomacy.
"Exactly.  If anyone does, it will be a short blurb next to the obituaries in the daily paper."
I actually saw people trying to claim it was a warning shot. The problem is that that's not how this works. Iran already vowed retaliation. You don't fire a warning shot after you've already declared retaliation. They showed their hand and called their own bluff.
History will judge Trump as a genius here
With 1 shot he shut them down.  No need for ground troops or an invasion.  Be bitch slapped them with 1 shot.
"The same could have been done with Iraq, but Bush was committed to regime change and then subsequently got roped into nation building and a counterinsurgency. A few precision airstrikes on Saddam's command structure and he would have folded too. This is why we must reject the false dilemma that the left and the isolationists present us with that there are only two options: appeasement or all out ground war."
Because Orange Man Bad
Because of Orange man bad. Even when he does good they can't admit it and that stubbornness is going to cost them the 2020 election.
Why do rich Americans hate the very country that made them rich?
"It’s not that they hate America, it’s that they hate paying their workers and foreigners can be tricked into working minimum for jobs that ought to pay much more."
"If we only had more native-born PhD Engineers who were willing to work for $60K per year, they wouldn’t have to resort to this."
/s
"Put another way, it's not that the rich hate America.  It's that the rich hate <em>Americans.</em>  Because they can't as easily take advantage and profit from Americans like they can with foreigners.  The solution?  Import many more foreigners, of course!"
"The rich in Europe have similar issues, by the way."
Also it’s more profitable to hate your country. So there’s that
"they believe that if you feed the crocodile it will not eat you. Little do they know, feeding the crocodile results in it eating them last."
Rich socialists in a nutshell. Every one of them is a future Kulak if they get their way.
Science will never unlock the mysteries of the liberal mind.
"Eh, he's probably exploited people in other countries too, if he's a globalist. That said, the guy is openly unpatriotic if he wants to keep highly qualified Americans from gaining employment in their own country. SMH."
"I'm sure he's all for qualified Americans gaining employment as long as they lower their standards and expectations in order to ""compete""."
Are they <em>trying</em> to lose???
They have supporters.
Which is just bizarre.  Telling people to “learn to code” and telling companies to hire people from other countries instead of Americans?  That’s a winning strategy?  Mind-blown!
"No, they're just insane. They are insane asylum inmates who are trying to run the asylum."
How can <em>anyone</em> who obviously hates Americans as much as Dems do even come close to winning???
Nearly every country has rules ensuring that their own citizens enjoy preference on the labour market. Try getting a work permit for an EU country as an American.
😂😂😂😂
"I'm fairly convinced that the billionaire elites wish to completely eradicate the concept of ""nations"" and ""countries."" They want a one world government with a one world economy. Makes business wider and yet simpler for them."
You should hire the best people with a heavy preference for Americans... How is this not logic?
This guy is so out of touch with mainstream America that it’s no wonder he is only polling at 4%.  The only people that like him are other rich elitists who love unrestricted free-market economics but want to tell the rest of us how to live because they “know better”.
The beauty of it is he is such a narcissist he will probably run third party when he doesn't get the nom.
Kinda like how Boeing did before all the 737 MAX issues.
A vote for a Democrat is a vote for unemployment.
I swear he is like a nasally version of Joe Biden with the gaffs.
"well in some respects, he's right because so many companies and government entities have so many useless do-nothing employees.  and having a foreigner work for pennies on the dollar to do a useless job is much less costly than having a domestic worker to do a useless job."
but the better option is to not have those positions at all.
Do these people really believe this shit? Or are they just pandering to their liberal base they raised?
"We need the best billionaires. That's why we hired the best Russian, Trump, to be our president. /s"
They should just move over there
Sounds about right.
MSNBC bunch a commies
Isn't that a bit redundant?
"Devil's Advocate, but as someone who has always questioned the effectiveness of sanctions, doesn't the fact that they are already heavily sanctioned and yet still acting in a manner which warrants further sanctions suggestive of the fact that the original sanctions weren't working to begin with? I mean, unless everyone else is participating ala South Africa or Rhodesia, they can always find someone else to do business with. "
"Further, if they are hurting anyone, is it the government, or the people? North Korea's leaders seem to be doing fine despite reports that their countrymen are starving. "
"Further still, at a certain point do sanctions not effect the free market as well; something it has been argued is contrary to conservative ideals?"
"-she appears to be as brilliant as Chelsea Clinton, though not as wealthy, yet."
"Out of curiosity why does the Ivanka, Kushner, Don Jr, and Eric get a pass on the Nepotism hate. Would you be cool with the next Dem President appointing his kid as an advisor (Ivanka) and her/his husband in charge of Middle East Peace?"
Because their father wasn't a politician when he got rich. Hillary daughter and Bidens son have both benefited from their parents.
That's actually the entire point.  
"The radical left has tried to use children as human shields for their bad ideas before, notably after Parkland.  But the figures they chose - a potty-mouthed little fascist, a Sinead O'Connor impersonator - were so ridiculous that the natural response was the involuntary defense of laughter.  "
"So they went back to the drawing board and selected a hostage with an obvious developmental disorder, thinking that you'd be too ashamed to laugh at someone with autism.  "
"But, as the article points out, they simply don't control the narrative anymore.  And people are laughing at them again."
How long until she goes full Macaulay Culkin?
How many times did ol’ Kevin from Home Alone tell us he was going to put people up against the wall?  I think she’s far beyond Culkin territory.
Yeah his parents were just abusive and money hungry.
Apparently his father signed a licensing agreement to his likeness with the company that made a Pagemaster video game based on the movie and never told him / gave him a dime of the money.  He didn’t even know the game existed till last year when he found it in a retro store.
The victim of socialists using mentally ill kids as mouthpieces in their economy destroying quest of world political domination

"I don't think its ever really necesary to attack a child, and Greta actually is a pretty impressive kid all things considered.  But she is clearly part of a huge suspiciously well connected marketing campaign.  "
People everywhere need to consider just how easily they are manipulated by this kind of foolishness.  We have too many useful idiots who accept others telling them how to think.
"This kid eats snot, swallows gum and pennies. I don’t think she really knows that much about the weather."
How DARE you!
Obamass and kerry (who's married to heinz ketchup by the way) have no experience in diplomacy in the middle. Their left was waving to America and their right hand gave terrorist money and nuclear weapons power. Thank you billary also
"Netanyahu has been looking for a reason to bring Iran to its knees. Israel has been the victim of <em>decades</em> of relentless, Iranian backed, terrorism directed towards them."
I'm all for Israel thumping Iran. It's long overdue.
"Iran is trying to demonstrate that it is still a regional power but without provoking all out war. Most likely scenario is that they will continue missile attacks on local targets like Erbil. Iran will vent their frustration on the Kurds, a known US ally, but not important enough for the US to help."
Player 3 has entered the game.
"So, the US and the entire middle east minus Iran, VS. Iran and Russia"
This could be good.
Russia by proxy though I’d say. If we’re in there as the US I can’t imagine Putin would actually send in official Russian military.
they will be on vacation like in Ukraine
"If he wouldn't send in official Russian military when we were killing Russian mercenaries in Syria, he won't do it for Iran. And we shouldn't send troops either. Just let the rest of the mideast fight Iran."
"Note to Iran:  Unlike you, Israel does not bluff."
How would Iran be able to count the bodies
Their missiles told them.
Yeah those weird missiles that get up and run home after they've hit something.
Yeah who stands to have egg on their face here. 
"Iran lying , and no one really going to call them out."
"The U.S. lying, and getting caught in said lie with 80 families and husbands/wives are blowing up the news media about their military spouse stationed in Iraq suddenly going missing."
They also used a 2003 bomb photo lol.
"Also I would like to give a friendly reminder to all democrats, that if Pelosy had sent the articles to the senate, and Trump was as guilty as she said he is, he would have been removed, and none of the Iranian stuff would've happened. "
So what are you waiting for Nancy ? Send them over to the senate. Do you truly want evil Trump to keep being president ?
No one in iran will know the truth but a few people with internet access
History Teacher: Class who wants to tell me who lost the Brief 2020 US-Iranian Conflict?  
Student: Iran?  
"History Teacher: Nope, yes they lost a key general and some proxy fighters but got off with relatively few casualties. "
Student: The US then?  
"History Teacher: No, they eliminated an enemy, had no casualties, and got Iran to stop many of the proxy war activities against them.  "
Student: Who then?  
History Teacher: Ukraine.  
"Student: What?  That doesn't even make sense, they weren't involved in the conflict.  "
"History Teacher: Yes, but some trigger happy idiot in the Iranian military mistook a commercial Ukrainian airline taking off from Iran for an enemy aircraft and blew it out of the sky.  176 people were killed and Iran very quickly covered it up blaming mechanical issues.  "
In all seriousness this is really sad.  The families are never likely to get justice because it's unlikely Iran will ever cooperate with an investigation or admit that they mistakenly shot down the plane.
Seemed like the obvious conclusion. Iran on high alert fearing retaliation mistakes commercial aircraft as US plane.
She needs to retire.
"No she doesn't.  At this rate, she's a net plus for the Republicans."
Like ten years ago.
Was Trump eating ice cream though? Becuase that's really important.
Try the veal.
Priorities. Open bar?
So they fired a dozen missiles at Iraqi air bases Tuesday night. We are told they killed no one.
"And they tweeted out, “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.”"

Lmao it's so obvious that Iran is just trying to save face in front of it's own people.
Also Michelle Williams should have exercised self control and not had unprotected sex.  It’s fine to not want children and take measures to prevent their conception it’s entirely different to conceive and then destroy.
Self control? How <em>dare</em> you lecture a Hollywood elite about moral issues!
/s
This is the part that blows my mind when you hear feminazi and lefty elites whining that we want to strip women of the right to choose. Bitch you <em>chose</em> to have unprotected sex. These people genuinely believe the world would be better off without consequences for any of their actions.
"When I think of this issue, I always think of this passage, especially the ""without natural affection"" part.  A mother's love for her child is one of the strongest natural urges humans - or any animals - have.  "
"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
"Michelle, next time you don't wish to be kept from your dreams, think condom."
"And it isn't feminism to tell women we're hampered by our biology and by being mothers, so let's just kill the baby and not take care of you and your needs. Just kill it. It's fine. It's just a 'termination,' a 'clump of cells,' a 'choice'. We should not be told we have to kill our children to be the people we want to be, to live our lives, to have successful careers but the world tells us it's necessary. And all you feminists whinging about patriarchy - that's it right there, telling us we are inferior and cannot complete our life goals unless we kill our children! Upholding that lie is the worst  fucking thing modern day feminism has given us."
"Sure they do. Ask a father when his wife or kid isn't around if having kids was good for his marriage, job, social life, etc. "
Look around. Most parents are miserable.
"""We?"" No... ""We"" didn't stop it. "
"The US commander in Chief, President Donald J. Trump, and the United States Military stopped it."
"""We"" are a divided nation, in which half of Americans considered the slaying of Soleimani as a vile and despicable act against a beloved general."
"Thank you President Trump and the men &amp; women of our armed forces, for a job well done!"
"That guy had ties with Hezbollah and has killed many innocent people in many countries, besides the USA. Other countries, mine included, are indebted for the USA actually killing this piece of shit and preventing more bombings in the world."

"""Dog faces pony show"".  Would hate to have to diagram one of Biden's 5 minute long sentences. Looking for the subject, predicate is like ""Where's Waldo?"" Maybe that's what English teachers have to do if they end up in hell."
"And when Fuentes said: “When he &lt;Biden&gt; speaks, you feel that he means what he says,” Fuentes is mistaken. Biden actually  has no idea what he is saying. Listen to this answer; you go from Defense Dept spending to his family's health history to the loss of House seats, not to mention being ""proofey that the American public has been through this (?) before"" and of course the ""dog faces pony show"", whatever that is.  And he is their front runner?"
And he is their front runner?
"Well, I feel good about that."
The big fucking deal turned out to be a big fucking disaster.
Isn't home ownership the best way to accumulate wealth in your family?
Yeah but it's not <em>fairrr</em> that your family should be wealthier than others'.
My mortgage isnt even that much higher than the rent was on the old apartment.

... why?
Property is pretty much a lock to increase in value over time.
If you can afford an asset their is almost no logical reason to not own it yourself instead of renting.
'' No one is saying that we should be socialists/communists you are just being paranoid ! ''&lt; Leftists.
"So who should own those properties? Why should I rent and fill someone else’s coffers? Doesn’t that make my landlord more wealthy than me? Are they saying that the government should own them, and we should rent from them?"
Well technically the government does own it. Stop paying property taxes and they will take it.
"Technically, they don't own it. Stop paying property taxes and they may seize it and sell it to get the tax money, but they aren't going to seize it and hold on to it.  You own the land, you own the building, subject to liens and mortgages."
Not that we don't already pay rent in the form of property tax but let's give even more. How else can they afford all their free stuff.
LOL Twenty years ago they were championing home ownership in the AA community.
The blind leading the blind.
"So instead of paying for a house I can sell later, I pay taxes for my house and my neighbors house, never get anything back, never stop having to pay, and the money winds up via federal contracts in some megacorp owner's pocket to then funnel back into politicians interminable election campaigns."
"Granted, housing is probably more consumption item than investment over the short periods people stay in one place any more, and your benefit is mostly from eventually paying it off so you can put that part of the budget to use elsewhere.  Private ownership still allows for that to happen though!"
Comments like that make just go absolutely insane.

I think they were given a set date to hand them over or the Senate would continue without it?

"Edit: you're openly saying you're glad politicians are ""finally"" playing dirty? Lmao"
Fake impeachment
They have until Saturday
It'll happen Friday afternoon. Dems want this to go away quietly.
I wasn’t aware of a deadline.  What defines the deadline?
The Senate Majority leader who said he would wait that long before voting to dismiss.
"They passed a procedural bill that gives the house 25 days to pass the articles to the Senate, or it will be dismissed"
The Republicans changed the law to suit them.  Again.
Where does it say that the Democrats can sit on the articles until they see fit?  You seriously can't talk about changes in procedures at all.  BTW Feinstein is a Democrat from Pelosi's state so there's that.
"Because they didn't charge Trump with ""crimes and misdemeanors"", the Senate can just dismiss it. But Fineswine is right. It sounds like ""We have to hurry up and impeach Trump for the good of the nation"" and then never do it."

There’s something not adding up here...
Can you summarize?  You mean with Mike Lee?
"Seems so, Reuters, who I take as a non biased news reporting service seems to have a pretty solid back drop on the situation.  Seems like this information about what lead up to the most recent drone attack.  Lots of emotion, which is understandable.  If Reuters is accurate seems like this cat was working steadfast to cause real harm to many folks outside of Iran and including on US and Iraqi persons."
If there was even the slightest chance solemani was planning an attack on american how could any of them disagree with the decision to take him out? We didnt lose a single american life and potentially saved hundreds. Wtf are these guys pissed about?
If you listened to Lee he wasn't upset with the strike. He was upset with the briefers for not being able to explain what would make them come to congress and ask to declare war/use of force. He was upset because the briefers basically said the administration is going to make that decision and congress would gave to follow along. Understand his frustration even he said he would have to talk to the admin directly about it. Sounds like the briefers came unprepared to brief thats all.
"Fair enough but what is with the blind support for Trump without any evidence to back it up? Genuinely curious why you guys/girls are fine with him refusing to release his taxes, refusing to let anyone in his admin testify/turn over documents, etc..I just don't understand why does Trump who lies constantly (sorry but that's undeniable) get a pass and doesn't ever have to show proof?"
"Why should he turn his taxes over? There is nothing that forces him to, it’s not a requirement to run for the office. Why doesn’t Pelosi release hers, or Schumer. Any documents are cherry picked and edited to release lies by the MSM. How about the leaking to the press?"
Does anyone else ever get the feeling that day to day life in Washington DC must be just one long dick measuring contest?
These Bozos need to have their egos checked.
Or when Iran shot down a $123 Million dollar drone over international waters in June of 2019.
Or when Iran burnt down the US embassy in Iraq and tried to kill the Americans inside just like in Libya?
"Yeah, Trump starts a lot of garbage fires, but he sure as hell didn't start this one."
He didn't start the fire. It was always burning since the world's been turning.
"Reagan, Palestine, terror on the airline.

"This song came on the radio today and I never looked into the history of it.  Joel wrote it in response to a 21 year old dude who was complaining that it was a terrible time to be 21, in 1989.  And the dude tried to tell Joel that nothing bad happened in the 50s and 60s.  "
"Each generation, at least in the USA, has it better than the previous generations.  Imagine being 21 in 1940.  Or 21 in 1966.  Imagine the president sending armed forces to a state to protect the citizens because of bad race relations.  Imagine the most prominent black leader in history, getting assassinated.  Or the president having his head literally blown off for all to see, the most popular president aside from maybe Lincoln or Washington.  "
"I mean, 1968 was a pretty rough year for Americans.  MLK is assassinated in April.  Two months later, Robert Kennedy is assassinated.  In Vietnam, the tet offensive marked the beginning of the end for the Americans.  "
"Millennials and ztards think Trump is going to start ww3 with a third world country.  Meantime, there no safer place in history to be alive than right now in the United States.

"If things get better for every generation, doesn't that mean that the incremental changes in society and government are a good thing, and that those who fight against change are holding us back from building a better world?"
"I see the progress of technology progressively improving the lives of many Americans. But if you look at the cost of college since Pell Grants and Federally insured loans have come into common practice, they have skyrocketed. Government also allows huge pharma corporations to sell medicine invented a hundred years ago without competition through patents, sometimes millennia for drugs used even in Rome. It's a good thing we have the Clean Air and Water Act for sure. But the ratio of good laws to poorly enacted (even if well meaning) laws isn't anywhere near 1:1, more like 1:10. But yes both parties have enacted terrible policies that horribly mismanage our economies and artificially prop us up through bad monetary and economic policy(see bank bailouts), and while I do not blame neo-liberalisms intentions for the most part(other than the drug war, literal war and post-9/11 security apparatus), it is the outcomes I blame. So no, it is not better laws that have made society grow and prosper, it is in spite of those laws that we have continued to grow."
"This is how easy 21st century Americans have it.  Because more and more people are working from home, in offices, and getting away from manual labor, we've started to work out.  Our bodies need  to be active.  We go to gyms because we literally do nothing at work.  Unless you are in some sort of manual labor field, you likely need the exercise so you don't lose muscle mass.  It's just crazy.  I wish these fuckers would have to go pump water by hand.  Or tend to a field that will mean your family lives through the winter or dies.  "
"Oh no, Trump said something offensive on Twitter.  We're all gonna die.  George Carlin was a god damn genius.  He always said when you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show.  Americans get front row seats.  I'm gonna eat some popcorn, Milkduds, and enjoy the fun of 2020."

Thank you. Too many people supporting the drone strikes purely becuase democrats opposed them. 
"Just because Trump does it, doesnt make it good."
"I feel like we aren’t talking enough about the fact the strike occurred at an operating civilian airport. I’m glad Soleimani is dead, but I also recognized that an international airport is ridiculous place for a drone strike. "
"There were American flights en route and on the ground at the time, I believe."
"That's a very good point, one I hadn't heard before. How close to the airport was he?"
Edit:
Correction: the car had just left the airport and was driving immediately adjacent to the airport. I had originally thought they were on site at the airport. Sorry for the misinformation.

How is it bad that he did it? They attacked an embassy so we should just have Trump sit by and sleep in like Clinton did with Benghazi?
There is nothing wrong with a defensive strike against an Iranian terrorist openly trying to murder more Americans
"Getting dragged into another forever war and having American young adults killed in another unneeded conflict is something I'd rather not have. We should be investing in soft power, in diplomacy. If we do not do such, then we'll be needing more bullets and missiles."
Sometimes tit-for-tat is the strategy that leads to the most blood spilled. When will we draw the line on the human cost of war?
We are not getting dragged into a war you terrorist sycophant.  We acted in defense of Americans last week.
"2800 attacks against low-ranking targets, which oftened killed innocent people, were bad. Not all of them, but a larger portion than I'm comfortable with."
"I can a great deal less about one attack against a very high-ranking targer that had just instigated an attempt against one of our embassies. Sure, democrats claim that all they did was start a few fires and throw trash around, but that's how Benghazi (also instigated by this man) started, too. Had Trump not called out the marines, it would have ended with dead ambassadors and US soldiers. Iran is on notice now. Trump is not Obama. He will not look the other way in service of deals Iran had no intention of keeping. Attacking us will reap reprisals."
"If reddit wasn't so full of non-Americans, there would be significantly less opposition to Trump's actions on this front. You only see this kind of response among international types. A handful of liberals and a lot of people who get no say in American politics."
i love when we get brigaded with only 135 upvotes. Smells like fear.
"I will admit their memory is horrible, but Obama used the AUMF from the already existing war in Iraq. Expanding into Syria was another case of the POTUS having too much unilateral power imo. Congress needs to take some power back, but that's not a Trump issue. It's a Congress focused too much on bickering than anything."
"Also, this attack has unified Iranians, and forced them to seemingly get over their protests. I wish we had given support (moral, diplomatic, not $) to those who wanted a more free Iran, rather than killing a leader. Feel like we could've played a different game here, but I'm not in charge so that doesnt matter"
"Hello conservatives of Reddit, resident liberal here, I assure you we are all in agreement that Obama was a war criminal. There is no defending his military actions from any perspective, just thought I could share some common ground to spark a potential conversation. I know you all get painted as awful on this website, but I also know deep down, just like everyone else, you want America and Americans to prosper. 2020 is the year we realize we all want the same things."

What Trump did to the Iranian general was an objectively good thing.
How he did it is objectively not.
I also remember when Hillary helped fund ISIS in Syria after they destroyed Libya. As an Arab this is infuriating how they pretend nothing happened. The Democrats created the biggest and wealthiest terrorist organization in history. It wasnt until Putin and trump working deals that they've finally been wiped out.
"I also remember McCain meeting and wanting to help freaking Al Qaeda in Syria. So, terrorists in Afghanistan = bad. Same terrorists in Syria = good."
I also remember when the Trump org did a deal in Baku with oligarchs connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard including the same general who was just assassinated.
Why does everyone act like the President needs Congressional permission? The President is the Commander-in-Chief and can order strikes without a declaration of war. The only powers granted to Congress by the Constitution is the budget over the military and the power to declare war (formally). To act like the President needs permission to use military assets to secure our interests is an overreach by Congress.
"I think it is because the scope of what is ""war"" is today alot less clear than 150, 100, or 50 years ago. "
"Additionally, Is ventilating an executive of a foreign country an act of war? Or is this guy, because he is an objectively very bad actor, deserving of no more thought than a run of the mill combatant?"

"How about some consistency here, instead of attacking Democrats all day."
"Obama did it without congressional approval, so did Trump. Both actions are bad."
Hmmm but Congress passed the legislation which has allowed the executive to bypass congressional approval in the first place. Now it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle.
Wasn’t Libya also unauthorized?

Or when the US shot down a plane carrying 233 people from Iran going to a religious site where one in six people have to visit in their life
You might want to look at the background behind that.
"The <em>reason</em> that jet was fired on was that Iran had a habit of disguising hostile military assets as civilian ones until the last minute, and the previous week, an Iranian jet had fired a missile at a US warship that damaged it and killed 37 sailors."
"The jet that we downed was repeatedly queried for ID by radio and refused to answer.  Because it was in a position to fire at the ship that downed it had it been a military aircraft, and was refusing to respond to radio hails, it was shot down."
Whataboutism
The Council on Foreign Relations found that Barack Obama bombed seven different countries during his last year in office. Alone.
Remember that time Obama targeted and killed an American citizen with a drone back in 2011?
"Remember when Saudi arabia executed the worst attacks on us soil since pearl harbour and Republicans started a multi trillion dollar war which killed 100's of thousands against countries very loosely involved... See it goes both ways... Sims of the past do not excuse sins of the present. The worst sin is none of us learned and we are repeating past mistakes only 18 years later. Shame on us, yes us... Not Republicans, not Democrats . All of us."
"No, I don't remember this at all. This never happened."
Massive brain
This whole Middle East war has been a shitshow from the get go. And now it’s just all sorts of fucked up.
What Trump did was act in self defense by preventing the most prominent terrorist in the region from slaughtering more Americans.  Nobody wants war but Iran wants terrorism.
If you say so. Provoking war with Iran is only putting more Americans and allies in harms way if you ask me but fuck it I just hope that Trump has a strategy to deal with further Iranian escalation without going to war.
We did not provoke war with Iran.  Iran provoked war with us and we did the bare minimum to defend ourselves.
"At this point it doesn’t matter, what’s done is done. The question now is if this escalates to war with Iran. I personally hope it doesn’t."
Nobody wants war with Iran except those select few who will benefit from it.
"On the bright side, Iran has little to gain and much to lose by escalating. The war will be on their soil, and their regime will be toppled."
I hope it doesn’t too.  But you can blame Iran if it does
It won't.
"when salami goes on vacation, he went everywhere."
Did conservatives generally approve of Obama's drone strikes?
"For the most part I'd say yes, as part of the ongoing conflicts they're preferable to putting our troops in harm's way. Some of them were pretty questionable though, namely the hit on al-Awlaki given that his son, a 16 year old U.S. citizen, was killed along with him."
I approve of killing terrorists.
"Some do, some don’t.  The point is the liberals and the democrats are being hypocrites for being fine with Obama doing it but when Trump does something similar they lose their minds."
Understood.
"""Similar""? When did Obama assassinate a head of state? "
"If he really needed to be eliminated, then you do it with some shred of plausible deniability.  If this specific person needed to be removed, there are multiple ways to do it, quietly. If you are looking to do more than just kill one person, you blow him up with a missile and claim responsibility.  "
"What Obama did was wrong. What Trump did was wrong AND stupid. Unless the objective was to get into war with Iran, then I guess well played Mr President."
All of this hand wringing is kind of goofy. We're not in a war with Iran are we? No. We're not likely to be.
"You mean some did and some didn’t. 
I actually recall a lot of out cry when those events occurred. "
“Libruhls” is not a monolithic entity.
"But anyway, it’s amazing how you yell “hypocrite” and completely fail to see they same thing applies to you in exactly the same way."
No . That’s one of the biggest talking points with conservatives .
"It's the hypocrisy. Why is it when Obama launches drone strikes no one says anything, but bad when Trump does it?"
"For me, a dead terrorist is a good terrorist, whether killed by a Democrat or Republican. I applaud Obama for taking out Bin Laden and I applaud Trump for taking out Sulejmani."
"I mean, Yeah."
"Depends on the context of the strike. Killing an American citizen, no. Legitimate military targets were no problem."
Don't forget Obama ordering the killing of American civilians without due process because they were on his kill list.
"Who, and when did this happen?  Not doubting you, just curious."

"The guy below linked before I could. They were terrorists or whatever, supposedly. Regardless, they were American citizens and had rights."
"So they left the US to join ISIS and got killed, but we’re technically American citizens?"
"Correct. Although ""technically"" sounds a bit like ""barely."" They were definitely Americans and some of them were minors."
Dems pointing this out were on the news cycle for 30 seconds.
SO your argument is...Obama did dumb things so trump can?
"Or is your argument, Obama ignored congress (which republicans a hated) so trump can do that now ( which republicans love?"
​
"I'm sorry, I don't get your point other than to say that....Trump = Obama?"
The argument is Democrats have short term memory loss.

"Ah yes. Employing the ""Hold my beer"" method. Super cool idea."
I wish this post would blow up so the Democrats can see it
"The protests and unrest in Iran during the months before the airstrike symbolised disapproval towards the regime (to put it mildly). But now the country has come together towards a common enemy. The world is a better place without Soleimani in it, but his assassination was a godsend for the people in charge over there, and not a great move by Trump."
You are lying through your teeth in defense of a terrorist.  People in Iran were celebrating the death of that terrorist general scumbag.

Why did we shoot it down?  And did we pay restitution to the victims?
The funny thing is that if you bring up any of this it will get dismissed by the left for being a whataboutism. The left uses whataboutism as a shield to not acknowledge the shitty things that their side does and it is beyond pathetic. The left believes they are superior and they believe that their side can't be involved in any wrongdoing. 
This is the same left that claims what an awesome president Obama was...
That golden smile now got him rich as hell!
Good for him. I was secretly hoping it would bankrupt some of the fakenews.
"CNN is  owned by WarnerMedia, which is owned by AT&amp;T. They are made up of brands such as Cartoon Network, HBO, WB..... and many more. This lawsuit  wasn't bankrupting them."
The settlement would most likely barely make a small blip in their accounting in terms of the global company.
"Much of the MSM has been bankrolled by billionaires for awhile now. Because they're an established brand, they aren't held accountable for the fake news they spew and worth keeping afloat as a propaganda outlet. Meanwhile a small indendent news company makes one misstep and all MSM collectively runs hit pieces to try to discredit them."
It was literally just a smile...lololo.
You can bet all that money they got wont repair the damage of a lifetime of bad press
It certainly won't. I wouldn't be shocked if he is still receiving death threats from the tolerant leftists despite the entire narrative of the incident being proven false.
"It does put a face to the saying ""million dollar smile"". In all seriousness, the amount of money that settlement is certain to be will go a long way toward securing that young man's future and once the remainder of the lawsuits are settled, we won't hear about him anymore as the MSM will have found someone new to slander and spark faux outrage about."
wont repair the damage of a lifetime of bad press
"Like any other big media, their avid viewers will not care. And public knowledge isn't as long and big as people think in many cases to care about.<br/>
That way they can get this over with and they will move on."
How much you reckon he received?
"$5-10 million and this is just one of multiple, Washington Post is going to be the one to bleed"
What was the settlement?
He was probably already rich seeing as he goes to a private highschool
I go to private school and my family is not rich at all.
Went to a private school (not highschool) for a couple years... Had some issues with bullies because I'm white in what is basically an all Latino town and always reported it and nothing ever happened... So we stopped funding that church and school
Hasn't gotten better from what I hear
"Funny, same situation for elementary except I was Hispanic and the bullies were white. They never did anything so I went to public school for Middle school and now back to high school in private. No bullying anymore, but an ass ton of entitled kids."
I went to one of the most highly rated  private high schools in this entire nation.
We were far from rich.
Just means your parents were smart and put you in private education.
I worked for the organization that ran a private school and a massive amount of the students belonged to either staff/faculty’s family or their parents were working their asses off to give their kids the opportunity they never had. They also gave out scholarships to help less fortunate families afford the tuition. 
"Also, SIMILAR USERNAMES!"
"Hate to break its to you, but attending private school is absolutely not a qualifier for being rich, especially these days when it isn't just about a better education than what public schools offer anymore, and more to prevent activist ""educators"" from indoctrinating young minds with nonsense about choosing their gender and similar things they have no right to do."
I went to a private HS.  My parents weren't rich
I went to a private high school and my parents both worked 2 jobs to make it happen.
my kid is going to a private school. nowhere near rich.
The settlement amount was not made public.
"That's typical when a lawsuit is settled. The defendants don't want anyone else to know how much they caved to so that others aren't encouraged to sue too. Therefore, they usually require a nondisclosure agreement as part of the settlement. Maybe someone inside CNN will leak it though."
Maybe someone inside CNN will leak it though.
That is almost a guarantee
I wouldn't be so sure.  How long was ABC able to spike the Epstein story? And that was already known and imo a much larger story.
"And then when a journalist left ABC, moved to CBS, and broke the story that ABC buried the Epstein scandal for 3 years, ABC was able to convince their competitor to fire her. I guess they don't like whistleblowers so much after all."
Hardly an apples to apples comparison
Right. I'd risk my job to leak the epstein info. I wouldn't risk my job to leak the settlement amount.
<em>Sources close to CNN</em> say it was eleventy billion dollars.
One Brazilion Dollar.
"I need to get some ""dollars"" from Brazil."
that could be fun
"Ah yes, the rare quarter."
No reason for them to release the amount they get since they may still be able to get more from the other outlets
"I'm a bit doubting it. Most likely someone from the kid's side will ""leak"" some big number which they will claim they aren't leaking and it isn't the real number, as a way to leverage the other media companies they are going to sue to settle for a close enough or big enough number.<br/>
Settling first with CNN is good for future lawsuits/settlements."
Stupid question : could somebody find out the number by reading their financial report later ?
"It's not going to be so big as to affect a balance sheet or be discernible. They wont disclose this specific case, and total legal costs for CNN (or AT&amp;T as the top level entity) will be ordinarily high over many suits won, lost or settled - lost in the noise."
"This suit was for $275. If it's just 5% that's a ~$13M settlement, minus lawyer fees. It'd be more than enough to make Sandmann whole, but maybe not enough to really deter CNN from future malfeasance."
"Also, don’t they have insurance that covers this sort of thing?"
Absolutely... any business would have liability insurance that would cover this.
Loss of businesses self insure.
"But they still carry coverage, generally through a subsidiary, and it could still be reinsured"
"With a company as big as CNN, it's more a public image thing. By agreeing to pay a large and unknown sum of money, it's tantamount to publicly admitting they were wrong for what they said because they believed there was a good chance of them losing the case in court. It probably doesn't hurt them financially at all, but the Sandman got a nice payout to make up for the damage to his public image and CNN admitted they were wrong through their action of paying him."
"Even if CNN felt they could win, they likely just compared the cost of defending the lawsuit in court regardless of verdict and found it would be cheaper and easier for the company to just offer a settlement in an amount less than that. It happens in personal injury lawsuits all the time."
I’ve been studying a lot of FRA for the CFA exams and I actually can’t recall how lawsuits would be reported. Can any accountants chime in?
For CNN? Probably under Public Relations
"My roommates a CPA, he said it would probably be in the notes under a contingent liability with a reason stating why, but he’s not positive in this case"
"Contingent Liability would only apply to lawsuits in progress, would they not? Contingent Liability is all about uncertain future events. Or at least I was under the impression that was the case."
That’s more on the lines what he said. He assumed they’d have an estimate of what they thought the settlement would be
"True, but what it will do is set precedent, hopefully making them think twice about doing the same in the future."
Nope. They're too woke for that
"Punitive damage caps have all but ensured you can never get enough out of a large corporation to change their behavior. There’s a reason they’re totally unaccountable. They buy our political process and then convince us that juries (that is, a group of normal people from the community) are insane, cannot be trusted to decide their financial fate, and should have their power to punish bad actors stripped from them. But the only power that’s taken away is the power to punish large corporations. A punitive damages cap of $500,000 could still ruin any of us, but  makes it impossible for a corporation to ever get hit hard enough that they feel it and think twice about doing the same thing."
Highly unlikely. Settlement value on a case like that might reach $1 million if the plaintiff’s attorney has a solid trial record. Might. 
"The number in the complaint is entirely meaningless. Common mistake lay people make: thinking “$300 million lawsuit!” means something about what the case is worth. It doesn’t. Just means you asked the court for that much.  You could write $300 trillion in the complaint if you wanted. Still have to prove damages at trial, and you can’t get to hundreds of millions for public embarrassment. Can’t usually get that much for someone causing you cancer, or paralyzing you, or even killing your child. On the rare occasion a jury actually awards that much (and I do mean rare), the courts always cut it way back. "
"It’s a tactic used by showboat attorneys to make a lawsuit sound like a bigger deal than it is. Fools the media (because they never bother to learn how the civil justice system actually works) and fools the public, but doesn’t fool anyone who actually has to know how these things work. "
"Also, plaintiff’s attorneys want settlement amounts kept confidential sometimes, too, because they’re not much above nuisance value—which is embarrassing after you asked for hundreds of millions."
~$13M
really deter CNN  
For that number? Hehe. No.
I'm sure it's in the millions.
Then where did the figure come from?
The figure in the headline was what CNN was being sued for.
"When an out-of-court settlement is reached, it is always for less than the original amount in the suit."
"It was probably just enough to cover his lawyer fees. It's obvious they wouldn't have been held liable for anything, but settlements are how corporations prevent going through the PR of a full lawsuit."
"Their rate is probably 40% (at most, more likely 33.33) and costs. I highly doubt this suit settled with just enough to cover that."
Not with Lin at the head of that case.
"I admit, I didn't think he was going to get a cent. I'm thrilled that I was wrong."
The fact that he was not a public figure when it happened was where the media hacks really fucked up. NYT v. Sullivan made it so difficult for public figures to successfully sue for defamation that the media has gotten used to being able to lie about anyone they want with impunity. They forgot that doesn't apply to private citizens.
"He was an involuntary public figure, which means the higher libel standard didn’t apply to him."
"One of the outlets he sued (not sure which one) was trying to use the defense that he was a public figure by virtue of them making him one, so they could try and hide behind the actual malice standard. Absolutely ridiculous. If they ever get that defense to stick, they can basically libel anyone unless you can prove they knew they were lying."
"People were significantly underselling the strength of his legal claim. The basic statements in question (that he ""blocked"" nathan Philips and ""wouldn't allow him to retreat"") were demonstrably false when looking at even a tiny bit of larger context. Given how easy it was to find the larger context, the publishing of the statement was at the very least negligent or reckless, and honestly it's possible that the discovery stage would have established actual intent to publish the false statement. The key issue of the case was always going to be whether those statements had a tendency to be harmful reputation, which I also think he had a strong argument for"
"Other suits against WaPo and co are still outstanding, right? "
Hope Nick got a massive payout; his lynching by the media was outrageous. Wish I would say that this case will force news outlets to improve their standards.
Generally if one suit settles it bodes well for the others
Lucky bastard.
I want to be smeared wrongly by the media for smiling.
"The lifelong cost to him is unable to be placed on a monetary scale, the internet is a massive collective database which will never die and he (and his family) will have to face this for the rest of his life. "
"They all would be forced to change their names and go into hiding to avoid connection to this, something which would cost a family millions in lost wages and eternal suffering to avoid detection from. "
"What's the price of ruining someones namesake and forcing the entire family into hiding, they can never be successful because some internet rag will post an article about him in ten years identifying his home and business which will be sucked into cancel culture. "
"Mark my words, this kid will never live a normal life again and when the next ""BuzzFeed"" runs a hit piece on him you better remember the peril of an internet age which records everyone and everything."
"This is true, the lifelong cost of media hounding is beyond measure.  However, I doubt that the media will give him crap for much longer than 5 years or so, and it would be easy for him to ride this out for 5 years and then legally change his name."
"If the payout is large enough, he wont need to worry about lost wages.  If he got - lets say $20million, and is smart with it, he is set for life - (and probably his children and grandchildren's lives as well)"
"EDIT:  I have done some calculations in the past, and I am confident that I personally would be set for life if I can manage to amass $3-5 million in cash.  Working on it, but its not easy.  Maybe I just need to piss off some liberals in public and then sue CNN?"
"You can’t do anything with twenty, Greg. Twenty’s a nightmare."
"You could buy a lot of rental property for $20 million, or maybe some other investment."
He can live very well in KY with a couple million and never need a job. He'll be fine.
Ehhh I dono if it's that bad. Even 5 million is some pretty decent 'fuck you' money where other peoples opinions of you don't matter anymore. With just the smallest amount of smart investing you don't need to worry about shit.
"Eh, this kid may have been well off before and might have all this money now and money does solve a lot of problems, that's certainly nothing to just dismiss."
"However, this kid was enemy #1 for awhile and put on blast by the entire liberal media. There are crazy assholes out there that consider this kid a convenient proxy for their feelings for Trump and probably consider him a bonafide Nazi. Having all that money is nice but he now has to look over his shoulder for the rest of his life. Just about anyone he deals with could be a left-wing nutjob who has been convinced by their political religion that they are morally sanctioned to fuck with this kid and will gladly brag about it. How many places can he go where some fuckhead might make good on the many threats to punch him in his face?"
Furthermore anything he does in the future that could be twisted slightly askance may be pounced upon the media and turned into fodder for the news cycle so they could convince people they were right about him all along. 
"There is an entire swath of society that's been propagandized to hear his name, see his face and think of him as pure evil. That's a hell of a trade off."
"I expect to this day he would still get a random death threat from some idiotic extremist left wing ""warrior"". So I don't think there is that much joy in what is happening to him.<br/>
People went to his house, threaten him and his family. It is not an easy and simple thing to get past."
I suspect anybody that's afraid of being forced to produce Discovery out of their newsrooms and board rooms by a Motion to Compel prior to the presidential election is going to settle out-of-court for 8 figures at this point.
"While these guys are all guilty and likely to get ripped apart in a jury trial, the final amount of that award after 3-4 years with appeals and delays probably isn't what's really got CNN and other networks spooked. No, they are terrified of having to turn over their internal communications regarding their negligent and malicious communications about ""MAGA Kids"" and ""Trumptards"" and various nasty, bigoted comments about Catholics, Christians, white folks, pro-lifers, and Trump voters in general. Not only does it make the corruption in the newsroom radically transparent but it makes what they did deeply personal towards a whole lot of voters."
"Good luck to any newsroom trying to influence the 2020 elections for the DNC, or even drive advertising in your 2020 coverage after Sandmann's lawyers got through with your emails and texts. These outlets are going to put a price-tag on the 2020 election season and see that it's much higher than whatever tens of millions of dollars they need to throw at Nick to make this go away."
"Somebody here PLEASE post this on <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>. I'm sure they'd appreciate it."
"Someone already posted it. The comments are locked now but at least people are calling out the people in <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> for being hateful."

We are all banned there.
"I wasn't banned for years and years. I would post hardcore conservative comments all the time, but refrain from personal attacks and name calling, so I never got banned."
"Finally, they banned me for saying that adult males are men. They called it ""hate speech"" if the person identifies as female."
they banned me for saying that adult males are men
YOU MONSTER!
I was (and am) taken aback. Hate speech? <em>Hate speech?!</em>
"Like, I appealed it, and they flatly said:"
Calling a transgender woman a man -- misgendering her -- is definitely hate speech. 
"I'm like, no, I didn't say anything hateful, or hate driven, or due to hate at all. Also, I didn't ""misgender"" anyone. In fact, I am being told I <em>must</em> misgender someone, or I'm ""hateful"" somehow."
"I don't know why, but this has really hit me to my core. I've been pondering it for months now."
"Hate? Calling a man a ""man"" is ""hate""? It's a technical objective term. It's not a slur. It's not mean. It's not an insult. It's simply me refusing to lie."
Welcome to the New World Order...
I was banned for suggesting that the T should be dropping from LGBT because it doesn't have to do with sexual orientation... It's obviously their soft spot
"<a href=""/r/LGBdroptheT"">r/LGBdroptheT</a>"
"Just identify as ""not banned"" and you can post again."
They literally banned me for posting right wing articles.  Their users mass reported me after I shared something from the daily wire so their mods banned me.
The Daily Wire isn't right wing. It's mainstream Republican.
Did they actually say they banned you for posting a link to that site?
"They claimed it was ""trolling"". But posting those articles was literally my only interaction there. I never commented."
Lol. How did you get banned?
From posting anything logical.
(speaking from experience)
a lot of us are banned from there.  i would love to though!
I can't get a response from wordnews on why i got banned. They said trolling but i legit wasn't trolling lol.
"problem is, to them, disagreement == trolling."
"I was banned from <a href=""/r/news"">r/news</a> for posting facts with statistics on violent crime broken down by race when explaining why certain races have more interactions with police.

"Up next: WaPo, NBC and Gannett (""National Enquirer""). "
"Must have some very good leverage here, for CNN to fold so quickly."
They're going to line up to settle.
"It’s about time, this brings tears to my eyes (the good ones)"
But wait. I was clearly told the media did nothing wrong here. Lol
And that's how it will remain. CNN settled so they can spin this as 'it was cheaper to settle than to fight in court' all the while sticking to their innocence.
CNN really folded up fast. Probably cheaper to take a one time charge instead of go to discovery. I wonder what kind of heinous things might have been found in their emails from when they were smearing those kids.
"Yep, this. They would have paid this kid even if they would have won because they don’t want to risk emails and conversations getting out that would damage their image."
...further.
What's left to damage?
Discovery must have scared the shit out of them.  Maybe some CNN insider might do some reporting and leak it?
Veritas already exposed that
They killed it before it went to discovery because they absolutely do not want it made public exactly how much of a straight-line connection they have with Dem leadership in re: message coordination.
"This was one of the craziest ""stories"" I can remember.  This kid did nothing except for smile.  The left took it as smug, maybe it was, and wanted this kid killed for it.  It was disgusting and I can't believe it was national news for quite some time."
It was a nervous smile. More like an involuntary facial response. I do the same thing sometimes.
"Whatever it was, it didn't deserve the absolute shit storm of threats and insults directed to him.  Was this really only last January?  Feels like it was 3 years ago already.  I guess the left and the media make up so many stories that I've forgotten.  The fact that everyone, even Rogan was kinda shitting on the kid based on the original cut video.  When the whole story came out, I think Americans finally saw how fake CNN was, and if they would make up stories, why wouldn't the other outlets?"
Hope he got enough to make CNN think next time.
Great!
This kid was dragged through the mud...good for him.
Get that Amazon money too. They’re good for it
"Fucking good. And can we shine a light on how perverse those black Israelites are? If you want racism and nationalism, the black Israelites are your group to condemn.  "
CNN totally botched that entire story and tried to ruin some kid’s life to push a narrative. What a bunch of scum bags.
Damn now I wish some asshole would feel threatened by MY smile and MAGA hat. I always wanted a yacht
Would you like to know how to get a yacht? Work harder
"Woof, imagine becoming a millionaire at 16 by taking down CNN. What a hero"
Wonder if CNN will cover this story tonight!
Couldn’t even bear to watch to find out!
hmm. why on earth would you pay someone for something if you did nothing wrong. clearly they did something wrong and implicitly they admit it by paying up.
"That's very bad logic and incorrect, although in this case CNN obviously fucked up massively."
Is that what the tea leaves say though? If they want to stop this before it goes to discovery it means A) they knew a loss(even bigger) was likely or B) they would have uncovered even worse things in discovery
Dems don't just fold
"Read further comments.  I'm not saying CNN isn't obviously pants down guilty in this case,  but the statement that no one ever settles if they're innocent is completely false and irrational.  People settle lawsuits all the time to cut losses and move forward regardless of if they could win a drawn out period of litigation."
"Yea I was thinking that as I was writing it, if the cost to fight it is more than what they're willing to settle then you should just settle. Though CNN isn't above being a bully so it wouldn't surprise me for them to fight it just to preserve what little reputation they have left."
I think the comments above about the discovery becoming public could have contributed.
"Exactly..  Settling is ALWAYS advantageous of you're guilty as all fuck,  it's SOMETIMES advantageous if you're innocent.  We know which one CNN is."
"Plus someone might not have the time and effort to fight something, so settling might be the better option."
Not in this case though...
I'd be very very careful with that line of reasoning.
"Trump and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases (mostly involving <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_injury"" rel=""nofollow"">personal injury</a> claims arising from injuries at Trump properties), with settlements ranging as high as hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump#cite_note-USATodayAnalysis-1"" rel=""nofollow"">[1]</a> and recently as high as tens of millions of dollars."
That's not the way it works... 
"There are many instances where it is better to settle than it is to go to court.  Legal fees add up quick, for one thing."
"Not trying to defend CNN here.  They deserve what they get, but just because a settlement happens, doesn't mean there was wrongdoing."
hmm. why on earth would you pay someone for something if you did nothing wrong. clearly they did something wrong and implicitly they admit it by paying up.
Ask Trump.
BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE...... lawsuits.
The kid is rich.  Lawyers too.   Maybe if this happens more often the rhetoric from the left will be dialed down a bit.
"I wish my smile would make me millions. I love smiling, it's my favorite!"
I won't forget all the people on the right who attacked these students as racist without evidence because they believed defending them would hurt their brand.
"I wish they would have required an on air apology by CNN, but this is good news nonetheless."
Yes but he likely settled for much less than $275 M
I wonder how much he actually got
Anyone know the settlement amount?
Good. Fuck fake news (CNN)
"I hope the lawsuit hit 7 figures. Although CNN is too big to fail and I'm sure this settlement isn't even pocket change for them, it is a breath of fresh air to finally see one of these liberal propaganda machines be forced to have accountability for the release of a libelous hit piece. Hopefully this lawsuit and choice to settle sets a precedent that finally makes the MSM take responsibility for the content they publish/produce."
On to the next!
Nice! He deserves every penny
Does CNN even have 275 million?
Shit Media:
let's disingenuously cover this nonstop for weeks and make millions off the viewer outrage from our blatant lack of journalistic integrity!!
Kid wins millions (probably) against shit media for lying their ass off:
<em>chirp chirp</em>
I wonder if CNN will report this
"Good for him, I was hoping it would go to discovery though."
Better than getting fucked in the arse.
get ittt
"Good for the kid, CNN deserved to lose that money, they could have ruined the reputation of a kid by lying just to push an agenda"
Glad to see Nick's Lawsuit ended up in him winning the Settlement!! ($$$$$$$$$$) Outstanding Job by his Lawyer and team!  Keep checking the win box on the rest of the list you're suing!
Excellent news.
I thought his lawsuit got turned down by a judge. Did they file again for something else?  That's a nice pay day.
No. It was reinstated. Also that was against the Post.
Good for him. Hopefully the payout was hefty as he deserves it for all the hell they put him through.
"I wonder why the list of people he’s suing didn’t include Nathan Phillips, who started it all then lied about it on the news?"
I still don't think this makes up for the lynching he received by them though.
"That list at the end, though. I don't think he'll ever see his day in court against Elizabeth Warren, Ilhan Omar, Kathy Griffin, or Jim Carrey, but it sure would be fun just to see them squirm."
Good for Nick !!!
Bummer there won't be a trail.
They wouldn’t have settled if they thought that they could win.  I’m kind of disappointed that they didn’t take the suit all the way to deal maximum embarrassment to CNN.
"Good on him, but I'm still willing to bet they made more than they settled for."
Finally some good news within all this chaos
Instant millionare.
"Awesome,love it"
CNN has any money left?  Their rating are junk.
Mommy and daddy have some good lawyers
So this kid was a dick and the media responded by being dicks. Everyone sucks here.
"Kid did nothing wrong, my guy."
I'm not familiar with the situation's developments as of late. Could i get a clarification?
This really should be a percentage. 
"It's like a 400 pound man losing 30 pounds, then shitting on a 190 pound man for only losing 10."
Obese people are #1 weight losers!
"Notice the fattest bitch, China, isn't on the board."
Here's a little more context with a focus on the USA.  Looks like a lot of the reductions come from switching away from coal. 
"<a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34872"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34872</a>"
The per capita numbers (this is in Tons/person):
"Population #s from here: <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/"">https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/</a>"
"Per capita percentage, the US is still one of the highest, just prob not #1."
Per capita doesn't really matter in this context. Overall reductions are what matter.
Per capita somewhat matters in terms of how effective measures are because just a person living results in carbon emissions. That means countries with higher populations will naturally have higher total reductions because the measures put in place will likely affect more people. Granted there are a multitude of other factors in place.
Good point.
"Agree, but probably need to factor in GDP somehow. Countries that produce more goods and services will have more carbon production."
"Exactly. This is a real mislead. It is how much relatively you loose, not the amount. Taking drug dealers as an example, you cannot say that if when of the worst drug dealer once stops, let's say, $1mil of $100mil is a ""better person"" than someone going from $1mil to $0,9mil. He still sells $99mil while the other only $0,9mil."
"I disagree. If the objective is to reduce overall CO2 emissions, than that should be measured in the net amount of commissions not a percentage. If I need to save $1 million it doesn’t matter to me about the employee who finds a way to make the company two dollars, I’m way more excited about the girl that makes $250,000 profit for us."
Both should be provided on adjacent graphs.
For anyone wondering the majority of the carbon emission decrease in the US is because since 2005 natural gas has replaced a substantial amount of coal in the power sector.
"Same goes for the UK. We've pretty much eliminated coal and replaced it with CCGT and wind, while expanding gas heating to homes."

"Here are some numbers to go with the chart. For each country the 1st number is 1990, 2nd number is 2005, 3rd is 2017. Figures are Mt CO2/yr."
"US 5085.897, 5971.571, 5107.393"
This shows US emissions slightly up from 1990 while being significantly reduced since 2005.
"Ukraine 783.21, 354.429, 205.723"
"UK 589.038, 561.543, 379.15"
"Brazil 228.603, 380.765, 492.791"
"Canada 455.827, 581.267, 617.301"

"E.U. 4409.339, 4249.995, 3548.345"
Unfortunately the US is world's 2nd highest emissions with 13.77% of world emissions.
"While the US is the world’s second highest emitter, it’s also the world’s largest developed country by population. Also, it’s one of only 4 countries or groups on this list that’s on a downtrend."

That's the sort of thinking I wish more conservatives had. Good on you.
"The EU, UK and Canada are the only ones really comparable to the US in terms of development and both the UK and the EU as a whole are doing far better than the US per capita. Only Canada should really step up, doing both worse and being on an upward trend. There are also only 4 countries on the list that aren't on a downward trend, of which three are developing countries not close to the US in per capita emissions. Greta targets the west simply because it's unreasonable to target India and China where people are climbing out of poverty and have on a per capita base way less emissions."
"That‘s an interesting way to say that the US has the highest usage per capita, and even though it‘s slightly declining, and China‘s usage is rapidly increasing it‘s still nowhere near the US‘ usage."
"Per capita doesn't matter - people only talk per capita as a way to make sure that the US is listed number one. In the end, China is the world's largest polluter, period."

"But I would say its more like there are three very fat people (China, USA, India.. in that order). The fat guy who has the second highest weight (USA) always gets all the heat and gets criticized because everyone hates him"
Why are you dismissing the fact that both China and India have three times the population of the US?  
"You are not comparing ""three guys"". You are comparing populations of hundreds of milllions. The US gets the heat because you have way higher per capita emissions than any of these countries. Yes, some gulf countries have even higher per capita emissions than the US. And fuck them too. Splitting China or India into 3 smaller countries doesn't change their emissions, but each of those countries would be way below the US on the charts. Would that help? It wouldn't."
"That's why the chart you posted in OP is so fucking stupid. Ukraine has population of 42M. The fact the US managed to only do 3x the CO2 reduction they did despite comparing absolute numbers and having 10 times the population should be fucking shameful, not celebratory."
it doesn’t fit the narrative that the US is doing absolutely nothing to lower CO2 emissions.
If that US number is only 0.000001% of total output...then it isn't.
"I'm not saying I know what percentage it actually is, because I don't, but what you're saying if still irrelevant to the comments above."
This chart is EXACTLY why I hate global warming enthusiasts... 
Clearly our capitalist society is helping the problem rather than worsen it.
And if you look for countries that have socialist economies they wont even be on the top 50 list. Truth socialist choose to ignore
they probably don’t produce nearly as much carbon in the first place
Of course they don't produce that much carbon.
"They are more than happy to smugly pass ""green regulations"" on their own non-existent industries since they import all their goods from high carbon producing countries anyway"
The US produces 13x as much carbon as the UK. Percentage reduction is comparatively much lower.
"By ""carbon producing countries"" you mean the US and china, the two biggest economic powerhouses are producing a ton of carbon emissions, there is no proof that a more regulated economy needs a carbon emission heavy country to survive but they do need the US and china to survive so this is not really an arguement, if the US were to regulate more then other regulated countries would not be trading with a carbon emission heavy country."
"I mean, there has been a decent amount of legislation put in place in that 15 year span to curb carbon emissions. The EPA was given keys to the city at some point in that time frame."
"This is also up until 2015, let’s see what’s happened 2015-2020."
Trying to understand. Is it good or bad that it's reduced now?
I think there are key opportunities that’s it’s been reduced as well as places that reduction are detrimental to the economy. 
"Cash for clunkers vs. heavy regulations on the coal industry. If we’re going to hang our hat here at <a href=""/r/con"">r/con</a> on these improvements, like this submission seems to do, them we should consider reductions, or lack there of, in recent years as well. In conjunction with economic considerations"
Great question. A lot of “yeah but” going on here. This is a substantial drop and deserves to be noted.
"It should be noted as a percentage of total emissions. Idk how substantial a reduction it is because the only thing that matters is its proportion to the polluting we do, however great or small that is."
"Found it on the same site that the chart says it is from. Our emissions have gone up every year since 2015. <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/</a>"
Are you looking at figure 1? Says there was a slight decrease in CO2 emission from 2015-2017? 
"Didn’t look at it too intensely, however."
"Yes figure one shows the amount of carbon emissions each rising each year, not decreaseing."
"In 2015 we had -3% emissions
In 2016 we had -2% emissions ... which is 1% more then 2015
In 2017 we had -1% emissions ... which is 1% more then in 2016 and 2% more then 2015.
In 2018 we had +3% emissions ..which is 4% more then in 2017, 5% more then in 2016 and 6% more then in 2015. "
"So yes, our emissions have increased each year. When a chart moves up to the right, it is increasing, even if you start with negative numbers!"
Ahhh I was looking at in in terms of it still being negative emissions in those years regardless of increase. Thanks for clarifying.
Thanks for asking and giving me the opportunity.
"Also, thank you for your reply and taking the time to check out the link! Hope you have a wonderful day!!"
What problem?
"I just wonder why some major oil companies aren’t spearheading research in renewable efficiency in order to have their foot in the door of the market. Not only that, showing results would make for some seriously great PR."
"They have been doing that all along.  Exxon with fuel cells, BP with wind etc.  it’s just that those sources of energy are not profitable."
Is this sarcasm?
I would show this as per capita rather than just pure tons. Right now it could be misleading.
I'm not sure if North Korea decreased theirs own their choice alone
But is this per capita? If we don’t take size of existing production this is meaningless.
"Yeah, she don’t care.  She’s an anti-American tool being abused by the leftists."
All I know about her is her speech to the UN. Has she turned anti-American since then?

The world does not revolve around capitalism vs socialism.
"If she was, she would speak out. Because she is smart. The problem you have is she doesn’t care what you or anyone of us thinks. That drives you crazy. Triggered is the most appropriate term for it. "
I haven’t heard her say anything that would be anti American. Although she is very anti capitalist. And she really doesn’t reference a single nation more often than others.
"It doesn’t drive me crazy. But it does make me tune her out because she has nothing of interest to say.  The biggest contributor of CO2 to the atmosphere is China, yet she says literally nothing to them, because they won’t listen either."
"Because China is a communist nation that will not change its ways because the people have no power. You dont have to ""tune out"" like China, Russia, the middle east and other government controlled nations."
"The world could force China to change.  But, Greta chose the easy, lazy way out.  Castigate the West.  The western media will carry her water for her.  It’s easy.  If she had hit China in front of the UN, maybe some real change would occur."
They (China) have also contributed more monry to green and renewable energy in 3 years than the rest of the world has in last 10
And more CO2.  Kinda convenient you left that part out...
By far.

According to their own assessment.
It's in their very best interest to get off or greatly minimize how much fossil fuel they use for a variety of reasons so I'm going to bet that number isn't an exaggeration on their part.
"They wont actually follow through with any of this until, at the very soonest, they achieve economic and military superiority on the planet.

"Dude we should look at per capita emissions. US is approx 16 units per person, China 8 units per person and India 2 units per person. US has drastically reduced emissions over the past few years yes but the graph in the post is intentionally misleading and has zero credibility."
We should look at per-capita emissions. Its still misleading for you to assume that China and India are somehow more climate conscious than we are
"It shouldn't surprise anyone that China and India have lower CO2 production...their population has historically been too poor to afford meat, imported goods, electronics, personal vehicles, and other conveniences of modern living. Thanks to capitalism however, millions of people are lifted out of poverty every day. So while countries like the US have made tremendous progress in reducing their CO2 emissions, countries like India and China are dramatically ncreasing their CO2 emissions"
I didn’t intend to mean India and China are more climate conscious than the US. I just found this post too shallow and <em>sly</em>
"Agree with almost every single point you made. US has made strides to reduce CO2 emissions while China and India continue to bulldoze through everything in the name of economic development. I still think the West can do even better and shouldn’t stop here (provided it not resulting in an economic slowdown - for example buying electric cars instead of gas powered ones. The money’s still flowing but has shifted, eating plant based meat sometimes instead of beef etc)"
"The sad part is we cannot afford for the whole world to have a lifestyle similar to Americans or the west (eating meat everyday, many gas cars per family etc.) it’s simply too much Carbon for earth to handle. The way I see it is India and China are trying to bring as many people as possible above the water and deliberately ignores effects on environment. So put bluntly (I don’t agree with this but the reason I see why people don’t want to criticize India/China but criticize the West) - it’s easier to point at the West and say eat less beef and take the bus vs pointing at India/China and say don’t come out of poverty."
"Well if you look by country, it would be  330mX16 and 1.35Bx8. ?  So China would be polluting twice as much as the USA?"
"We would do this because you deal with countries,  not individuals"
"No, we shouldn't.  If you're in a room filling with toxic gas, and 1 person is emitting 5 units, and 100 people are emitting 1 unit each, are you going to blame 1 dude emitting 5 for being the bigger polluter? It's the other 100 that are killing everyone."
If they are all in the same room yeah. If 100 people are emitting 1 unit and one dude is emitting 5 units the 100 people are going to tell that dude to emit 1 unit like the rest of them. Because the one dude whose emitting 5 getting mad at the other 100 who are emitting less than him is dumb
And everybody still dies.
"Wait a second...<br/>
This post is misleading. Not sure what the point was, to troll a kid? Is that what being conservative is all about in North America? I don't know about the demographics here, I'm way to old to post memes ridiculing that little girl.  "
"If we're talking about emissions (and I see some have mentioned China as the biggest polluter), obviously we have to look at the CO2 emissions <strong>per capita</strong>, and for the countries mentioned it's (metric tons):<br/>
- USA 16.1<br/>
- Ukraine 4.5<br/>
- UK 5.6<br/>
- Italy 5.8<br/>
...<br/>
- China 8.0  "
"So what is the point of the posted graph, that a child is wrong if she criticize Americans for excessive CO2 emisions, or that the climate change is not real? If it is the first (to be honest, I don't know if she did, I'm not that interested in it), you cannot bring these kinds of graphs. Americans DO produce huge unnecessary amounts of CO2. That's a fact.  "
"It's also a fact that countries with the lowest GDP per capita emit almost no CO2, simply because they have no industry. So it's not like US is the devil here. If you analyse carefully, you will reach a conclusion that a huge amount of CO2 emisions in US is completely unnecessary, and can be avoided, yes.  "
But how is that a topic among conservatives? Is it a conservative opinion that there is no climate change? Or is trolling liberals ALL conservatives are doing these days?  
PS. I'm a centrist living in EU
Facts don't matter.
"You are aware that different countries have different populations, right?"
China didn't show up. They have the largest population. Where are they on this list?
I don’t see Germany on that list. 
"Oh right, their emissions went up after they shut down their nuclear power plants."
"Just because we’re reducing emissions according to this doesn’t mean that climate change is not a problem. Russia, China and India are notably absent here. Also this should be normalized because dealing in absolutes like this fails to give credit to the work done by smaller countries."
"What percentage of climate change is man made, would you say?"
I think the majority of it. We're beyond the historic CO2 limits from ice core samples. I think the human activity is directly correlated to this and I don't think there's a reason to doubt the science of CO2's effect on a planet.
"Even this graph seems mildly misleading, size comparison of these countries is drastically skewed by the size of the US. But I also don't know the real numbers of previous to current emissions"
"Even this graph seems mildly misleading, size comparison of these countries is drastically skewed by the size of the US. "
"There's two countries with much larger populations than the U.S., and half a dozen countries with populations about the same as the U.S., and they aren't on the list <em>at all</em>.   The fact that the U.S. is <em>the only high population country that even makes the list</em> speaks very well for the United States, much better than the fact that it's beating Ukraine or whatever."
What are the numbers for 2015-2019?
"The chart is a bit misleading tho. Usa is much larger than those other countries,  meaning it has a much higher potential for carbon emission reduction. Yes, 400 million is a lot, but something showing the percentage of reduction, rather than just the numbers, would be a lot more infomative and a lot less biased."
It's almost like the U.S. is one of the most ecologically friendly country and that problem isn't us.

How about percentage wise? This is really great news but heat US emissions are more than any country just by sheer size. It honk getting a oerectange of how much carbon emissions was decreased would be more significant

Funny how China and India aren't even on the list.
"it might be good to look at this in conjunction with decrease in carbon emissions per capita as well as decrease in carbon emissions per 1000$ spent (an indicator of actual efficiency, which is what we should aim for)."
Well seeing that the US emits over 5 BILLION metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. I think we really do need to call Greta. She has slot of work to do.
North Korea being on this list is the equivalent of a skinny person bragging about their abs.
lmao ukraine decreased emissions cause half the country was annexed by russia

"""Disinterested"" and ""uninterested"" do not mean the same thing."
e.g. The administration may be <em>uninterested</em> in providing a <em>disinterested</em> forum.
Maybe the UN will get mad and leave NYC
Why isn’t Kerry under arrest?
"What's the point in us being in the UN if we can't choose who gets to address it? If they try to push back over this terrorist, we should leave."
We should leave anyway.  All our money seems to go to is UN troops impregnating 11 year old little girls then leaving.
Candace babe I love you but you’re turning into gossip magazine material do yourself a favor and don’t bother with such petty nonsense
"I disagree Candice is a great person to criticize AOC at every turn. She's young and black, maybe she can get young black people and young woman to stop believing in AOC's lies."
There's a reason she did this. It's because AOC said Trump wasn't allowed to block people on Twitter.
She's just making a point and holding the left to their own standards.
"Yes, i don’t think Candace really cares if AOC blocks her, she is just pointing out the hypocrisy of the Left."
The media only using a 5 year old picture from when he was 12 didn't make that obvious?
Don't forget editing out the shooter's head injuries from where his head was slammed in the sidewalk.
I won't forget how MSNBC edited the audio of the 911 call to make Zimmerman sound like a racist.
And MSNBC dramatically increasing the contrast on his photos to make his skin ultra-white.
It was my first time hearing “white hispanic.”
Yep. That's also when they realized that they could literally steer the country's emotions like a bus on the way to higher ratings.
"These lessons were applied two years later in Ferguson, Missouri, where CNN started a riot by presenting a false story about the cops murdering a nice young man in cold blood."
survey says: probably

"MSM had their narrative and it got views. Nothing was going to change that, even the truth."
"Of course it did,  Trayvon didndu wring."
"Wait, you're telling me that the media didn't tell anyone about Trayvon walking around a neighborhood (where burglaries were taking place), looking in peoples window, shortly before he got shot?"
That's about as likely as the media talking about the stolen jewelry he was caught with at school.
"Yes; you know this because Zimmerman and Martin are/were internationally known names, while Scott and Cervini are/were not. "
"An unarmed teenager shot by a homeowner is an international story IF the ""facts"" can be adjusted to fit the proper narrative. Thus, George Zimmerman becomes ""white,"" and being beaten by an assailant becomes ""just buying Skittles."""
They did
Did they? When DON’T they??
Obviously yes...
Did anyone seriously question this?
Tray tray was a good 'un. He was a RoadsCaller. Why did that white man haf to kill em? It waz wrong.
Trayvon's parents should be held responsible.
"Yes, they most certainly did."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebu6Yvzs4Ls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebu6Yvzs4Ls</a>"
"Yes, because the media isn’t interested in reporting facts.  They want to sell a narrative."
Massad Ayoob had a great write up on this trial in his book Deadly Force. Well worth the read.
"I'm not saying Trayvon was innocent, the whole thing was shady AF but George Zimmerman is a piece of shit human being. Yes the media manipulated public opinion and Zimmerman may have been in the right but that doesn't mean he's a good guy by any means."
Doesn’t change the fact that his killer is a shitty person.
"Obama voter, mentor of black youth, voluntary neighborhood watch on patrol after a large number of recent break-ins, who noticed a 6' shady character sneaking around, alerted authorities, and when he tried to return to his car got jumped and assaulted? Real awful character yeah."
"Remember when the media reported ""Zimmerman involved in road rage incident"" when he was the <strong>victim</strong>?"
When <strong>someone shot into his car</strong>? Yeah.
Didn’t know he was an Obama voter. Holy crap that’s icing on the cake. Mentor of black youth ? The media doesn’t get why they lost our trust ? Ok
How? In what way was he a shitty person?
He initiated the altercation after explicitly being told not to?
"No, trayvon attacked him. He was in his own damn neighborhood, he is more than welcome to ask someone what they're doing there. At the end of the day, Trayvon assaulted him, ended up on top of him and started beating his head into the ground. Trayvon was scum who got shot because he thought he could beat up an older out of shape guy."
"Who gives a shit if it was his neighborhood. I don’t know everyone on my block, nor their family members, and I’d sure as shit expect some kind of confrontation if I was following one of them down the street In my car and then got out to start following them."
"That may make you smarter than Zimmerman in this circumstance, but it certainly doesn't make Zimmerman a horrible person. The only horrible person was Martin, you know, the one who went far beyond confronting someone and assaulted them. That makes Martin even dumber than Zimmerman because if you plan on attacking a stranger you better be prepared to get killed if you aren't certain they don't have a weapon. At least Zimmerman was smart enough to be armed and smart enough to call the police."
"It doesn’t make Martin horrible either. This issue got so polarized that it makes it really hard to look at rationally. Was he the angel the media made him out to be? No. But he also was in a situation where he was visiting relatives and out of nowhere he’s being followed by a strange dude. Some of us would try to talk it out, while others from different circumstances may get more aggressive. The point still stands that Zimmerman was the one who caused the situation to escalate when he got out of the car to pursue Martin. Once he did that, he took responsibility for whatever happened after. His job was to keep an eye out and call in anything suspicious, then let the cops handle it. He wanted to play Johnny detective and it backfired. In any other state he’d be doing at least a few years, and justifiably so in my opinion. "
"He may not have gone into the situation thinking it’d go the way it did, which was silly, and he may not be a terrible person, but the undying defense of the guy for this is absurd to me."
"The point still stands that Zimmerman was the one who caused the situation to escalate when he got out of the car to pursue Martin. Once he did that, he took responsibility for whatever happened after. His job was to keep an eye out and call in anything suspicious, then let the cops handle it. "
"He got out of his car in response to a question by the dispatcher and stated that he started back to his car when the dispatcher told him ""we don't need you to do that"".  "
Note: The dispatcher's comment was not a legal order and Zimmerman was under no legal requirement to obey it.  It is not illegal to follow someone.
"He didn’t get out at their request or in response to anything, he got out because he started to run away and he wanted to keep them updated, to which they replied “you don’t have to do that.”  He also never explicitly stated he went back to the car, he said to look for his truck and/or call him to get his location."
I watched the entire trial. You evidently didn't.  You are wrong. 100%
It doesn’t make Martin horrible either. 
Assaulting someone makes him a horrible person. 
This issue got so polarized that it makes it really hard to look at rationally. Was he the angel the media made him out to be? No. But he also was in a situation where he was visiting relatives and out of nowhere he’s being followed by a strange dude.
Who he assaults.  
"Some of us would try to talk it out, while others from different circumstances may get more aggressive. "
"Or you know, call the police. "
The point still stands that Zimmerman was the one who caused the situation to escalate when he got out of the car to pursue Martin. 
"Nope, it escalated when Martin assaulted Zimmerman. "
"Once he did that, he took responsibility for whatever happened after."
Nope.
"His job was to keep an eye out and call in anything suspicious, then let the cops handle it."
"Who employed him to do that? Oh that's right, nobody. He was a concerned citizen keeping an eye out in his neighborhood and made a dumb mistake that lead to him to having to defend himself with lethal force. He was on public streets, he was on the phone with police l, he wasn't hiding in the shadows stalking someone who felt they were in immediate danger. He was following someone and that person decided to teach him a lesson and ended up buried 6ft under for assaulting someone who had the means to defend themselves. "
"He wanted to play Johnny detective and it backfired. In any other state he’d be doing at least a few years, and justifiably so in my opinion. "
"So he broke no law, was under no obligation to wait for police and did not initiate threats or violence against Martin before he was violently assaulted by Martin. "
"He may not have gone into the situation thinking it’d go the way it did, which was silly, and he may not be a terrible person, but the undying defense of the guy for this is absurd to me."
Your defense of Martin is absurd considering he was the only person that broke the law.
So if you did something dumb and then someone tried to crush your skull because of it you'd be okay with that? You think the punishment for being dumb should be you getting murdered?
"It depends on the dumb thing, but that is a wild oversimplification of what happened. If the dumb thing is following a stranger - inherently someone whose intentions, stability, strength, etc. I don’t know - in my car and then getting out to follow them when they start running, I’d probably look back on it as a poor decision and think “huh should have probably expected the possibility that this would happen.”"
"A 911 call-taker has no legal authority. They have policy. That is what the call-taker used, policy."
There is absolutely no evidence in any way that Zimmerman initiated the altercation.
Zimmerman was driving in his car and saw someone he thought was acting suspiciously. He called 911 and reported and was following the person in his car. The dispatcher was asking various questions during this time.
"At a certain point, the dispatcher asked if the individual was white or black and Zimmerman said he thought he was black. Because of the question, Zimmerman got out of his car and was following the individual to see if he could get a better description. The dispatcher asked if Zimmerman was following him and said that ""We don't need you to do that"" and Zimmerman said OK. He stated that at this point he started on his way back to his truck. There is no reason to believe this isn't the case. Note: Zimmerman was under no legal obligation to go back to his truck. The dispatcher stated under oath that it was not an order and that they don't have legal authority to give that order anyway."
"Zimmerman then said that as he was on his way back to his car, Martin confronted him and after a verbal confrontation started to attack him. All physical evidence and eyewitness testimony supports the story of Martin being on top and banging Zimmerman's head against the ground. The physical evidence also completely supports the story that Zimmerman shot Martin while Martin was on top of him."
"It makes perfect sense that a teenager who was on the phone with a girl and was saying that a ""creepy ass cracker"" was following him would decide to confront the guy."
Do you really believe he initiated it? That’s just not true.
Yes. The police said afterwards that it was avoidable and he should have stayed in his car.  
"The capias states, ""the encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and waited the arrival of law enforcement or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog in an effort to dispel each party's concern.... There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter."""
"By inexplicably - to Trayvon - getting out of his car and following a stranger while talking on the phone about said stranger, instead of being like “hey dude, what are you doing here?” Before calling the cops, or just calling the cops and moving on, he created a situation that ultimately led to the confrontation.  "
"I agree the portrait of Trayvon painted by the media after the event was obnoxious, but he wasn’t - as far as we know - doing anything wrong when Zimmerman followed him and called the cops. I get that there were burglaries going on around the time this happened, but that’s the definition of profiling someone. As someone that is pretty conservative, This is an event that I don’t understand why conservatives so vehemently defend."
The problem is that you're entire argument revolves around the idea that it is ok to violently attack someone that is ensuring you're not doing anything wrong in their neighborhood...because watching someone is initiating violent conflict. If this was the case then all people involved in a neighborhood watch organization are directly responsible if someone assaults them for...being on watch.
"If he didn’t get out of his car when he started running, which is understandable if someone is following you, the whole thing is avoided. He went beyond what was expected of him when he did that."
"If she didn’t wear that dress she wouldn’t have been raped, right?"
"If she didn’t wear that dress, and then start to pursue the guy she already stated to her friends didn’t seem right and listened when they warned her to stop, then yea she probably would not have been raped, if you want to flesh out the analogy a little more."
"You're an entire fucking idiot, it's astounding"
Thanks for the contribution.
No he didnt. Stop spreading lies. 
Martin attacked him and got what he deserved.
Also important to note: the key word here is “was”
Good work boys
Important to note: This dossier was written over a year ago.
"“Mr. Trump, the gambler! […] You are well aware of our power and capabilities in the region. You know how powerful we are in asymmetrical warfare.9 Come, we are waiting for you. We are the real men on the scene, as far as you are concerned. You know that a war would mean the loss of all your capabilities. You may start the war, but we will be the ones to determine its end”"

I feel like comedians are slowly coming out and calling out the left on its bullshit. They’re typically more liberal and still get in their jabs to conservatives (which I’m good with) but now they’re getting persecuted by the left too.
Kind of like what Ben Shapiro said about facts. Comedy doesn't care about your feelings either.
Ever since the large corporations went to the Left.
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't left trying to strip the power from large corporations back to government for example by reducing the power of drug companies to health care?
Exactly what have Democrats done in the past thirty years that had reduced the power of pharma? 
Pharma are some of the Democrats biggest donors
"Well, see, they made it illegal to not have health insurance--wait, that's <strong>really, really good</strong> for massive healthcare companies...."
It's almost like there's a relationship between empowering government and government corruption.
Not with the Selected Conglomerate Corporations.
They want to secure power and limit competition; Just like Socialists
"When a country has proper laws to make sure no mafias or cartells can be born, this won't be an issue - same works in Canada and in most european countries (socialism in those countries is very different when comparing to China). Asia is not a good example of this and they are obviously doing a lot of things wrong."
There's no pharma corruption in Europe?

Yes there is especially in the poor countries where you are able to get a lot of power with money. And your first article pretty much explained the issues in the US
The second article is specifically about the EU
What if I told you all of those countries are poor where you can buy power with money and all of those countries have right or far right leaders
They have right wing governments as a reaction to the bs manipulation caused by left wing power grabs. Figure it out. Is this Obama’s economy too?
It's cute that you think there are countries where power cannot be bought with cash.
"Didn't say there was not, but my point was that these already economically unstable countries are more vulnerable corruption"
Government Healthcare = Rationed Healthcare.
Government paints in broad brushes; private healthcare is specialized to the individual with latest techniques and practices.
I choose private everytime
"Regardless of whether or not you have health insurance or Medicare/Medicaid, if your care provider accepts them then you aren't getting specialized individual care. Hospitals and most private practices in the US prescribe treatments based heavily on what they can bill to insurance and the government. "
"We have the worst system of healthcare funding in the world. As tax payers, we pay more per patient than anywhere else so that parasitic middle men can make a fortune while reducing the quality of care available. That doesn't even consider all of the deductibles and private pay that citizens are forced to shell out on top of all the taxes. The massive mark up on common drugs and medical supplies is also a problem that the rest of the world avoids. I don't want to socialize healthcare, but I do want to see reform."
"Seems the left loves corporate power when it comes to Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Disney..."
Anything that pushes their propaganda.
"I haven't heard of these corporations pushing leftist propaganda, do you have any examples? And how does any leftist want for example Facebook to have more power?"
"Really?  Twitter banning conservatives?  Requiring the correct ""pronouns"", colluding to all simultaneously ban InfoWars?  Hiding conservative content like Prager U?"

The left wants Facebook to have more power as long as it uses it to smear and silence the right.

"At the same time, left-wingers think the right is spreading hate and must be silenced for the good of society."
"Damn, I didn't know the situation was this bad in America."
"Also I see this as companies just trying to stay out of drama and ban people who cause it - which is obviously wrong. Banning people is only a way for them to show that ""we are not part of this and Twitter is not a racist platform"". Is it wrong? Yes. Understandable? Yes also. They just want to make money and have a good image"
Except Twitter is a racist platform.  They allow all kinds of anti-white and anti-semitic content.
"If they were ""anti-drama"", they would ban comparable people on the left, except they don't.  Louis Farrakhan had a blue check mark while calling Jews ""termites"".  He only recently lost that, but still has a Twitter account."
"<a href=""https://unitedwithisrael.org/watch-the-shocking-amount-of-verified-anti-semitism-on-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://unitedwithisrael.org/watch-the-shocking-amount-of-verified-anti-semitism-on-twitter/</a>"
No.  If they wanted to reduce the power of drug companies they would reduce regulations that setup government monopolies and allow significantly more competition into the market.
"Ricky Gervais is not exactly your classic conservative, but did he made the Hollywood paedos squirm"

Stands to reason Kerry would be mouthing off as the Iran nuclear deal was supposed to be his magnum opus. He's still upset that his atrocious deal was tabled in favor of something that actually looks like it might be effective.
I would think that once they threw out his deal that he’d get the message that no one cares what he thinks.

"Cause the fuckers shot it down, that's why. I don't <em>know</em> 100% but I'd put money on it"
If there was nothing to hide than there's no reason not to turn over the blackbox.
"There was a source in Arabic on Twitter from an earlier thread very early this morning (~4 am EST)  that said it was shot down by a trigger-happy SAM site, suspecting it was a low-flying bomber trying to avoid radar."
"They know they shot it down, we know they shot it down, everyone knows they shot it down. There’s a reason Iranian officials said the cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction” only 20 minutes after the crash."
"Color me shocked. Let's see what the world does about this. I'll put my money on nothing/almost nothing. I saw there were a bunch of Canadians and some Europeans on board, let's see what those countries do about it. Probably not much"
"Canadian here, you can bet we've already begun writing a pretty strongly worded letter that, I think, will really make them think twice about doing this again."
Problem solved.
Just try not to apologize
Iran shot it down.
"Who to trust, the Ukrainians or the Iranians? Surely neither would have reason to be corrupt. Tis a true conundrum."
"It worked out for Iran, too. Had there been American casualties there would have been a deadly response. They avoided that, while saving face at home by being able to say they did something."
It was damage control mode that they were pushed into.
"I have to say, absolutely perfectly played"
Holy shit. Will Biden abandon his campaign office in PA now?

Wtf..... she was trying to defend her daughter from a pervert.  No stranger can do that to my kids!! I would probably do the same thing this mother did
Nothing but admiration for her
"It was Biden, wasn't it?"
"Not even trying to hide what they're doing to subvert a fair election, eh?"
This is why the electoral college still exists.
"The NY system is wide open to fraud already. In addition to not requiring proof of citizenship to register, there is no verification of identity at the polls. No  photo ID of any kind is required and at most the voter must give name, birth date and address. Gender, phone number, email are not required pieces of data."
This will just make the fraud more robust.
May...?  MAY???  Get the fuck outta here we all know that may is a definite yes to empower these people.
Subversives in charge.
"Biden will literally say whatever he thinks will go over best for him in the news, at any given time. He has no real stance on any issue whatsoever, almost anything he says you can find a clip of him saying the opposite in years past."
"I feel like Biden's response to this is going to seal the nomination for him.  Yes, he's a flip-flopping hack, but people expect that from their politicians.  ""Flip-flopping hack"" is a better response than Elizabeth Warren's ""He's a terrorist, no wait he's an official, erm wait well he's a member of a group that's been designated . . ."" or Sanders' obvious Corbynist affinity for jihadists."

You sound like you're apart of the California government too.
The first recorded major Australian wildfires from drought were in 1851. the extreme drought cycle (and the accompanying mega wildfires) seems to happen about every 27+/1 years since then. From wikipedia:
"Intense bushfires are not uncommon in southern Australia. The region is  one of the three most fire-prone in the world. Within the last two  hundred years, the area has experienced and documented at least <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushfires_in_Australia"">twenty-five major fires</a>, beginning with Black Thursday in 1851."
SOMETHING STINKS !!! #AusPol #BushfireEmergency #ArsonEmergency #AustraliaUnderAttack
​
Fuel load + cyclical drought + 200+ ARSONISTS is the cause

"congratulations to them, they may have singlehandedly killed the koala population (their population has dropped to the thousands, and some experts at an Australian zoo I went to are saying that there isn't enough genetic diversity for a sustained population going forward)."

Iran trying to act tough yet being so fucking scared is hilarious.
They’re used to acting tough working.
HOLY SHIT THEY HAVE TIME TRAVEL MISSILES!!!!!!
Kim Jong Un frantically trying to discover Iran's secrets like Plankton trying to steal Mr. Krabs' Krabby Patty recipe
And people were <em>ackshully</em> worried about the saber rattling from Iran.
well they do have time traveling missiles
Kinda reminds me of the caged children pictures that Trumps policies abused...in 2014
Or the attack on Syria from a Kentucky gun show
They’re not too bright.
They did this shit with the shoot down of the GlobalHawk as well...putting forth a picture of a shot down drone over Yemen from a couple years prior to try to make it look like it was over Iran and not international waters. It goes to show how fucking stupid these people are thinking it will go unnoticed...or ironically how smart they are due to the fact that the orange man bad and MSM crowd will eat it up and disperse before a fact check occurs.
TIL Iran uses internet explorer
No sh!t. I'm shocked.

HE JUST FUCKING STRAIGHT-UP CALLED OUT OBAMA FOR SPONSORING IRANIAN TERRORISM.
This is gonna get interesting.
yeah he did 
"and he is right, man Trump is on the next level of awesome."
Calm.  Decisive. Straightforward and on message.  He projects command and control.
That’s a great point he made. The missiles that Iran used were more than likely funded by Obama. And the only reason we the American people know that is because Obama got caught.
can't wait for the left brigade to come forth and cry some more.
They never stopped.
"I'm still waiting for their pre-approved talking points to hit yet. They seem to be confused on how to deal with there not being a WW3, deescalation, and the threat of peace."
Wow I’ve never seen a UK Trump supporter nice to know they have smart people there.
"like the main media persuasion you would think that we all are lefty crybabies, there are a good few of us who are in with Trump. you hear it quite often on talk radio or LBC ( another talking point show) and from listening today many people back the strike as he has the blood of british soliders on his hands as well. "
"I applaud Trump and the armed forces for their precisision strike with no civilian casulaties. it was a clean decisive message he delivered basically saying we aint taking no more of your shit. Much like the democrats, labour (who are the same side of the political coin) are sympathetic to Irans cause, so much so that our leader of the opposition was paid to go on Iranian TV. "
unfornatually boris is in a bad way with our recent impending brexit deal on the table with both EU first and have to appear on 'friendly terms' but I firmly believe he is on US side.
"This situation really couldn't have gone better for Trump. This is a massive success for his foreign policy model. We got to take out one of the world's leading terrorists in exchange for a zero-casualty missile attack and more sanctions on Iran, plus we now have a legitimate avenue for peace. "
All those morons crying about WW3 and the draft can sit down and be quiet from here on out.
although I do applaud some of the draft meme's they have been rather funny. Trump 2020 is looking even stronger

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled to congressional Democrats late Tuesday that she plans to continue to hold on to articles of impeachment against President Trump 
I thought President Trump was an “imminent threat” to our republic Nancy?  Isn’t that why you had to do your “solemn” duty on a day you “didn’t come to Washington to see” or something like that?
"It's funny she's holding onto something Mitch doesn't want. Like ok grandma, keep your papers we totally don't want you to send our way!"
"McConnell: You have no power here, witch."
Obstruction of the senate
Imagine this happening if we had a media that was even remotely on the level. There would be questions.
"The House does not get to dictate to the senate how the trial is done. The House gets to make up their own rules, which they did. Now the senate gets to make their own rules. "
"Pelosi is obstructing justice by attempting to hold the senate hostage until they give her what she wants, so she can try to save face on this whole impeachment fiasco."
She probably has them framed and hanging on her wall at home
What the hell you would think they will grow smart
Has a House speaker ever demanded the trial plan from the Senate before submitting their articles of impeachment of a President before?
This is the Congressional equivalent of telling someone that you have to tell them something but they need to promise not to get mad first.
"Okay, Nancy."

"Now someone paste McConnells face on Bane, Nancy on the CEO, and Chuck on the dude making a late bolt out the door."
Oh man...  if I knew anything about f/x / deep fakes / video production...  I'd almost take a course to make that video.
Lol - they should just release this document to Nancy:
"<a href=""https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf</a> "
"I think the House is trying to limit what the Senate will do as part of their trial.  Particularly Article XI from their existing Senate Impeachment rules: Which specifies the formation of Trial Committees.  These would be groups of Senators that have the ability to get additional evidence and testimony from whomever they see fit for the trial (and then report on it of course).  Actions of such committees would then lead to summoning specific individuals and compelling their testimony during trial.  Of course, this would include the myriad of witnesses that the House intentionally excluded from their hearings via their special rules.  (e.g. the whistleblower, etc.)"
"Interestingly, this specific power (Article XI) was brought into question during the Nixon impeachment hearing, but the Supreme Court upheld it specifically, confirming the Senate has this right during its trial proceedings."
I could see the Senate spending time in committees investigating all the Burisma connections and the like... wherever it leads.
"I expect the House will finally submit their articles to the Senate just prior to the next election... such that the committees the Senate forms will not have enough time to really get into their investigations to gather info for the trial (and none of that info could then possibly leak out to the public), but the timing will allow House Democrats to claim they're moving forward and continue their political narrative (which they believe will help them in the elections)."
"The house dems are so tricky with all this shit.  Their cleverness in getting all these investigations going and even articles of impeachment knows no bounds.  Now, the reach of their cleverness is trying to rig a senate trial to their liking much like the Adam Schiff soviet style show trial.  I can't wait to see more of their cleverness.  They are definitely winning the affection of voters with all of this stuff."
I thought the Senate already figured out how to proceed here.  I don't know if they voted or not but I could have sworn they said they would be using the same rules set up during the Clinton impeachment.
"I know they still haven't received the letters, but they've been pretty clear for a while now how things will run when they do get them."
"Apparently Iran informed Iran and Finland immediately prior to the latest ""attack."" This was effectively warning us also which resulted in minimal damage/casualties. Iran was able to save face and we can now calm everything down."
I am very pleased it seems that Iran got the message that we won't be toyed with while not escalating this into absolute chaos. That is a fine line to walk and it seems Trump along with our top military advisers have navigated us into a much better position.
If we are no longer beholden to that region for energy and powerful in our enemies eyes we will no longer be so easily manipulated in the future.
Iran informed itself and a nordic country before the attack  cool
Water is wet
Fire. Hot.

Air. Air?

THEY ARE YUUUUUUUUUUGE!
Now there is a leftist conundrum.....
“Nuclear taboo”
"The people who think solar and wind are the solution have hated nuclear, despite the fact it’s always been more stable, cleaner, and cheaper.  It’s often absent from alt power discussion."
"Most people I would think, just want the light to come on when they flick a switch.  Having less junk in the air is a benefit, but when it comes to the bill at the end of the month, practical solutions always win."
"Oh, yeah. I recall the left's stock response to the massacre: ""I'm not saying the Charlie Hebdo staff deserved to be slaughtered, <strong>but-</strong>"""
There is only one current world religion that feels a drawing of their pedo deity justifies death/killing. 
Islam is the absolute weakest and most fragile religious belief to ever exist. Leave it? Death. Criticize it? Death. 
"They simply can’t deal with dissent, so they kill dissent off using direct teachings of the religion."
"Bonus: Islam is the only religion that doesn’t blanket statement denounce murder. Instead, Islamic texts specify it is immoral to kill <em>”innocents”</em> — conveniently leaving the decision of who is and isn’t “innocent” up to the reader/interpreter. "
So killing someone for leaving Islam isn’t viewed as murder... because they have decided that it’s only bad if you kill an innocent person... and the person they killed was conveniently labeled “not innocent” by those who murdered them... because they <em>say</em> so. 
"Same for any violence against groups. Gays? Well, they aren’t “innocent”. So it’s not bad to persecute then and throw them off buildings. Woman gets raped? Shoot, she’s no longer “innocent”, so killing her is totally OK because she’s a cheater! "
The logic of Islam is about as backwards as can possibly be imagined.
"""Muslim fragility"""
That case has never left my heart... those brave cartoonists never deserved such a tragedy and I hope their assassins rot in hell.
It sucks because recently in French class there was a Hebdo artist who did a comic strip for our textbook and my teacher mentioned that was one of the people killed. The thing with that magazine was everyone got attacked. Left and right. Right more often but the left got hit too.
wHy WAs CoNgReSs NoT iNfOrMeD?!?!??!?!
"""They picked bases that are really big, where you can hit the base without hitting anyone,"" Michael Pregent, a former intelligence officer who studies the Middle East at the Hudson Institute, told the Washington Examiner. ""Talking to people inside government, they're saying that they think that this was a 'save face' gesture by Iran because they picked big bases and they're using missiles that were accurate enough not to hit something."""
...
"Kroenig also noted that a salvo of slightly more than a dozen missiles is relatively small, considering Iran's large stockpile."
"""So, my read is that this was their attempt at a 'Goldilocks' type strike to show that they were striking back without provoking a major war with the United States,"" he said."
It's going to be pretty damned funny watching Trump taunt Rictus Nancy and her fellow quislings in the House during the State of the Union address next month.  Must-see TV.
I am liking this tweet compare series
"lol i know! and what about <a href=""/r/trumpcriticizestrump"" rel=""nofollow"">this tweet compare series</a>?"
Some of those are pretty funny
That sub is not funny. They are mocking Trump.
"Thank you.  We must never allow jokes or light hearted comments about Trump, and should always show disapproval of people who do that.  I'm glad others recognize."
Agreed. This sub is a 24/7 rally and we must cast out all those who oppose him. Dissent must be crushed so that the Trump agenda can thrive.
"That's some heavy shit to accidentally forget your /s, bud"
They arent mocking Trump. Trump is mocking himself and they're just laughing about it. Huge difference
"So? This sub mocks Obama pretty hard, and he was also a president. Don’t dish it out if you can’t handle it being served back your way."
"huh, not even pretending to veil the propagandistic cult worship. "
consider how wrong it is to assume anything mocking trump automatically means unfunny. 
and then consider the irony that the only submissions allowed in that sub are uneditorialized tweets from trump himself. therefore he is mocking himself. 
so consider getting upset at him if something in that sub has you salty.
"Why are you posting this here? Post this in <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> where it will be met with rage comments and a plethora of downvotes."

Congress has already been asserting itself all over the place without anyone’s consent
"For decades.  Years.  Passing laws, rules, regulations that never end. They say that by electing them the people gave consent. It is next to impossible to get rid of bad congressmen."
These assholes think we’re stupid.
You are stupid. These tweets are comparing the killing of member of al qaeda to the killing of an Iranian general. Dont ya think one of those is a little worse?
Just because your terrorist organization calls you a general and not a cleric or a something else doesn’t take you off the battlefield.
The guy was a terrorist.
Have you no idea what he's done?
He thinks we're too stupid to understand the difference between a state actor and non-state actor. You are proving his point.
"Both are terrorists, asshat. Call them what you want, but you’re the dummy here."
"No, I don’t. Both  are legit terror organizations."
"Strange, it’s almost like there is a massive difference between the two that this entire sub is willfully ignoring"
It’s a political sub. Willful ignorance is required to be given that designation.
"Example: <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>"
I live how they say it is for discussion of all politics but if you post a single thing conservative you get banned. Real open-minded they are.
What’s different?
Orange man bad.
All eight of the people who downvoted just made me realize that eight people are more retarded than your typical communist
Obama's drone strike policy was good at killing kids before they could grow up to become terrorists.
Someone should post this to a sub about tweets that didnt age well. Probably exists lol
Oh there definitely is but you'd be downvoted to hell and back
OrAnGe MaN bAd!1 
Even when he does good
Why are we comparing al qaeda to Iranian generals? One is a rogue terrorist group and the other is directly linked to a sovereign nation who has powerful allies in Russia and China. Killing a rogue leader did not set off a world war but this has the potential to.
"No, it doesn't.  And this guy was just a terrorist with a uniform."
It's much harder for a terrorist organization to wage a meaningful war against us than Iran. Iran can hit Israel and other US bases in the area much harder than a terrorist org.
"Also, we were already in a conflict with al-Qaeda in 2012. We aren't currently at war with Iran."
We have been dealing with Iranian backed terrorists for four decades.
"That's fair, but we haven't been in direct military conflict with Iran. I'm not saying we shouldn't have done anything at all, I just question if the decision was well thought out or if it was seizing an opportunity, consequences be damned. Iran has been funding terrorism for far too long"
"Do you know anything about the Iranian Air Force? The best they can field is an F-14, and the backbone of their force? F-5 Freedom Fighters. Their Air Force belongs in a museum. We would have complete Air Dominance and then the Army could do whatever they wanted. It would be 1991: Electric Boogaloo. I refuse to be scared by a country whose army is mostly to suppress their own people. Heck the tactics they used in the Iran-Iraq war were from 1917. Do not buy into the fear mongering."
"We have been in proxy fights with Iran since 1980.  We backed Iraq in their war with Iran, funded and supplied Saddam.  They hit us via their network of affiliated and sponsored terrorist organizations.  They've been behind hundreds of the attacks on US forces in Iraq over the last fifteen years, they've intercepted and harassed our ships in the Gulf, and a ton of other things.  "
"They are not dumb enough to directly confront us, even now.  Our response in taking out the general was measured, and they responded in a measured way.  As far as I can tell this should be over, and we'll be back to our usual tense relationship when the media furor dies down."
"The US is the one who first funded Al Qaeda, so its really a US fault"
"We never funded Al Qaeda. We funded the mudjahedeen against the Soviets, and some of them became part of Al Qaeda years later."
What do you call quds? Are you so uninformed that you believe soleimani wasn’t a terrorist? Maybe this will show that we don’t care what your title is if you’re a terrorist we’ll treat you like one
Is it possible for someone to be a terrorist and also be a high ranking member of a sovereign government that is heavily backed by Russia and China? I think probably yes.
"Is ""well they were both terrorists"" the most honest understanding of Schumer's position?"
Is it possible that Schumer approves of drone striking terrorists but not of drone stricking terrorists who also happen to be high ranking member's of sovereign nations which are heavily backed by Russia and China?
"oh ok, well you convinced me. "
At first I thought a terrorist responsible for killing hundreds of Americans and planning to kill more should be a pretty high priority target.
"But now that you brought up that he had allies within China and Russia, we should have just let him go about his business. "
/s
Do you even realize what you're saying?
the fact that they’re both terrorists or neither terrorists is irrelevant. it’s the fact that they attacked the united states.
"It literally is relevant. One is a top military official of a country, the other is a terrorist."
"We were already engaging al-Qaeda in 2012, we were not engaging Iran until the killing of their leader."
"if putin attacked a us embassy and trump did nothing, the ONLY FUCKING THING you’d see is that he did nothing because he’s a treasonous russia asset ect ect. shut the fuck up"
You guys are impossible to deal with sometimes. Just admit it. This situation deserves a tactful approach. Iran is a much more dire situatuon than guy's in caves with bombs. They have legitimate allies. They have a legitimate military and a national following.
This is a situation akin to WW1. Incompetent leaders with their fingers on the triggers and a mish mash pf allies and enemies that could end up bringing unnecessary violence and destruction to the world. 
"Be conservative, quit being trigger happy"
"It's not even remotely close to being akin to WWI. That comparison is simply absurd. Iran is not tied to every country in the region and a number of super powers by mutual assistance pacts and the like.  They have done the bare minimum to placate their people by responding to this attack, and this is likely the end of it."
Let us hope so. I just see it having the makings. With russia possibly backing the Iranians end the long game as well as a possible Chinese interference. (Obviously not set in stone) could bring more heat to the fire. As well as us destabilizing our relationships with Europe (wether it needed to happen or not) could put us in a hot spot we don't want to be in. 
Add that to the fact that our allies in the Middle East are just as terrible as Iran themselves (Saudi Arabia) and the danger this could put on our ally Israel. 
Obviously only time can tell but during this time I believe de-escalation should come before preemptive strikes. Which both sides are commiting to.
Have you noticed that the Russians have said absolutely nothing about this whole thing?
Very true. I agree with you that hopefully the escalating os done for and everything else will ve done through proxies as usual. (Which still sucks) But it would be silly (in my opinion) to not believe tvis can gwt out of hand
"Dude. No one is going to fuck with NATO, especially Iran. Their military is a joke. "
The west is really good at absolutely curb stomping uniformed enemies.
I'm not saying Trump should have done nothing. It's not like the assassination was his only option for retaliation.
"The Putin hypothetical is meaningless and irrelevant. Russia didn't attack our embassy, Iran did. Other people bitching about Russia doesn't negate what we're saying about Iran right now."
Schumer is a hypocrite
Keep it up chuckles...
"""another endless war"" Who got us into the first one? Who got us out of it?"
Our aggressive Middle East policy got us into the war over the past sixty years so it's not really a specific person.
Bush and no one.
Schumer is a terrorist sympathizer and an enemy of the American people and should be treated as such.

apples to oranges
But you can still compare them.
"""Hahah look at this idiot, he said he LIKED apples in 2012 but now in 2019 he HATES oranges hahaha what an idiot"""
these two are a lot more comparable that the viral trump video saying in 2013 that obama would start a war so he’d get re-elected. this time war is actually necessary. time to take action against iranian abuse directed at the united states
"Right so, Trump pulled out the nuclear deal of Iran, then sanctioned them over and over and then when he gave them an opportunity to negotiate, he goes around and kills the top commander while he was on his way to talk to the Iraqi PM to get shit sorted out. "
"I'm no Iran fan, but I'm pretty sure Trump is the one in the wrong on this one. He went too far, and now lives are at stakes because of his baby tendencies"
"I'd say this general getting hit was justified based off his running of Iran's IED program alone, but I think any further escalation on Trump's part might cost him my measly vote.  Trump's anti-war position was what attracted me the most in the last race, and him  flipping on that would be a bridge too far."
"Right so, Trump pulled out the nuclear deal of Iran"
...because they'd been violating it since before the ink was dry.
...then sanctioned them over and over...
"...because they continued to violate it, threaten the US and its allies, attack civilian shipping, and foment terrorism against the US and other countries."
"...and then when he gave them an opportunity to negotiate, he goes around and kills the top commander..."
"The negotiation offer was from Saudi Arabia, not the US - and the top commander was the top commander of Quds Force whose mission is to arm and train terrorists and execute terrorist attacks world wide, was personally responsible for over 600 US casualties, and was behind recent terrorist attacks against US forces and sites."
"I'm no Iran fan, but I'm pretty sure Trump is the one in the wrong on this one. "
Nope.  ...and the reality is that Iran needs a really hard smack after the missile launches and militia attacks tonight.
"I don't expect the Ukraine is pleased about Iran shooting down their airliner, either."
way to replace “waste of money” with “iran deal” and “attack on us embassy” with “opportunity to negotiate”. it’s clear which side your on
"U aint makinh any sense????? Even if the deal is a waste of money, it is still a deal. And the opportunity to negotiate was before the attack on a Iraqi base that had american soldiers."
it’s clear your hatred of trump has an effect on the way you reason. if he withdraws from a bad deal he’s in the wrong because it’s “still a deal”? i think “u ain’t makinh any sense” bitch
Al Qaeda =\= QUDS.
Chuck Schumer is politically identical to Nancy Pelosi in that everything he says and does is done cynically and in bad faith.
"Even assuming these are comperable, are you actually saying that someone would not be able to change their opinion after 7 years?"
"Don't ask him, he suffers from convenient two facedness"
And we're still at war with that country 8 years later
"You have to understand, selectively targeting prominent figures who sponsor, train, and support terrorist militia factions throughout the Middle East is an effective strategy to tackle the source of the problem without going into an all-out war. What’s different this time is orange man bad."
One is a terrorist and the other is a military general
"We were already at war with Al Qaeda, we were not at war with Iran when we killed Suleimani"
Iran has been committing literal acts of war against us for 40 years now.
Go on
"That wasn't the first US embassy they attacked, you know."
"They didn't attack the embassy, Hezbollah did, with their funding but nonetheless"
"""They didn't do it, they paid someone else to""? Seriously?  How is that any better?"
I mean of that's the metric then we attacked them first.
Are you claiming that the US has spent the past few decades funding and training a terrorist organization that's dedicated to the destruction of Iran and its allies?
Yes
Yes
Oooh. Fine sources. Spend a few hours finding primary sources for all those citations?
"Trolling, trolling, over the bounding main...."
"we werent at war because we put up with the drone destruction, taker attacks and American hostages. we should’ve been at war for these acts against our country on the first place. what trump did is 100% justified"
The amended AUMF we have limits military actions the govt. can take against Iran. It would be nice if Trump can expand those powers so we can take meaningful actions against Iran.
We somehow managed to not end the world after the Soviets put nukes in Cuba but this is gonna do it?
You are not very bright person.
Fuck dude you got me with that ad hominem
Um... you got some reading to do.
Al queda are a terrorist organisation. Iran are a sovereign nation. These are totally different things. Are you ignorant or stupid?
"iran attacked oil tankers, american drones and held 52 american soldiers hostage in the past 9 months alone. i think your ignorant AND stupid"
"Whilst both were terrorist, the iranian general was connected with the iranian government, thus dragging us through a war that for some reason some dont want"
Dragging us through a war??  What will change. Will Iran “start” trying to attack our interests abroad because of this? Lol
The US also has diplomatic means of dealing with other sovereign nations. Comparing Iran to Al-Qaeda is blatantly missing the point. Assassinating top generals of other countries prevents war how?
"It certainly prevents attacks that he was planning, which was the point."
"Yes, he was the only one with the ""attack plans"". No one will ever replace him. Operation Kicking the Hornet's Nest accomplished!"
"It's amusing watching you guys contort yourselves around this. If he wasn't a big enough deal that his death isn't going to disrupt Iran's terrorist attack planning, then he certainly isn't a big enough deal to start World War III."
Assassinating a country's top official is not enough to start a world war? Ever heard of a guy called Franz Ferdinand?
This ain't 1914.
"I don't think the current year is relevant. Committing an act of war against someone has always increased the likelyhood of a war happening. This is not ""contorted logic"", it's incredibly straight forward. To some degree, war never changes."
"You can quote Fallout all you want, but if you're actually trying to draw a parallel between this guy and Ferdinand, it's going to fail on a whole boatload of levels, which is why I said this isn't 1914. "
There is almost no chance this is going to turn into World War III.
"I agree that the World War 3 is not a likely outcome. Although, at the time they would have said the same in regards to Ferdinand. Regardless, this was a bad move that will only escalate tensions and violence in an already unstable region."
You can quote Fallout
...
"I never said prevents, i insisted that it starts war"
less illegal immigrants to vote for them
How dare he change his opinion in only 7 years
It's the one that doesn't start a war.
"Apparently Iran informed Iran and Finland immediately prior to the latest ""attack."" This was effectively warning us also which resulted in minimal damage/casualties. Iran was able to save face and we can now calm everything down."
I am very pleased it seems that Iran got the message that we won't be toyed with while not escalating this into absolute chaos. That is a fine line to walk and it seems Trump along with our top military advisers have navigated us into a much better position.
If we are no longer beholden to that region for energy and powerful in our enemies eyes we will no longer be so easily manipulated in the future.
Iran informed itself and a nordic country before the attack  cool
Water is wet
Fire. Hot.
Trump. President.
Air. Air?
They aren't big.
​
THEY ARE YUUUUUUUUUUGE!
Now there is a leftist conundrum.....
“Nuclear taboo”
"The people who think solar and wind are the solution have hated nuclear, despite the fact it’s always been more stable, cleaner, and cheaper.  It’s often absent from alt power discussion."
"Most people I would think, just want the light to come on when they flick a switch.  Having less junk in the air is a benefit, but when it comes to the bill at the end of the month, practical solutions always win."
"Oh, yeah. I recall the left's stock response to the massacre: ""I'm not saying the Charlie Hebdo staff deserved to be slaughtered, <strong>but-</strong>"""
There is only one current world religion that feels a drawing of their pedo deity justifies death/killing. 
Islam is the absolute weakest and most fragile religious belief to ever exist. Leave it? Death. Criticize it? Death. 
"They simply can’t deal with dissent, so they kill dissent off using direct teachings of the religion."
"Bonus: Islam is the only religion that doesn’t blanket statement denounce murder. Instead, Islamic texts specify it is immoral to kill <em>”innocents”</em> — conveniently leaving the decision of who is and isn’t “innocent” up to the reader/interpreter. "
So killing someone for leaving Islam isn’t viewed as murder... because they have decided that it’s only bad if you kill an innocent person... and the person they killed was conveniently labeled “not innocent” by those who murdered them... because they <em>say</em> so. 
"Same for any violence against groups. Gays? Well, they aren’t “innocent”. So it’s not bad to persecute then and throw them off buildings. Woman gets raped? Shoot, she’s no longer “innocent”, so killing her is totally OK because she’s a cheater! "
The logic of Islam is about as backwards as can possibly be imagined.
"""Muslim fragility"""
That case has never left my heart... those brave cartoonists never deserved such a tragedy and I hope their assassins rot in hell.
It sucks because recently in French class there was a Hebdo artist who did a comic strip for our textbook and my teacher mentioned that was one of the people killed. The thing with that magazine was everyone got attacked. Left and right. Right more often but the left got hit too.
wHy WAs CoNgReSs NoT iNfOrMeD?!?!??!?!
"""They picked bases that are really big, where you can hit the base without hitting anyone,"" Michael Pregent, a former intelligence officer who studies the Middle East at the Hudson Institute, told the Washington Examiner. ""Talking to people inside government, they're saying that they think that this was a 'save face' gesture by Iran because they picked big bases and they're using missiles that were accurate enough not to hit something."""
...
"Kroenig also noted that a salvo of slightly more than a dozen missiles is relatively small, considering Iran's large stockpile."
"""So, my read is that this was their attempt at a 'Goldilocks' type strike to show that they were striking back without provoking a major war with the United States,"" he said."
It's going to be pretty damned funny watching Trump taunt Rictus Nancy and her fellow quislings in the House during the State of the Union address next month.  Must-see TV.
I am liking this tweet compare series
"lol i know! and what about <a href=""/r/trumpcriticizestrump"" rel=""nofollow"">this tweet compare series</a>?"
Some of those are pretty funny
That sub is not funny. They are mocking Trump.
"Thank you.  We must never allow jokes or light hearted comments about Trump, and should always show disapproval of people who do that.  I'm glad others recognize."
Agreed. This sub is a 24/7 rally and we must cast out all those who oppose him. Dissent must be crushed so that the Trump agenda can thrive.
"That's some heavy shit to accidentally forget your /s, bud"
They arent mocking Trump. Trump is mocking himself and they're just laughing about it. Huge difference
"So? This sub mocks Obama pretty hard, and he was also a president. Don’t dish it out if you can’t handle it being served back your way."
"huh, not even pretending to veil the propagandistic cult worship. "
consider how wrong it is to assume anything mocking trump automatically means unfunny. 
and then consider the irony that the only submissions allowed in that sub are uneditorialized tweets from trump himself. therefore he is mocking himself. 
so consider getting upset at him if something in that sub has you salty.
"Why are you posting this here? Post this in <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> where it will be met with rage comments and a plethora of downvotes."
"i’m banned from <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> for sharing my opinion"
Congress has already been asserting itself all over the place without anyone’s consent
"For decades.  Years.  Passing laws, rules, regulations that never end. They say that by electing them the people gave consent. It is next to impossible to get rid of bad congressmen."
These assholes think we’re stupid.
You are stupid. These tweets are comparing the killing of member of al qaeda to the killing of an Iranian general. Dont ya think one of those is a little worse?
Just because your terrorist organization calls you a general and not a cleric or a something else doesn’t take you off the battlefield.
The guy was a terrorist.
Have you no idea what he's done?
He thinks we're too stupid to understand the difference between a state actor and non-state actor. You are proving his point.
"Both are terrorists, asshat. Call them what you want, but you’re the dummy here."
"No, I don’t. Both  are legit terror organizations."
"Strange, it’s almost like there is a massive difference between the two that this entire sub is willfully ignoring"
It’s a political sub. Willful ignorance is required to be given that designation.
"Example: <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>"
I live how they say it is for discussion of all politics but if you post a single thing conservative you get banned. Real open-minded they are.
What’s different?
Orange man bad.
All eight of the people who downvoted just made me realize that eight people are more retarded than your typical communist
Obama's drone strike policy was good at killing kids before they could grow up to become terrorists.
Someone should post this to a sub about tweets that didnt age well. Probably exists lol
Oh there definitely is but you'd be downvoted to hell and back
OrAnGe MaN bAd!1 
Even when he does good
Why are we comparing al qaeda to Iranian generals? One is a rogue terrorist group and the other is directly linked to a sovereign nation who has powerful allies in Russia and China. Killing a rogue leader did not set off a world war but this has the potential to.
"No, it doesn't.  And this guy was just a terrorist with a uniform."
It's much harder for a terrorist organization to wage a meaningful war against us than Iran. Iran can hit Israel and other US bases in the area much harder than a terrorist org.
"Also, we were already in a conflict with al-Qaeda in 2012. We aren't currently at war with Iran."
We have been dealing with Iranian backed terrorists for four decades.
"That's fair, but we haven't been in direct military conflict with Iran. I'm not saying we shouldn't have done anything at all, I just question if the decision was well thought out or if it was seizing an opportunity, consequences be damned. Iran has been funding terrorism for far too long"
"Do you know anything about the Iranian Air Force? The best they can field is an F-14, and the backbone of their force? F-5 Freedom Fighters. Their Air Force belongs in a museum. We would have complete Air Dominance and then the Army could do whatever they wanted. It would be 1991: Electric Boogaloo. I refuse to be scared by a country whose army is mostly to suppress their own people. Heck the tactics they used in the Iran-Iraq war were from 1917. Do not buy into the fear mongering."
"We have been in proxy fights with Iran since 1980.  We backed Iraq in their war with Iran, funded and supplied Saddam.  They hit us via their network of affiliated and sponsored terrorist organizations.  They've been behind hundreds of the attacks on US forces in Iraq over the last fifteen years, they've intercepted and harassed our ships in the Gulf, and a ton of other things.  "
"They are not dumb enough to directly confront us, even now.  Our response in taking out the general was measured, and they responded in a measured way.  As far as I can tell this should be over, and we'll be back to our usual tense relationship when the media furor dies down."
"The US is the one who first funded Al Qaeda, so its really a US fault"
"We never funded Al Qaeda. We funded the mudjahedeen against the Soviets, and some of them became part of Al Qaeda years later."
What do you call quds? Are you so uninformed that you believe soleimani wasn’t a terrorist? Maybe this will show that we don’t care what your title is if you’re a terrorist we’ll treat you like one
Is it possible for someone to be a terrorist and also be a high ranking member of a sovereign government that is heavily backed by Russia and China? I think probably yes.
"Is ""well they were both terrorists"" the most honest understanding of Schumer's position?"
Is it possible that Schumer approves of drone striking terrorists but not of drone stricking terrorists who also happen to be high ranking member's of sovereign nations which are heavily backed by Russia and China?
"oh ok, well you convinced me. "
At first I thought a terrorist responsible for killing hundreds of Americans and planning to kill more should be a pretty high priority target.
"But now that you brought up that he had allies within China and Russia, we should have just let him go about his business. "
/s
Do you even realize what you're saying?
the fact that they’re both terrorists or neither terrorists is irrelevant. it’s the fact that they attacked the united states.
"It literally is relevant. One is a top military official of a country, the other is a terrorist."
"We were already engaging al-Qaeda in 2012, we were not engaging Iran until the killing of their leader."
"if putin attacked a us embassy and trump did nothing, the ONLY FUCKING THING you’d see is that he did nothing because he’s a treasonous russia asset ect ect. shut the fuck up"
You guys are impossible to deal with sometimes. Just admit it. This situation deserves a tactful approach. Iran is a much more dire situatuon than guy's in caves with bombs. They have legitimate allies. They have a legitimate military and a national following.
This is a situation akin to WW1. Incompetent leaders with their fingers on the triggers and a mish mash pf allies and enemies that could end up bringing unnecessary violence and destruction to the world. 
"Be conservative, quit being trigger happy"
"It's not even remotely close to being akin to WWI. That comparison is simply absurd. Iran is not tied to every country in the region and a number of super powers by mutual assistance pacts and the like.  They have done the bare minimum to placate their people by responding to this attack, and this is likely the end of it."
Let us hope so. I just see it having the makings. With russia possibly backing the Iranians end the long game as well as a possible Chinese interference. (Obviously not set in stone) could bring more heat to the fire. As well as us destabilizing our relationships with Europe (wether it needed to happen or not) could put us in a hot spot we don't want to be in. 
Add that to the fact that our allies in the Middle East are just as terrible as Iran themselves (Saudi Arabia) and the danger this could put on our ally Israel. 
Obviously only time can tell but during this time I believe de-escalation should come before preemptive strikes. Which both sides are commiting to.
Have you noticed that the Russians have said absolutely nothing about this whole thing?
Very true. I agree with you that hopefully the escalating os done for and everything else will ve done through proxies as usual. (Which still sucks) But it would be silly (in my opinion) to not believe tvis can gwt out of hand
"Dude. No one is going to fuck with NATO, especially Iran. Their military is a joke. "
The west is really good at absolutely curb stomping uniformed enemies.
I'm not saying Trump should have done nothing. It's not like the assassination was his only option for retaliation.
"The Putin hypothetical is meaningless and irrelevant. Russia didn't attack our embassy, Iran did. Other people bitching about Russia doesn't negate what we're saying about Iran right now."
Schumer is a hypocrite
Keep it up chuckles...
"""another endless war"" Who got us into the first one? Who got us out of it?"
Our aggressive Middle East policy got us into the war over the past sixty years so it's not really a specific person.
Bush and no one.
Schumer is a terrorist sympathizer and an enemy of the American people and should be treated as such.
[removed]
apples to oranges
But you can still compare them.
"""Hahah look at this idiot, he said he LIKED apples in 2012 but now in 2019 he HATES oranges hahaha what an idiot"""
these two are a lot more comparable that the viral trump video saying in 2013 that obama would start a war so he’d get re-elected. this time war is actually necessary. time to take action against iranian abuse directed at the united states
"Right so, Trump pulled out the nuclear deal of Iran, then sanctioned them over and over and then when he gave them an opportunity to negotiate, he goes around and kills the top commander while he was on his way to talk to the Iraqi PM to get shit sorted out. "
"I'm no Iran fan, but I'm pretty sure Trump is the one in the wrong on this one. He went too far, and now lives are at stakes because of his baby tendencies"
"I'd say this general getting hit was justified based off his running of Iran's IED program alone, but I think any further escalation on Trump's part might cost him my measly vote.  Trump's anti-war position was what attracted me the most in the last race, and him  flipping on that would be a bridge too far."
"Right so, Trump pulled out the nuclear deal of Iran"
...because they'd been violating it since before the ink was dry.
...then sanctioned them over and over...
"...because they continued to violate it, threaten the US and its allies, attack civilian shipping, and foment terrorism against the US and other countries."
"...and then when he gave them an opportunity to negotiate, he goes around and kills the top commander..."
"The negotiation offer was from Saudi Arabia, not the US - and the top commander was the top commander of Quds Force whose mission is to arm and train terrorists and execute terrorist attacks world wide, was personally responsible for over 600 US casualties, and was behind recent terrorist attacks against US forces and sites."
"I'm no Iran fan, but I'm pretty sure Trump is the one in the wrong on this one. "
Nope.  ...and the reality is that Iran needs a really hard smack after the missile launches and militia attacks tonight.
"I don't expect the Ukraine is pleased about Iran shooting down their airliner, either."
way to replace “waste of money” with “iran deal” and “attack on us embassy” with “opportunity to negotiate”. it’s clear which side your on
"U aint makinh any sense????? Even if the deal is a waste of money, it is still a deal. And the opportunity to negotiate was before the attack on a Iraqi base that had american soldiers."
it’s clear your hatred of trump has an effect on the way you reason. if he withdraws from a bad deal he’s in the wrong because it’s “still a deal”? i think “u ain’t makinh any sense” bitch
Al Qaeda =\= QUDS.
Chuck Schumer is politically identical to Nancy Pelosi in that everything he says and does is done cynically and in bad faith.
"Even assuming these are comperable, are you actually saying that someone would not be able to change their opinion after 7 years?"
"Don't ask him, he suffers from convenient two facedness"
And we're still at war with that country 8 years later
"You have to understand, selectively targeting prominent figures who sponsor, train, and support terrorist militia factions throughout the Middle East is an effective strategy to tackle the source of the problem without going into an all-out war. What’s different this time is orange man bad."
One is a terrorist and the other is a military general
"We were already at war with Al Qaeda, we were not at war with Iran when we killed Suleimani"
Iran has been committing literal acts of war against us for 40 years now.
Go on
"That wasn't the first US embassy they attacked, you know."
"They didn't attack the embassy, Hezbollah did, with their funding but nonetheless"
"""They didn't do it, they paid someone else to""? Seriously?  How is that any better?"
I mean of that's the metric then we attacked them first.
Are you claiming that the US has spent the past few decades funding and training a terrorist organization that's dedicated to the destruction of Iran and its allies?
Yes
Yes
Oooh. Fine sources. Spend a few hours finding primary sources for all those citations?
"Trolling, trolling, over the bounding main...."
"we werent at war because we put up with the drone destruction, taker attacks and American hostages. we should’ve been at war for these acts against our country on the first place. what trump did is 100% justified"
The amended AUMF we have limits military actions the govt. can take against Iran. It would be nice if Trump can expand those powers so we can take meaningful actions against Iran.
We somehow managed to not end the world after the Soviets put nukes in Cuba but this is gonna do it?
You are not very bright person.
Fuck dude you got me with that ad hominem
Um... you got some reading to do.
Al queda are a terrorist organisation. Iran are a sovereign nation. These are totally different things. Are you ignorant or stupid?
"iran attacked oil tankers, american drones and held 52 american soldiers hostage in the past 9 months alone. i think your ignorant AND stupid"
"Whilst both were terrorist, the iranian general was connected with the iranian government, thus dragging us through a war that for some reason some dont want"
Dragging us through a war??  What will change. Will Iran “start” trying to attack our interests abroad because of this? Lol
The US also has diplomatic means of dealing with other sovereign nations. Comparing Iran to Al-Qaeda is blatantly missing the point. Assassinating top generals of other countries prevents war how?
"It certainly prevents attacks that he was planning, which was the point."
"Yes, he was the only one with the ""attack plans"". No one will ever replace him. Operation Kicking the Hornet's Nest accomplished!"
"It's amusing watching you guys contort yourselves around this. If he wasn't a big enough deal that his death isn't going to disrupt Iran's terrorist attack planning, then he certainly isn't a big enough deal to start World War III."
Assassinating a country's top official is not enough to start a world war? Ever heard of a guy called Franz Ferdinand?
This ain't 1914.
"I don't think the current year is relevant. Committing an act of war against someone has always increased the likelyhood of a war happening. This is not ""contorted logic"", it's incredibly straight forward. To some degree, war never changes."
"You can quote Fallout all you want, but if you're actually trying to draw a parallel between this guy and Ferdinand, it's going to fail on a whole boatload of levels, which is why I said this isn't 1914. "
There is almost no chance this is going to turn into World War III.
"I agree that the World War 3 is not a likely outcome. Although, at the time they would have said the same in regards to Ferdinand. Regardless, this was a bad move that will only escalate tensions and violence in an already unstable region."
You can quote Fallout

Countdown to demands for Iranian forces to leave the country in 5... 4... ... ... oh who the fuck am I kidding. They won't do that shit to their paymasters.
The acting Iraqi PM was forced to resign from his official post in November for being in Iran's pocket
Funny how the media neglected to mention that when he said US forces need to leave
"The interview with the president was a really good one. I wasn’t able to catch all of it, but the last 20 minutes or so were stellar."
He really fucking has. And this latest Iranian BS proves it further.
From other sources:
"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned what he called Iran’s “reckless and dangerous” missile attacks on bases in Iraq used by U.S. troops, and he called for “urgent de-escalation” by Tehran and Washington."
"Johnson also said Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander killed in a U.S. airstrike last week, “had the blood of British troops on his hands.”"
...
"NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg in a tweet on Wednesday condemned the missile attacks on Iraqi bases housing US troops and called on Iran to ""refrain from further violence""."
"""I condemn the Iranian missile attacks on US &amp; @coalition forces in Iraq. #NATO calls on Iran to refrain from further violence."""
...
"German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said her country ""rejects this aggression in the sharpest possible terms""."
"She told German public broadcaster ARD that ""it's now particularly up to the Iranians not to engage in further escalation""."
The New York Times and the Washington Post are new versions of Pravda and Izvestia on our own soil.  What pride the quisling editors and staffers must have in their “Bad America” work.
are new versions
Don't assume it's new. Walter Duranty of the NYT won the Pulizter for his denial of Holdomor.
Great point.  Duranty also called Stalin’s purge show-trials fair and necessary.
"And as always, because they are so self-righteous, whenever they get criticized it just emboldens them and they end up doubling down in their nonsense."
Elitists and narcissists consider criticism proof positive of their superiority!
And these ass clowns object to when we call them the enemy of the people.
At this point are they just doing it to stay relevant? Are we biting on the bait here?
Warrior-philosopher...austere religious scholar...pretty glowing terms for terrorists. Wonder if trump will ever get a descriptor like that from these rags? /s
"Mentally-ill Mega satan, or something to that effect. God forbid we ever mention the positives the guy has."
"My how the mighty has fallen. New York Times, wtf happened to you."
What is US media just a propaganda machine for Iran now?
"The other day my dad refused to call him a terrorist because it is, as he put it “dehumanizing”."
"Your dad is a giant pussy, sorry"
"Cool it dude. My dad and I disagree politically, but he sure as hell isn’t a pussy."
Always remember this going forward. Remember who supported the murderers.
"New York Times is a trash rag, tabloid, pseudo- news."

"no, they sent 15 missiles, hit nothing, and then stood down. It was a symbolic ""retaliation"" that saved face for their theocratic regime among their population. IF Trump retaliated after there was no loss of american life he would have looked insane. He played it right IMO."
Exactly. He knew that they knew they were beat already. I also appreciated his talking to the Iranian people about wanting them to prosper and have peace.
"LOL
No only that but blames Obama. So basically it isnt Iran's fault it is an Americans fault. 
No 52 sights destroyed. Nothing but more talk."
I am anti war but the propaganda around this is so stupid. In Conservative world right now Dems are &gt;= Iranians.
in Dem world right now Dems = Iranians.
Corbyn should be stripped of his UK citizenship if he hates the UK so much.

Oh wait! Here is another piece!!
Thank goodness UK voters overwhelmingly rejected tragic grampa
So she/dims have now set precedence for administrations to follow:
What assholes
"This is what power hungry traitors do. Use politics to convince voters that the laws set before them are evil because of who may be able to wield them that they don’t favor. If this was Hillary doing all this, there be nonstop media coverage about how amazing she is doing. It’s pretty disgusting that we have politicians pounding their chests about how they care about the constitution and our laws. But at the same time, violate and try to distant them. They are hypocrites and need to be purged from our government."
In fairness a completely dysfunctional government serves our interests a lot more than it serves hers.
"True, I'm fine with these precedence so long as R legislators hold D executives to the same standards."
Pelosi wants to limit the commander in chiefs war powers ...
"I know I'm repeating my material, but:  "
"President Obama did not require Congress's approval to launch attacks in Libya, nor does he need congressional authorization to keep U.S. forces there, the top House Democrat said Thursday."
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the White House violated neither the Constitution nor the War Powers Resolution when it launched military operations in the war-torn African nation in March without Congress's endorsement.
She isn’t making any progress. Pelosi is dismantling the Democrat party one idiotic move after the other. She thinks she has people fooled. She has some. But the majority see right thru her. She is a senile old bag protecting her investments.
Pelosi is dismantling the Democrat party one idiotic move after the other.   
I actually think she's trying to save the old Democratic Party from the Islammunist radicals who are trying to hijack it.
"If that were true, she wouldn’t be bending to the pressure they put on her and compelling her to move forward with these shams. Pelosi is not a cure to the socialist radicals on the LEFT. She is just another disease working along side them."
"I think she's trying to bend but not break.  As long as she's Speaker she can put the brakes on the radical leftward shift.  If she gets tossed out, Speaker Tlaib will take a scimitar to the brake lines."
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the White House violated neither the Constitution nor the War Powers Resolution when it launched military operations in the war-torn African nation in March without Congress's endorsement.
"Rules for thee, not for me&lt; Old leftist saying."
"Pelosi should find a new job, like changing bed pans at veterans homes."
"She is a leftist bureaucrat. She will never leave power. Just look at Bernie, he is about to die with his terrible health, was supposedly going to retire, and he is still here clinging to power.   "
"I think bad of all career politicians, but leftist career politicians have a special place for hate in my heart. They are the ones spewing the help the poor bullshit, and then are some of the richest people on the world."
I wish I had 10% of Bernie's Wealth.
I wonder if the Dem voters will keep voting her and her cohorts back into office. Liberals are the dumbest voters on the planet. So not much faith in them making the right choice.
I wonder if the Dem voters will keep voting her and her cohorts back into office.
I already made a similar question in a Democrat reddit.
The answer I received from pretty much everyone could be resumed to '' Even if the republican candidate it's better I will still vote for Democrats ''
"So yes, they will keep voting her. Democrats have abandoned any kind of bipartidism or common sense they had."
I propose that Republicans also take the same measure ( minus common sense )  and NEVER vote democrat.

"After the execution, and the common days of mourning, I expected Iran to answer, but frankly, I didn't expect much.  What we got is about what I figured.

Now that's an Iranian Funeral!
"It's like the Iranians heard the Dothraki wedding quote and said ""hold my beer""."
Imagine how many Iranians are going to die in the funeral they hold for the 80 iranian civilians killed in the plane they just shot down.
Thanks. 🤦‍♂️
And 1500+ killed in a demonstration in December.
"So, has Iran provided the black box yet of this downed flight?  Heard earlier this morning that they were holding back."
They're refusing to hand it over to the US.

"It’s normal not to give the black box to Boeing though, I believe according to the international law it is their duty to keep it and conduct an investigation"
"Having said that, anyone with IQ higher than room temperature already knows that Iran is guilty, so even if they don’t give the black box it doesn’t really matter"
"Having said that, anyone with IQ higher than room temperature already knows that Iran is guilty, so even if they don’t give the black box it doesn’t really matter"
Haha have you read CNN?
"No, I prefer not to waste my time like that. Anything else other than them defending Ayatollah?"
"At the moment (this morning) my concern was with Iran utilizing and sharing the black box recordings with the affected countries whose citizens perished in the crash, and/or the country the flight was headed to.  Looking at an article mid-day on this topic, they will be including the Ukraine in the investigation (makes sense to me)."
"I've no experience in the process of plane crash investigations, so please bear with me as I ask this.  Is Iran's noting ""no, we will not give the black box to America and Boeing"" an okay response in a general sense?"
"According to Fox News and other media outlets it is an okay thing to do simply because boeing is a private entity, whereas this investigation should be conducted by the states that were involved. "
"The issue here is that while I recognize that these investigations take a long time, it is alarming that the Iranian government has not made a statement regarding these black boxes (as of this moment, or perhaps I might have missed it). If it refuses to co-operate with Ukraine and Canada, then it is absolutely a sign that says ""we're guilty but you can't do anything""."
"I promise you the black box is in 1,000 pieces right now. Really, the only hope to get to the truth is for some video to surface."
"It is nothing short of a miracle that an American wasn't on this flight. I mean yea, it really sucks that an airplane was more likely than not shot down by a squirrely missile operator and a lot of people died,but goddamn that mistake could've triggered an escalation at the least desirable moment"
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting restraint."
"Was not expecting the repeated ""we want Iran to be happy"" pieces.  Every political speech is just a series of sound bites any more, wonder who he's expecting those to be played by/directed towards."
It sounded like he was actually talking to the people of Iran. IDK why.

What democratic is defending him?
"No Democrat is defending this guy. They just don't want to be dragged into yet ANOTHER decade of pointless war that costs the US lives in another shithole country. This subreddit keeps spinning it like anyone is defending the character of Sol; not at all. It's was just a stupid move for the U.S. to escalate it so quickly that we now would have zero support from any countries for any conflict with Iran... which is nothing like Iraq or Afghanistan because they actually have a military. But, you know, easy for armchair generals here to pretend they would actually ever fight over there."
This post is fake as shit and just meant to anger conservatives here against liberals who aren't even saying this shit.
"Didn't the NYT literally run a piece paying homage to Solemani, calling him a warrior philosopher? Didn't the Washington Post label Soleimani a national war hero who should be revered and suggest that this was an totally uncalled for attack of US aggression? Do you not see the liberal media downplaying just how evil of a person Soleimani really is? Do you not see their somber coverage of his funeral and how they expressed no issues with the chants of the Iranian people saying ""Death to America""? Do you not see all the blue check markson Twitter saying they'd rather stand with the Iranians and that they're ashamed to be Americans? Do you live under a fucking rock?"
"The NYT article where the second line of the first paragraph is ""He was behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel?"" Did you even read any of these articles or are you just repeating things you've read in certain subreddits?"
"I get that it seems like the liberals are downplaying how evil he is... but they're not. They want to emphasize that the manner in which he was taken out was horribly executed and how much we don't want another vapid war in the middle east. It's really that simple. Going as far to say any person of any party in the United States would go as far to say this guy was a charming lad is fake news. Probably bots stirring the pot. Maybe before you accuse me of living under a rock... should verify the things you're accusing. Especially if you're going to reference newspaper articles that I am not quite sure you have actually read. No offense. I am assuming that is why you immediately dove into this ad hominem version of debate; because the points are evidence less. Nothing more than attempts to stir the pot with things no one is actually saying, and using that anger to fuel your own positions."
"Please provide evidence of the NYT article paying homage, the WP labeling him a war hero to anyone but the Iranians that supported him, and 'liberal media' downplaying how evil he is. The rest of it too if you want, but a lot of it sounds like just emotional charging rather than substance. Also, if your only news outlet is FOX news and this subreddit... I am afraid our argument will nothing but devolve into back and forth nothingness. Relying on only those two for information is analogous to the people who chant ""death to America"" because they've been getting all their facts from one news source. We're better than that."
Bruh what are you talking bout
"Democrats: deny everything until someone tells you your wrong, with facts and proof. Then deny some more. Shameful, really. Agree with you 100%."
Yes this right here. We should be treating the situation with facts and hopefully get more info from the white house about the imminent threat to support this move further. 
Spinning this random narrative about Democrats supporting a terrorist not only doesn't work but more importantly makes it look like the strike doesn't have a real narrative in the first place.
Your first time on reddit?
No one is defending him. The problem is this could be catalytic in a balkanised area.
Please. We set that powder keg off 17 years ago when Bush shoved us into Iraq.
"Iraq and Iran are very different countries, and Iraq never had a strategic alliance with Russia."
"Just to be clear: I don't think anyone who is informed thinks that Soleimani was a good guy. He was our enemy and that is pretty clear. The discussion is over whether or not we should have killed him. Sure, he quite frankly deserved what he got, but killing him made our relationship with Iran very unstable. There won't be a war, but it will screw up any future relations with Iran."
Right.  There are thousands of people worse than Soleimani that the US hasn’t assassinated because of the politics and diplomacy surrounding it.  No one is defending him as a person.  They’re just criticizing the decision to sabotage our diplomatic relationship with another Middle Eastern power.
"There won’t be any relations with Iran anyway until the terrorists are out of power. Unless you’re referring to appeasements that previous administrations have used, we haven’t really had any relationship with them at all.  Soleimani was a terrible person and there’s a reason he was in Iraq while our embassy was being attacked and burned. He is responsible for many American deaths and he got caught finally. This should have happened long ago, so no, there should not be a question about whether or not we should have killed him."
"According to the Iraqi PM, the reason that he was in Iraq was because the US asked him to invite Soleimani to Iraq in order to mediate the dispute."
LOL.. are you referring to the Iraqi PM who had to resign last year due to the ongoing anti-government protests because he was too cozy with Iran?? This is the guy who is providing the rationale for why the Iranian general was there? K.
"I am referring to the current Iraqi PM. While this is speculation on my end, since you said the person you are referring to resigned, I would imagine that it could not be the same person."
It is the same person. He resigned and has not been replaced yet. He was the one who made the statement.
"I see plenty of you dipshits sucking him off all over this godforsaken sight.  Go look at <a href=""/r/worldnews"" rel=""nofollow"">r/worldnews</a> right now and tell me they aren't calling him a good guy."
"Can you link some? I honestly couldn't see any, at least in the rated comments."

Misspelling words is lame."
"I don't think any one is saying he's a good guy, I'm worried he might be the 21st century's Archduke Ferdinand and soon nukes will be flying, and who gives a damn about abortion and gay marriage then?"
Pfffft
Do you honestly believe there is even a .0001% chance nukes will fly over this? You are aware that nukes have not been used in combat since the first two atomic bombs dropped on Japan right?
"Not anymore, but no one thought WWI would be started over one assassination."
WWI wasn't between one insignificant military power and the world's only superpower so...
"Iran is backed by Russia and China, if it really comes down to it, though, aren't they?"
"Lmao,  no..  Russia and China both benefit from Iran,  but they are not stepping in to fight the U.S. over them.  And again,  Russia is no longer a superpower, they cannot project military power much farther than the Middle East and their own borders except for with ICBMs, which they are not stupid enough to use.  We are China's biggest trading partner, largest debtor, and source of all their stolen technology.  China needs us a lot more then they need Iran.  No one has anything to gain by going to war with us, this is a far different scenario than those leading up to the world wars. Seriously,  we're talking about a single drone strike here,  everyone is being incredibly dramatic."

"Once you all have found a war with a clear goal, end date, and a casus belli that justifies our retaliation, you'll know where to find me."
In my opinion the best way to help wounded veterans is to stop making them.

"Once you all have found a war with a clear goal, end date, and a casus belli that justifies our retaliation, you'll know where to find me."
No war in human history has met your criteria.
So we should pull the fuck out before we lose more troops and innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.
Not even Trump’s top advisors thought provoking Iran by assassinating Soleimani was a good idea. Conservatives need to get their heads out of their asses.
I came here because someone in a news thread said you guys are all calling for war it's pretty much true but there's a good many of y'all with your head on straight we can be friends after all lol
How do they want you to pay for college lol by taxing wallstreet ?
The current DNC is more pro-war than Repubs except for a handful of RINOs. 
"Both sides want affordable healthcare and college, Democrats just think throwing even more money at the problem will fix it and Repubs don't."
"How do you solve a high-demand good or service being extremely expensive without manually lowering its cost or offering it for free? This is why public housing, food stamps, scholarships, etc. exist. "
"Conservatives love to greatly overestimate how rich Americans are, like millions aren’t in crippling debt because they were unfortunate enough to be sick, or because they wanted to pursue an education that would allow them to have more financial success."
offering it for free
"No such thing. Free college means the taxpayers pay the schools instead of the students, just like we do for existing public education. Which is great if you're a prospective student, and sucks ass if you took out loans, paid them off diligently and then turn around and have to pay for everybody else, too."
"Making it free is just going to increase the demand for it, which not only drives up the cost, it also devalues a bachelor's degree (which is already happening as we speak)."
"Then why can’t we do it, but European countries such as Sweden, Norway, France, Finland, Denmark, and Germany—all countries with much lower GDP’s than the US—can?"
"Sounds more like Americans have an ideological barrier that prevents them from wanting to contribute taxpayer money for the public good in any way that they see is a handout, because they believe that almost nobody is entitled to anything, even major life necessities. And college is shaping up to be a necessity, as it has already been in many aspects of the competitive workforce."
This is not a lesson in economics; it is a lesson in empathy.
"Then why can’t we do it, but European countries such as Sweden, Norway, France, Finland, Denmark, and Germany—all countries with much lower GDP’s than the US—can?"
"Their taxes are much higher than ours. That's how. Oh, and they don't have nearly the defense spending because they all rely on our military."
"Sounds more like Americans have an ideological barrier that prevents them from wanting to contribute taxpayer money for the public good in any way that they see is a handout, because they believe that almost nobody is entitled to anything, even major life necessities. "
"Nobody is entitled to anything. I don't know when that got twisted, but it would be a good lesson for some folks to learn."
"Besides, we do have safety nets for necessities. If you go to a hospital, you will be treated. We have Medicare and Social Security for the elderly, Medicaid, WIC, SNAP and a whole host of other programs for the poor. We have grants and scholarships for education plus government-backed loans which, if used responsibly for a marketable skill at an affordable institution, are completely reasonable. The list goes on. Note that all of these could and should be improved, but Universal Free Everything is stupid and not feasible."
"And college is shaping up to be a necessity, as it has already been in many aspects of the competitive workforce."
"That's been a gripe of mine for a long time. You don't need a degree to most jobs. If you spent 4 years apprenticing instead of in school you'd be way further ahead. Bachelor's degrees have become so common that companies ask for them to do jobs that didn't require it 20 years ago, simply because they can. Stop flooding the market with them and companies will stop requiring them when they realize they can't fill data entry jobs with CS degrees anymore."
This is not a lesson in economics; it is a lesson in empathy.
The answer is somewhere in the middle. You have to have both. Empathy is something we should all have but we're dealing in a reality of finite resources. You can't just ignore economics.
"They have higher taxes across the board; however, we have a much higher level of income inequality, which can remedied if tax rates on the 1% returned to those of the New Deal era, and if tax loopholes were closed. Also, they do not have ratios of defense spending to net GDP comparable to the US because they do not embrace interventionism in the first place.  "
"Those public services exist but are not enough to be able to guarantee that the average American will not go into debt over them. A thousand-dollar ambulance trip is a ridiculous price to pay, and tuition exceeding federal loan limits by $11,000+ on average is a disgrace. "
"How can we not be entitled to anything but still have safety nets set up by the government? It is obvious that the medical and education health industries have no interest in decreasing their services’ costs on their own. Conservatives speak passionately about pragmatism with spending, but fail to realize how distortedly the market can price its goods. As a result, Americans must come to embrace spending more money pro bono so that there is no need to accuse others of leeching off the government’s money. If the money exists to make it happen, why not make it so?"
"There's a line on your 1090 where you can make additional payment to the government. I'm curious to see how often you've utilized it, given how freely you are willing to make everybody else do it."
"Ah, so this <em>is</em> a lesson in empathy. "
"If my tax dollars were re-appropriated to go more toward socialized health care and college system, I would happily pay those taxes. If your children were in medical or educational debt, I'm sure you'd think the same thing. If not, well--it's your right to be selectively altruistic, since we are entitled to do in our lives as we please."
"That said, taxing the working class significantly for these projects is not necessary. While nominal increases in taxes per capita may come about, they'd be compensated for by fewer expenses in health care premiums and tuition costs.

This argument fails because it's not being spent on the things people are calling for higher taxes on.
Free college will not be paid by tax payers unless they are working trading in wall street . You are mis informed
Is there actually any evidence Soleimani had a hand in 9/11? 
That seems very odd for an Shia Iranian to help Sunni Saudis but stranger things have happened.
"Here’s the thing: Solemeini was a garbage dude, and I don’t think any American is sad that he died. I sure am not.  However, the true debate is to whether or not he needed to die at this moment."
Was there an imminent threat to American lives? Will his assassination cause a bigger threat to American lives? Is this an act of war? What will Iran’s reaction be? What were the motivations behind this attack?
"We don’t have all of the answers for these questions as of yet. According to some sources in the US government, there was an attack coming within days. According to others, there was no particular attack coming and Trump just chose the most extreme option presented to him in retaliation to people saying “Death to America” outside of our embassy, the one meant to make other options look reasonable. I don’t know what the truth is, and I doubt we’ll know for sure until later."
"However, what we did was an act of war. To flip it around, if General Mattis was in Canada and Iran killed him, we would declare war faster than you could say “wait, wtf?” Heck, if Iran attacked a boat full of random US citizens in questionably their waters we’d declare war (look at Vietnam). Considering that the Iranians are incensed about this and the fallout of the Nuclear Peace Agreement, I highly doubt that we won’t see threats to American lives from this. They would come off as weak to their supporters otherwise. And this certainly won’t make the more western-loving part of Iran more powerful. We just decimated our relationship with Iran for a long time."
"And finally, I have no idea what the motivations were behind this attack. There have been several theories going around, but there’s a <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox10phoenix.com/news/trump-claimed-in-2011-2012-that-obama-would-start-war-with-iran-to-get-reelected.amp"">video</a> that seems particularly poignant now. Even if you don't believe that’s true of today, I'd say it's reasonable for people to be suspicious of it especially with him getting impeached and the looming election this year."
"EDIT: I'm bad at embedding links, and I rephrased the last part."
Didn't John Brennan assist 9/11 terrorists through the Middle East as well?
Defending him? Or condemning poking the bear
"Nobody likes this guy, people dislike escalating a situation that may lead to war more. "
I thought trump was meant to be a peace time president?
"Wait. Who (running for public office), that is a Democrat, is defending this piece of shit? Is this really happening? Or, is it just the shits on CNN?"
"I don’t think anyone is defending him at all, i think what people are upset about is the way he did it. I’m canadian and fairly young so i’m still learning about your politics and all that, but from what i’ve been reading, do you not need congress approval before an attack like that?"
Way to miss the entire point boys! This was a complete act of war without any provided justification. No one is saying he was a saint that deserved to be protected- they're saying Trump made a decision that could absolutely lead to widespread war and as of yet hadn't produced a shred of evidence to justify it.
justification.
"A cursory reading of the history of Quds Force provides ample justification. You can dislike the decision, but to claim it is without justification is ludicrous and ignorant."
"No it's not. Yo, Qud's are bad. Have been for ages. But for a president to commit an act of war without congressional approval there has to be a credible, eminent threat to Americans. No justification has been given and it's been, what, three days? Not even to us, but to Congress no justification has been given. It's an illegal act of war."
They are a terrorist organization nothing more needs to be said and in fact I believe it was the Obama administration that made this legally copacetic.
...this entire thing is possible because of the war powers instituted under Bush in 2001 my dude. Obama didn't do much to increase the military ability of the president.
"Barry exploded over 2,600 people with drones and invaded Libya without consulting Congress."
"Don't confuse Obama with the entirety of NATO kid. There was an entire coalition that went into Libya, it wasn't just Obama doing it on a whim. Same with the whole Biden-Ukraine thing. The entire UN was pushing for that prosecutor to be dropped, it wasn't Obama going rogue."
"The Obama administration was corrupt, kid."
"I'm tired of this comment, it's just ignorant. They attacked our embassy, and that's ignoring them shooting down our drone, threatening to attack the US, hijacking American and European ships, not living up to their nuclear agreement, and countless terrorist attacks.  The dude was already considered a terrorist by the US, UN and several orgs."
Who attacked the embassy? Did Iranian forces attack the embassy?
"There's no way you just used the nuclear agreement, that we backed out of, as justification for this. They honored the agreement until Trump just decided to drop out. What's more, Trump only has legal justification to commit an act of war if there's an imminent threat, and thus far no justification has been given. Funnily enough, Trump was also pushing the idea that Obama would start a war with Iran to help his reelection chances. Weird how this one is playing out."

"Yeah, it’s funny how democrats were COMPLETELY silent about al-Awlaki and his 16year old son(both US citizens) being droned under suspicions of working with al-Qaeda. Guess what? There STILL hasn’t been any direct evidence to support that... and the Dems are STILL COMPLETELY SILENT."
But now? In a VERY similar scenario executed by a president they don’t like? It means war! War is imminent! ...What war by the way lmaoo... do you people even know what you’re outraged about anymore? 
Sorry for your loss. Soleimani seemed like a good dude. Hopefully you guys can mourn him in peace.
"Man, the Republican party doesn't stand for anything but trying to piss off liberals does it?"
"...Also, attacked our embassy? There's literally no evidence of it that has been presented. And I would love to be able to take the man at his word, but he literally drew in sharpie on a hurricane map to make it look like it would hit Alabama rather than admit he mispoke. No wonder we don't take him at his word, he lies all the time and you guys love it for the memes."
Who is defending him?
"Been to <a href=""/r/worldpolitics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/worldpolitics</a>, <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a>, CNN, or listened to any Dem in Congress recently?"
Thank you for failing to provide an example of democrats defending him. 
Attacking Trump =/= defending this guy. Saying Trump did this as a distraction / to help win the next election is not defending this guy. Also saying he was a military general and not some random terrorist is not defending this guy.
"He was a general by their standards, the head of a terrorist group by Western standards."
the head of a terrorist group by Western standards.
"What standards? A person from the middle east responsible with killing people? Seems like ""terrorist"" is being thrown around just to justify this attack or else it would be considered illegal."
"Look, it's not my fault you didn't know who this guy was before this weekend."
"The EU joined the U.S. in designating him a terrorist in 2012, under President Obama. The Quds force has been recognized as a terror group by the U.S., Canada, the EU, and several Gulf nations."
"There's nothing illegal here. He has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of Iranians alone, as well as many Americans. "
"The only debate here is whether the timing is wise, which is valid. Saying that Trump is trying to retcon him as a terrorist because the strike was illegal is just ignorant."
Yes. I did not see any examples. Can you provide one?
Yes. Democrats hate America.
I'd say Democrats will latch to whatever they think gets them into power so they can massively restructure america
"6 in one hand, half dozen in another"
"Only 2 thing the Democrats care about is Money and Power, nothing else."
I still refuse that. Dems care about others (maybe not the elected ones). 
They're just going about it in a way which messes everybody up in the long run IMO
"May i ask you what ""others"" the dems care about? Because they're just being anti-American right now."
other americans. The general welfare of their fellow citizens. I think the lefties I know personally truly care and are just wrongminded in their way of going about it. They also default to Trump is bad no matter what. Makes for tough conversations.
Want positive outcomes. But they keep sticking forks in sockets
"Well... i agree and disagree to a point. Democrats and lefties are always going to hate President Trump. No matter what he does. But i disagree that Democrats care about Americans, they just want they're votes to stay in power. I truly believe that. I'm happy to hear your opinion though."
"The crazy ones and the elected ones seem to be a majority or at least in loudness. This is why people leaving right now some crazy people with decent ideas, and some ideas that cripple americans, or joe biden and the status quo under elected officials that hate you and try to pretend they the good guy.   Or annoying trump tweets winning small amount of change/ victories that will better the country. Some bipstistan deals. Does not mean you have to.like or love the guy just keep winning small amounts and wait to see what comes next. "
"I'll admit his policies and the like are lacking abit, but from a business side of politics hes done some good things. No one but an idiot would say that."
you have to spell idiot right when you spell idiot
edit: I think we generally agree. The deck does seem overly stacked against. 
I just don't think the underlying motive is being adverse to american interests on the part of the Dems. Just shallow political expediency
My bad I did type a little to fast lol
only joshing
Lol I know
"Are they defending him though?
Besides, why anyone would listen to anything Charlie Kirk has to say is baffling to me."
Charlie Kirk is not a Conservative
Charlie kirk is a piece of shit neocon.
It’s Trump&lt;Anyone at this point for them. It could be Adolf Hitler and they would still call Trump a bad guy.
I’m pretty sure they already have lol
On US soil? When? I want to know more..
"the embassy is technically us property, ergo, soil. its an act of war just as it would be if it were here on CONUS."
"I'm a bot, <em>bleep</em>, <em>bloop</em>. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:"

Why did he do these things?
"We took the liberty to make some inquiries concerning the Grounds of their pretentions to make war upon Nations who had done them no Injury, and observed that we considered all mankind as our friends who had done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation."
"<a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-09-02-0315"" rel=""nofollow"">The Ambassador answered us that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet,1 that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.</a>"
"I'm not sure how that answers my question, as it appears to have been written in 1786 and there's no reference to Soleimani, but I appreciate the reply."
It was indeed.  The reasons Muslims attack us today are the same as they were then.
"...which were incidentally, the same reasons as the previous thousand years."
"That seems odd, since it looks like he actually led campaigns against Islamic Fundamentalism. You'd think that if he had the same views he'd join ISIS, not fight against them. I've heard people say it's because we overthrew their government in the 50's over oil, installed a dictator, ""accidentally"" shot down an Iranian passenger plane killing 200 multi-ethnic non-combatants including 66 kids, and sided with Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war, but i guess that's also true.<br/>
Here's some sources if anyone appreciates them:<br/>

I'm going to hope that our siding with Iraq against won't be contested since it wasn't covered up like Operation Ajax, but you can easily find sources online."
"I'm not saying he's innocent, but it looks like the whole issue started with us overthrowing their government, and everything after that was them naturally retaliating against us."
Kind of a straw man to say left is defending him.  It's an argument against the tactic that is now dumping into war.  Not hard to really understand.
Oh you're forgetting one thing; OrAnGe MaN bAd!1
I think he killed JFK and stole my Amazon delivery too
And the death of tens of thousands (minimum) of innocent civilians throughout the region
An enemy of trump is an ally to democrats. So basically everyone who hates America is their friend
If only America's homeless and forgotten got this kind of love from Democrats.
"Democrats love the homeless, that is why they work so hard to make sure we have as many of them as possible."
"Note the dearth of commentary from other Middle Eastern countries about the tragic loss of a great leader. Democrats, Iranians, and Iraqis seem to be upset, and that's about it."
"Democrats and Iranian authorities, you mean. I'd question how many actual Iranians would mourn if there wasn't a gun pointed at them and someone telling them to."
I'm surprised the Democrats haven't already started campaigning for him to be nominated for the Nobel Peace prize.

Why?
Because it upsets people obviously!! Just because he’s planning on killing many more people including attacks on embassy doesn’t mean they should be judged so harshly... not like Soleimani or anyone a part of the same religion do this to anyone!
Give Soleimani a salami.
I don't care that hes dead at all. Fuck that guy. Lets go airstrike the leader of china now because hes a piece of shit too. Lets get Putin while were at it. See how that makes no sense and would start wars that we don't want or need? Maybe if we weren't in Iraq they wouldn't be killing us? We shouldn't be there in the first place.
"I generally subscribe to the categorical imperative but in the scope of world politics morality is not so clear. Surely you can admit there's room for nuance, at least more than ""Iran bad? China bad, too, so airstrikes on China OK."""
Yea I understand the nuance but apparently charlie kirk doesnt
"Only those comparisons are completely idiotic. “Let’s get Putin while WE’RE at it” 
Well Putin is the actually leader of a country not a general. Putin isn’t organization terrorist attacks on embassy’s. Putin isn’t organizing terror cells in multiple countries. 
Soleimani was killed in Iraq he wasn’t even in fucking Iran he’s in an active war zone leading TERRORISTS because he is himself a terrorist. Then you have the fucking audacity to compare him to real world leaders even if they’re, in the US eyes oppressive, they aren’t actively funding and leading radical Shia terrorism."
"The whole post is about ""Salami bad, murder him is good"" I  pointing out other bad people and showing why they aren't good targets strategically. Just like salami. (Misspelled on purpose). This is another ME war for nothing."
"Okay, so let's kill the Russian equivalent of the leader of the Revolutionary Guard?"
"The guy was in Iraqi directing forces that already killed an American and who just attacked an embassy.  He wasn't in Iran, he was a enemy combatant in an active war zone when he got smoked."
It does nothing but put us on the brink of another war. Which is the last thing America needs. We still haven't gotten out of the last couple middle east wars.  We should bring the troops home and focus on the real crisis. The Border
Iran was already going after us. To think they weren't is wrong.  
We should bring the troops home and focus on the real crisis. The Border
Posse Comitatus Act.
They are going after us because we are choking their economy. Before we get into who started what: Do you really want a war? Because I don't and I doubt Iran does.
Bro I didn't mean to use the military on the border. What I'm saying is the real enemy of the US is happening at the border. We are literally being invaded but instead of fixing that we are fucking around in the middle east when that gets us nothing. Just pisses off more people.
They are going after us because we are choking their economy. 
"They ""go after us"" for the topic du jour."
What I'm saying is the real enemy of the US is happening at the border. 
"Yup but Dems and many Republicans don't want to ""fix"" it because their donors profit."
and who are their donors? Its the same people that want the ME destabilized
Agreed.
If you agree and know who is behind this then why play into their game give them what they want. Which is war with Iran
I don't think killing Salami has to play into what they want.
At what point do we take action though? These guys attacked our embassy. Should that be allowed with impunity? Why was he in Iraq to begin with? These people work against us and kill our allies. Not to mention our people. I don't want another war I was in the last one. At the same time we can't let people attack our embassy.
"If we werent there, they couldnt kill our people. Impunity? Well when someone is literally destroying your country and economy you are gonna try to do something about it. Thats what Iran is doing. What allies are they killing exactly? Other than the US soldiers in the region."
"Id consider Iraqi s our allies. I worked with them there are decent people there. Alot of the terrorism in Iraq comes from iran. Do you understand how dangerous this country is? They kill gays, Jews, and treat women very badly. How can you support these groups in our country and at the same time support Iran that tries to destroy everything not of the old school. Again I will say I don't want war."
I dont consider Iraq our ally. Them killing gays and jews doesnt change my opinion one bit. I dont support them at all. I just dont think doing things in the middle east that can cause a war is justified when they are not a direct threat to the US. I dont care about anyone else in the region tbh. Im America First like donald trump said he was. From my understanding most terrorism is funded by the saudis. but then again literally every country is claimed to be the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the middle east depending on who you ask in the media
"Because creating policy based off of only morality (thats conceding that hes bad) is autistic and needs a little more nuance with how we position ourselves geopolitically, saying ""killing him was good because he was bad"" only shows your lack of understanding when it comes to the situation in the middle east and our geopolitics in general."
I think he got killed because he was a terrorist and helped kill Americans...hundreds and more was planned.
Seems like a good standard to me.
"""killing him was good because he was bad"""
"If you have to put words in other peoples' mouths to ""win"" a discussion that shows you're not standing on firm ground."
👍
We could just pull or people out? Then he can just kill Iraqis or whatever
"Sure.  Or he could not, you know, fly to another country and plan to kill Americans."
"You somehow managed to say what i said you guys say, qoute me telling you that you say what you literally just said, and say that im putting words in your mouth, all in the same comment.
I literally said you are coming at it from only morality and then you prove my point by going ""he was gonna kill more people tho"""
"Please choose a stance either killing him because of morals is justified or thats not what you believe, you cant have both."
"I said ""kill Americans."""
Guess you missed that word?
"This has literally nothing to do with anything, killing americans is just as morally wrong as killing iraqis/persians/iranians, am i wrong?"
"killing americans is just as morally wrong as killing iraqis/persians/iranians, am i wrong?"
It gets <em>America</em> involved... especially when they're <em>American soldiers</em>.
"We dont need to be there to begin with, thats why we're involved."
The guy planned an attack at our <em>embassy</em> in another country that resulted in 4 Americans dead.  He didn't have to do that.
"Yes, because the democrats have become fcuking crazy!"
Yeah its pretty crazy
Yes
charlie kirk is neoliberal scum
"Remember, it's public school education, a system built on ignorance. A solid socialist training, and a media so corrupt, it's a propaganda machine, a UN that is inept. It's set up to fail. Do you really believe that they will educate you enough to overthrow them? Look, history is sanitized to keep you from learning from the pain and blood of the past."
This sounds like a crock of shit
"I keep saying it and it keeps holding true. It does not matter what Trump does, they will always hate him. He could cure cancer and solve world hunger and it wouldn't matter because orange man bad"
"If Trump didn't do what he did and the attacks Soleimani was reportedly planning were carried out, word would have leaked that Trump had a chance to take him out but didn't. We'd be hearing all about how Trump intentionally didn't do what needed to be done because he wanted the destruction so he'd have an excuse to go to war. They'd be dragging him through the coals for not killing Soleimani."
"When you're a Republican, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't as far as the left is concerned."
So go hard
Trump simulatiously puts cancer researchers and cancer doctors out of work while destroying several charity organizations responsible for helping hungry people! Orang Man Bad!
Meat eating at all time high since people not dying of cancer. Orange man doomed us all to climate change
"If Trump found the cure for cancer, the next day's headlines would read:"
"""<strong>Trump Puts Thousands of Cancer Researchers Out of Jobs</strong>"""
"You all beat me to this, because it's true. My step-dad (cool guy), who is pretty damn far left, hates Trump. Absolutely HATES him. Even he is starting to admit that the Democratic party is pulling transparent bullshit. If even he is starting to realize this, it's gonna be bad times for the Dems in 2020."
"Especially when they nominate Sanders, after a brokered and hostile convention.  They’re gonna have a bad time this year."
"Ya know, I thought Bernie was pretty much dead a month ago, but he's starting to get some heat again, probably because Biden is a) in the early throes of dementia and b) has been caught bragging about doing what they're trying to impeach Trump for."
Nothing would surprise me at this point.
"The party has been pushing Warren pretty hard. She's like the slightly less hateful Hillary, and they pushed her over Bernie last time."
I would be extremely surprised if the party machinery favors Bernie this time around.
My prediction has been that they'll nominate Hillary at the convention.
"Nah they’ll try to draft Michelle Obama.  I don’t think she’ll accept though, so it’ll be Sanders."
"We will see, Hillary wants it BAD and has a lot of large donors behind her."
TRUMP WITHELD CURE FOR CANCER FOR 10 YEARS
Oh actually I’m pretty sure Biden will be the one to cure cancer. He said so himself. Sounds foolproof.
I remember when Al Gore invented the internet. Good times.
I’m glad he’s waiting until he’s elected. Can’t have that happening too early.
Exactly this
CANCER IS OUR RIGHT!!!
"This is not only complete bullshit, it's dangerous thinking.  ""We"" are not ""your"" enemies, this division is fabricated by both sides to ensure our true enemies stay in power.

Don't doubt it. This is exactly what Hitler did too. He ran one of the most progressive governments to exist at the time with openly homosexual men  in high positions of power.
As soon as the economy went bad it was off to the concentration camps with all of them.

"Legitimate Question: Was Trump aloud to do what he did without any congressional authorization? If so, then why are Democrats upset?"
Was Trump aloud to do what he did without any congressional authorization? 
"Yes. Obama did it numerous times, even to American citizens. "
"If so, then why are Democrats upset? "
"Because it was a ""prominent Iranian government official,"" but mainly because ORANGE MAN BAAAAAAD!"
"Yes. Obama did it numerous times, even to American citizens."
Which is why Republicans and conservatives were critical. It wasn't the drone strikes (well some would be critical of those.) It was the fact American citizen targets were not getting due process. They were just being executed. You could argue though that some of these citizens kind of threw their citizenship away to become terrorist but that is another discussion.
Exactly. Extremely worse to me than killing an Iranian terrorist attacking our stuff IN IRAQ. 
"If an American went to the Brazilian embassy in Mexico and started a riot at the gates, trying to burn down the embassy, and Brazil took him out, would we care who the fuck it was?"

"He has 48 hours to notify congress, and they, in turn, can tell him to get out of whatever action he's committed according to the WPR if he uses the AUMF he can just say it's ongoing against Iraqi terrorists."
"Most of all, the Democrats were part in parcel to both of these laws and Congress has effectively delegated away it's authority. Some would question the laws constitutionality, but as of right now it hasn't been overturned in court."
More so the AUMF. That has been used to legally justify virtually every US military action in the Middle East for nearly two decades.
"Just so I understand this (forgive me I'm really really stupid), the WPR says he can do this, he just needs to tell congress within 2 days. What does he need to tell congress?

Reddit was screeching like crazy past few days. Everyone was whipping themselves into a frenzy and convinced themselves we were going to war with Iran. Lots of great “aged like milk” material.
Led by fear merchant media who is cashing in on the mania they spread. It's very gross.
But...but...but... CNN told me he was starting WWIII!11!1!!!1!!!1 R/politics told me that there'd be a draft and he was going to get us all killd!!!11!!!
"Not sure you got the memo, but remember his election got us all killed 3 years ago! This is apparently a weird version of the afterlife where we all have jobs,  higher pay,  less taxes,  and a record stock market. "
/s
Haha. Fear merchants
"Cool, but keep preemptive strikes an option. We don't need Iran to become nuclear."
Damn it i wanted to join the space force as a space shuttle door gunner
Trump showed great leadership by de-escalating and he has handled the situation admirably. 
"But let's not kid ourselves, if Trump did decide to escalate into a major war, then it would still have been an amazing decision he made according to his loyal supporters. They would be beating the war drums. Any decision he makes, whatever it is, is celebrated by his most fervent fans. "
"I'm prepared to praise him when I think he made the right decision, and also prepared to criticize him when I think he made an error."
I agree with you. I was surprised by how many people were cheering on his airstrike when I was just watching and holding my opinion to see what happened next.
"I understand and support why some people support him like that. With this media and this Democrat party alot of people figure he has enough people beating him down.
This media has went criminally overboard in their treatment of him these past 3 years. They have damaged and separated Americans irreparably."
Good point. The long running Russia collusion hoax has damaged the media's credibility and exacerbated divisions.
"Russia collusion was the tip of the iceberg, the point where more people saw how corrupt... but they've been doing it for many many years."
"I don’t like to claim that I am a Trump supporter-I’m a conservative who voted fo Trump and supports the presidency- but it can be damn difficult to call him out when he makes poor decisions, tbh. The Left is so rabidly anti-Trump that I personally hate to give a centimeter of foothold lest they take it for a mile, so it can be easier not to criticize and just go along with it."
"Not sure what to think of this decision yet, personally- I suppose we shall see in time."
"If we're talking about <em>total war</em>, then sure.  If we're talking about limited, calculated strikes on key targets, then no."
"Not in this day and age. Congress shouldn't have delegated their war responsibilities to the executive, but whining after the fact is pathetic."
"Rand Paul is a brilliant statesman when it comes to domestic policy, but completely daft when it comes to foreign policy."
Yea except not really
What war?
Libertarians gonna libertarian.  You can't expect a libertarian to ever be ok with military intervention.
I agree he should have got it

"The question doesn't really make sense.  The description as a political religion is not uncommon in describing fascism, in spite of the fact that some fascists certainly made use of religion to avoid the <em>kulturkampf</em>."
"I've been tongue in cheek in noting that the party that believe in a strong unitary executive is the party holding the presidency.  The truth is, though, that while both parties inherently support it (i.e., it's baked into the Constitution), the idea is historically Hamiltonian so it has closer ties to Democrats from an institutional perspective, though both parties have pushed its limits.  Jackson, Lincoln, Bush 2, Obama; all have taken strong unitary executive approaches, as have many others at times."
"Regardless, unless one ascribes to the idea of the State <em>as</em> religion or at the least, the voice of religion, the two really don't have anything to do with each other."

"Punished for not crying: Thousands of North Koreans face labour camps for not being upset enough about death of Kim Jong-il <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2085636/North-Koreans-face-labour-camps-upset-death-Kim-Jong-il.html?ito=native_share_article-masthead"">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2085636/North-Koreans-face-labour-camps-upset-death-Kim-Jong-il.html?ito=native_share_article-masthead</a>"
Small pp move
So that explains the videos of North Koreans crying at his funeral way too dramatically?
They were crying like their life depended on it.
Because it did...
That's incredibly sad. I believe authoritarianism oppresses the human spirit.
"Wait, what?!?!?"

"Death is not the worst evil, but rather when we wish to die and cannot"
I mean that sounds cool to say but it’s not true. If someone wants to live and they are killed there is no option for recourse or redemption. Whereas if someone wants to die and can’t for whatever reason there will be future opportunities to die.
North Korea is such a black mark on world history. Future generations will look back and wonder how we tolerated it.
A story you won't hear on the news loud and clear in USA.
"In America we have a choice whether to show up at a parade or government function.We visited Cuba a year ago,it’s a different world there.Our Cuban tour guide opened up to us after several days what’s it’s really like."
What did they say?  Are they forced to participate and in public events?
"He lived in an apartment building which is common in Havana,you have to be careful what you say or do around neighbors.He said you’re encouraged to participate in public events,parades and welcoming government officials from other countries..He put the extra tips we gave him in a hidden compartment in his trunk.There was a vast difference in where the general public lived and government officials lived.It made us appreciate what we have even more."
He put the extra tips we gave him in a hidden compartment in his trunk.
"Depending on when you went there, that may be because it was illegal for Cubans to possess US currency (it isn't anymore).  They also had a dual currency system (which they are starting to phase out), where tourists used CUC which was pegged to the dollar, while Cuban nationals used CUP, which was worth $0.04."
"The left doesn't understand that authoritarianism is the way of the world and has been for millennia. Democracy, rule of law, the innate value of human life, freedom of speech, general liberty -- these are largely Western ideas, rooted in Western culture, and they are only prominent at the moment because of the ""American global presence"" they love to rail against."
America is special. The degree to which other countries are like us is the direct result of our policies over the last 75 years.
"But the American presence isn't going to last forever. We can't maintain it and we don't want to maintain it. As we start to withdraw from the world and start focusing on ourselves again, however, the left is in for a deep shock. Other cultures don't place peace at the premium we do and authoritarian regimes will always work feverishly to seize power where they can. The post-American world we are heading into will not be one of peace."
People are not all alike and cultures are not all alike. The left has confused one culture's dominance for the status quo and that's a dangerous mistake. One can only hope that one day the left will be shocked into understanding that what we have here is something dear and precious so that they can start supporting it instead of railing against it with every breath.
Well said.
"It warms my heart to see positive facts about America not getting downvoted.<br/>
Not sure how you managed to do it, but well done sir."
You know what part of reddit this is?
Very well put. This is the key to understanding how the left and right differ so broadly on foreign policy.
"I don’t follow, how does this highlight America’s excellency in foreign policy?"
"This was the equivalent of mad dog Mattis being assassinated, of course they would get a rally around the flag effect."
"Please remind me, when was Mattis waging covert war against a country we supposedly didn't have open hostilities with while physically in a region under the protection of the same?"
"Any so-called ""government official"" whose duties involve organizing terrorism foregoes any right to legitimacy or the protections of international law. The fact that those of you one the left see an equivalency here scares me."
"Please remind me, when was Mattis waging covert war against a country we supposedly didn't have open hostilities with while physically in a region under the protection of the same?"
"Syria. Iraq. Pakistan. Afghanistan. Niger. Libya. Plenty of other conflicts the US is involved with doing drone strikes that kill innocent civilians, all without a formal declaration of war or hostilities."
"Any so-called ""government official"" whose duties involve organizing terrorism foregoes any right to legitimacy or the protections of international law. "
"Many countries say the same thing about the United States. They see us as the terrorist and imperialists who disregard international law. And again, our unilateral assassination attempt on Iran’s high rank was not legal according to international law."
The fact that those of you one the left see an equivalency here scares me.
"So unilaterally assassinating someone is the way to go with this? Don’t call me a leftist just because you support warmongerers. All high level military leaders have dirty blood on their hands, including ours. It’s a tough thing to say but America doesn’t always act in the best interests of the world."
Comparing SecDef to the leader of Quds...
Our SecDef considered a “terrorist” to them. They just designated the pentagon and US military as terrorist organizations for our assassination.
Your postmodernist bullshit is showing. 
Not everything is subjective. The morals of those people in Iran who's beliefs you're defending by equating their moral values to the West's are <strong><em>objectively</em></strong> worse and disgusting. 
Just because they <strong><em>believe</em></strong> they are in the right does not make it so.
Nowhere did I say it was subjective. I’m simply pointing out the semantic game some of my fellow “conservatives” are playing to justify war crimes. 
Please remember that this arrogance that we were <em>objectively</em> morally right against the “axis of evil” is what led to the Iraq war and over a million civilians dead.

Monarchy is mankind's default leadership style. It's democracy that is the new blip on the historical radar.
"Democracy, rule of law etc.... Western European concepts before America was even a twinkle."
Of course they were. That wasn't my point.
"My point was that America, as a nation state, was founded on them in a way that would have been impossible for Western European nations. It was built around them from the ground up."
Western European commitment to democracy is a relatively new phenomenon in the scheme of things.
I realized just now that I misread your statement... I thought that you said those were American concepts.. my bad.    
"You've got an interesting take.. I don't completely agree with it, but it's well thought out and presented.  In my opinion, you're somewhat conflating America's influences in democracy building around the world, and minimizing America's destabilizing influence in many countries.... BUT... that's a different argument for a different thread."
"And those are valid points as well... mine was a bit of a simplified presentation of my views because otherwise I have a tendency towards long windedness. I'd argue that while, yes, the United States does destabilize other nations and even wage war on a level that others don't at the moment, it's usually done to prop up a global system that, for the most part, has provided freedom and human rights on a level that's unprecedented in human history. Like you said, however, that's an argument for another thread."
"Personally, I think the ideal is for the US to withdraw its presence from foreign affairs. The traditional conservative position (before the Cold War) leans towards isolationism. But that's a tricky dance because pulling out all at once without a plan leaves dangerous vacuums of power in certain regions. We have to do it in a smart manner. I think that the world will be a less peaceful and harsher place as a result but the status quo is not sustainable, not for us and not for the rest of the world."
Reasonable people are allowed to disagree and have different takes... thank you for having an open mind!

When you look at the state of the world pre and post rise of America's place as the world's sole super power it's pretty easy to see that despite constant minor conflicts the world has been a substantially more peaceful place. 
Things like Iraq 2 Electric Boogaloo and regime change operations (things im against tbf) are extremely small scale compared to the utter mayhem of the pre american world order
"Ok that's a pretty easy point, yes way more peaceful than a hundred years ago but what does that have to do with "" what the left doesn't understand"" or Bernie Sanders ?"

Bombing and killing has not been exclusively republican or democrat my woke friend
"The wonderful thing about all of those authoritarian, dictatorial regimes is how they can force everyone into the streets to pretend to act bereaved when one of these thugs is killed."
"For today's Democrats this is a feature, not a bug."
Fear of death is quite the motivator.
"Many of those attending the funerals of these tyrants think by attending they avoid scrutiny by the police enforcers of the tyrant. They are virtue signaling their loyalty and allegiance to the dictator regardless of the horrors that dictator did. They do not do this from a sense of admiration, but from fear that if they do not weep visibly enough, they will be branded traitor and disappear or face reprisals."
That is the world they live in.
"Those in power love this show, as it grants false legitimacy for what they did, and more importantly gives them a sense of security that their power base is intact and not threatened, and the people are sufficiently cowed into compliance."
Those who celebrate the death can be faced with brutal reprisals. The Machiavellian approach of the tyrant it to utterly destroy foes.
It is only years later with no threat of reprisals do you stand any chance of hearing what the people really thought of the tyrant.
I hate mandatory funerals. Last time I didn't go to mandatory funeral I didn't get rations for next month.
Mourn or die!
These people are forced to attend these types of events.
Nothing like being forced to go to someone’s funeral
About what?
Probably that the amount of people that showed up for his funeral isn’t indicative of how beloved he was. 
People generally show up for funerals of dictators out of fear.
"Ahhh thanks for clarifying, I thought the suggestion that reddit is saying hardly anyone attended"
That is what most of what people on Reddit are saying.
"Most Redditors are saying that the people of Iran hate the regime. I mean, look at the 1500 dead protestors"
You clearly don't visit politicalhumor or worldnews if you think that's the case.
Oh I don't well then OOF
"I wouldn't call it fear. I would call it sincere hope that if they show up like expected, things wont get worse."
Nope it's not. I went to Fidel's funeral by choice. He took my parents off the streets right after the revolution. My parents were able to make money and live in a decent apartment because of Fidel.
Thanks u
"Authoritarians typically have higher approval ratings than western leaders, I think it’s unfair to characterize their support as ingenuine, this was like mad dog mattis being assassinated."
You comparing someone like mad dog mattis to an actual terrorist is incredibly ignorant and insulting. 
Of course authoritarian leaders have higher approval ratings when disapproval means a bullet to the head.
I’m just showing you the Iranian perspective. We killed THEIR mad dog Mattis. Of course Iran is going to be pissed and retaliate.
"Authoritarian leaders have higher approval ratings because there is a rally around the flag effect, not necessarily because there’s a gun to their head."
Levada-Center research is an example of a trusted independent NGO polling organization that tracks rises and declines in approval ratings.
It isn’t like this was an unprovoked strike. And it isn’t really retaliation if they were already planning to attack us before this whole thing. They’re like a child who keeps punching a dog in the face that’s surprised when it gets bit. 
"The flag effect may be a thing, but don’t pretend they aren’t acutely aware of the gun pointed at their head. "
I googled the levada center and it’s a Russian pollster that was intimidated into not publishing polls before the last Russian “election”? Yeah...idk how much I trust that.
Hmm. I haven’t heard about the poll publishing thing. Although I will say some countries like France ban publishing polls right before an election to prevent skewing the results.
Liberals could of used that in 2016.
"How totalitarian states can get people out for forced marches. If a republican or democratic died, no one would line the streets in the US for example. We would have our daily lives to attend to. No one is also forcing us to March for some sort of &lt;inert thing to March for here&gt;."
Thanks u
Iran is on hard times right now.
Many were there for the free food.
When the choice is March or die.
The common denominator: None of the funeral attendees have any ‘free will’.
The other thing all four have in common is being admired by Bernie Sanders
"Sort of odd how mass funerals in the West don't have folks being trampled to death, but mass funerals in statist countries have fatalities during the mourning..."
"""Terrorist sympathizers attend terrorist's funeral."""
See? Nobody cares.
"""People forced to attend dictator's funeral lest they get disappeared next.""*"
FTFY
This just confirms what I’ve been saying for a while now: people are fucking stupid.
"They forced business to close and people were made to go, so yeah, there's going to be a lot of people there."
Just waiting for a Soleimani Blvd to pop up in San Francisco.
It's just like north Korea. If you don't show up and cry your family get put into force labor or killed. It's no wonder these crowds for horrible people's funerals are so big.
Yea but the difference between them is that we are directly responsible for killing one of them.
Soliemany or however you spell his name= small pp.
"Stalin's funeral is just like North korean funerals, where people are forced to cry. Hugo chavez provided universal benefits(Not very sure about the legitimacy of this) and the economy flourished under him, Castro was renowned in cuba. The one that I cannot explain is qasem soleimani. I think this is living proof that middle eastern countries have lots of extremists."
Wait! Fidel Castro is dead? Next you will try to tell me that Spain’s Franco is dead. Hat tip #ChevyChase
When the media showed 'crying mourners' it made me burst out laughing. Did people forget iran is a regime?
56 where killed by crush injuries of the mob...maybe driving a dead body though the streets is a stupid idea.
"Chavez is a different story man, Chavez was truly loved by a certain portion of the population, and was highly respected by the other, but people who did not love him they just hated his economic policies, apart from that, Chavez isn't as bad as the rest, Chavez was never a supporter of terrorism even though he used the FARC for illegal fundings, but the moment the narcos/thugs killed 1 single civilian they were imprisoned or even killed (Makled/Lina Ron/Odreman), now if Maduro dies the story is different"

War crimes.

Yes killing innocent civilians really puts the morals back into conservatism.
Show me proof they're all innocent and I'll concede your point.
You don’t believe in democratic values do you?
Killing innocent people without due process is exactly why America has a bad human rights record.
"If you think the United States of America has a bad human rights record, you're probably in the wrong forum, brother."
Seeing that users are calling for murdering of Iranian citizens citizens I don’t think so.
Looks like you stuttered.
We don't owe enemy combatants due process.
You can’t label an entire nations civilian population as enemy combatants to justify genocide.
"There's been no genocide, and nobody has labeled an entire nation's civilian population as an enemy combatant."

haha lol. They could exchange CNN with plenty of others though.
This is one of their best articles.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA.  Damn the Bee always gets me.  Best headlines around.
Geeze its satire. So is the onion. They're not trying to pass off their contents as real.
"There’s still room for both.  The Bee, news parody;  CNN, self-parody."
This too close to the truth; on twitter there has been a call to label 'Bee links as satire -- this is how stupid the left has become
There are fewer things I like better than Mark Levin doing his Brian Stelter impersonation.
That was a democratic POTUS. It’s different now.
Can you imagine someone as unhinged as Joe in charge of the military?
He would rely on 'the Congress' to tell him what to do. Yet people would see him as a great president because of his soft policy like Obama is seen now by the left.
...because his “missile forces” missed everything
"Here, let us demonstrate precision aiming...."
"22 missiles at $1 million each from a country in deep economic trouble, with minimal damage. A passenger airline with 176 on board whose families will all probably sue Iran for millions if there is any tie between the crash and Iran's attack. Loss of Soleimani clearly impacted their ability to wreak havoc. Maybe Iran needs to declare victory and quit while they are ahead."
"He said ""such military actions are not enough"". And his foreign minister said he doesn't seek an escalation. So I interpret Khamenei's message as being he wants the UN to do something to us, or turn all the countries against us. Iran doesn't have the money to fight a war and they know we would wipe out their oil refineries in one strike, then they really have nothing."
Well he murdered a whole bunch of civilians last night in the shoot down of the Ukrainian flight. I cant wait to see how the media spins this one.
Normally rational Iranian Leadership makes honest mistake is how our media will have the headline.
You need to add more orange man bad.
Trumps escalation has caused actions which lead to the loss of Ukrainian life aboard plane. Possibly as retaliation for Ukraine's involvement in the impeachment process.

Journalist Yashar Ali:
"“I can’t believe I’m seeing people saying that this was a face saving move by Iran and now that there haven’t been any US casualties, that we should move on. The level of naivety is astonishing. Do people really think this is how Iran is going to retaliate?” Ali concluded. "
“The problem is so many people have thought about this situation through the lens of conventional warfare. So they believe if there is no conventional warfare that the situation has deescalated. But conventional warfare should have never been the concern!”
"If it isn’t good enough, maybe you should stop."
Susan Rice is trash

"I know, they just don’t get it and never will. Obama was an insanely weak leader. Trump stands up for us and won’t back down to anyone."
"I suppose that is a step up from Obama, where he got caught spying on them."
Is she related to condeleeza?
"From my research, no."
Because we actually protect them...
"We treat them like they owe us money, which they do."
I think she means her allies
She's in mourning.

His family can sue.
"They can sue for whatever they want, but that doesn't mean a judge won't toss it out immediately. I could sue someone for insulting my 3rd great grandfather but it doesn't really mean shit."
They won’t have standing. He also was never smeared by Fox News.
"In March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich. The suit alleges that the report fueled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and caused the family emotional distress."

"Ah, emotional distress.  That's what the Sandy Hook parents sued for."
"Yeah, that's reasonable."
"But, surely Seth Rich wasn't smeared or slandered in any way like the teenaged minor Nick Sandmann was very adult journalists and celebrities."

"""Some people refer to"" = literally the entire world with the exception of 0.02% of the population"
I think you might be off by a couple of orders magnitude. More like 0.0002%.
"You could be correct.  I was working with numbers that I'm aware of off the top of my head, which are US federal prison numbers.  No, I'm not kidding, that's the exact percentage of trans prisoners in the federal prison system nationwide."
Honestly it doesn’t matter what those trans numbers are because it is all an attempt to push legitimacy of people who suffer from serious mental disease as normal.
"I find it very important to keep up with those numbers.  How wasteful it is that we spend such an inordinate amount of time, energy, money, blood, sweat, and tears over less than 1% of our population."
"My best example of getting lost in the numbers is the homosexual community.  There's a YouTube video out there (I searched, can't find it now) where an interviewer asks random people ""What percentage of the population do you think is gay?""  Almost everyone guessed 20-40%, when the real answer is less than 2%.  People think it's 20-40% because of the amount of time we spend/waste talking about gay issues when it really only applies to such a small portion of our society."
I’ve done the research and the numbers on this very topic. The homosexual community in the US and globally is between 2% - 4%. That includes males/females. And as flippant as I was about the percentage of Trans is due to the numbers being so utterly low. But that doesn’t negate the sheer propaganda that erroneously tries to conflate these numbers. And as you put it the time we as society conflate homosexual issues as being larger than they really are.
So your research has found the percentage of homosexuals to be the same in the United States as it is in the rest of the world?  I was actually unaware of this.

I'ts kinda interesting to note that Chess actually does have a separate competition for Women.
"The only reason this is the case is because there are no women in the same stratosphere of FIDE rating as the men. There is no reason that there can't be a woman in the Candidate's tournament going after the world title down the road. The only thing holding women back in chess is that no one has been good since Judit Polgar, who got to 8th in the world at her peak. So, in an attempt to keep women's chess relevant and hopefully grow in the future, they do have their own separate category. The current champion is Ju Wenjun, current FIDE rating of 2584, which puts her raked 310 currently among active players (not good lol)."
"It would be really cool to see strong competition between men and women at the highest levels of non-physical competition, but it is probably never going to happen regularly."
"I know it's from last year, but with all the current legislation about TGs and sports, it's perfect for now."
And it's hilarious!
I don't think they have in a long time really.
"Weaken the military and send taxpayer money to countries that chant, Death to America.  What could go wrong?"
"As imperfect as Trump may be, I honestly believe he has this country's best interest at heart."
"I second this. I was extremely skeptical of him at first (didn’t even vote for him or Godzillary), but I have to admit he’s won me over. He may tweet some stupid things, grandstand, have a checkered past in the eyes of some, etc., but you can’t argue with results. If he successfully deescalates the current situation with Iran, keeps building up the economy, and the media moves on from these BS impeachment proceedings, it’s hard to imagine that he won’t get re-elected."
"The best part to me is that the more good things he does, the angrier the Left gets. In the last few days alone he’s made Schumer, Pelosi, and others defend an authoritarian dictator state, it’s hilarious."
"I can relate to a lot of what you said, and I'm one of the ones who does consider his past <em>quite</em> checkered. "
"He's done a lot of good in defending our national values (more than I think any other Republican would have, even those who more strongly <em>hold</em> those values) simply because he doesn't fall for the ""You only care about me if you give me what I want!"" silliness. Whether it's because he doesn't care about looking ""nice"" or realizes it sounds the same coming from adults as it does when your 5 year old does it doesn't really matter when it comes to policy."
"The economy is doing very well, though I haven't followed it closely enough to tell you exactly what he's done to make it so successful. I do think his efforts on getting us out of deals that had the potential to strongly control how American business operated (like the TPP) had a positive impact. Not letting nations like China take advantage of us endlessly has ultimately put us in a better position to make deals with them."
"I also sort of appreciate his military policy. I realize he's found a way to upset both isolationists and interventionists, but his stance on the matter is well defined. Only go to war with an objective, throw everything you have at reaching that objective, and then be done. He was being consistent both with the strikes he ordered and the troops he pulled out. The ""just talk it out"" approach doesn't work when nations are willing to lie to your face and then go behind your back (as Iran has done so many times) but stationing troops everywhere ""just in case"" is really taxing on the American people. Somehow we almost always end up with both methods at the same time."
I can't see the good he does. All I see is his stupidity.
Care to give me some examples of good he does for your country please?  Genuine question

Nice but wasted he'll never respond.
"Simple people like me see his campaign claims as 1) lowering taxes and 2) border security. In my opinion and on my tax form, he's delivered both in spades. "
"Further, I think his ""for the people"" attitude is genuine, and the stock market's recent all-time highs is testament to that. Sure, other factors like inflation could explain some of it but I believe Trump has been a positive factor in that."
Thank you for a genuine response mate. I may not agree but I appreciate your time. Have a great day man
He aint...and he does.
What have democrats accomplished other than spread hate and raise taxes?
Given pallets of cash to Iran
Lessen the restriction of abortion in some states.
"And that’s an amazing thing, you fucking monster"
"I recognize it’s the internet, and I’m having difficulty in catching sarcasm. "
I hope you’re being facetious lol
I sincerely love that quote.
"I hope he also extends this to the Christians of the middle east, who have often found themselves on the wrong side of US interests."
Trump is honest he may exaggerate things alot but compared to the lying lifetime politicians he does have the country's best interests in mind. Who the hell else would put up with what he deals with  every day. Trump truly loves this country and only those who feel the same get him. Our country may have flaws but it the best country in the world. How much abuse can it take the PC left is taking away our history as well as what we stand for now but Trump gets it.
"He’s good at pretending he gets it, yes."
"lol he's not good at pretending, he says the dumbest things about stuff but he turns out right more often than not so I've stopped caring what he says and look at what he does"
Yeah Trump is a lot better if you pretend his Twitter doesn't exist
He's said he supports the LGBT community so idk... I guess it's <em>something</em> but yeesh this world has gone crazy lately.
"I have always hated to think God sent somebody or something or that God used someone or something. It is rather convenient to say in validating what you believe should be. But the more I look at how the world responds to Trump and what he does, the more I think he is an answer to prayers. He was the perfect person to tap and put in this position to upset the apple cart. He didn't start this trend but he codified it, anchored it, and is now leading it."
"When you go against the prevailing winds, those who who go with them will go nuts. And that is exactly what is happening."
"Reminds me of something I read once about Hindu mythology. Certain schools believe that history comes in cycles; and that now and then a figure will stand out as a catalyst, either against the direction of the current cycle, or to announce the beginning of the next. I realize that sounds Messianic, but in their understanding it's frequently attributed to world leaders like Napoleon or Genghis Kahn. "
Make of that what you will.
"That is certainly interesting, but nothing Trump has done could be likened to Genghis Kahn or Napoleon. Napoleon was a brutal warmonger who took over much of Europe, at his peak, he had control of most of it and killed millions through his wars and other means. Genghis Kahn was similar a similarly brutal person."
Trump tweets stuff and stands up to bullies. I think the sort of muted comparison you draw here is not fair at all. Trump has killed terrorists who brutalized and/or killed many innocent people as well as having killed over 600 Americans and gave harbor to the 9/11 hijackers. Trump killed a man who helps commit horrible atrocities.
"This constant likening of Trump to your Hitlers and Napoleons and Kahns of history is such weak comparison. Trump is much more like the rough and tumble, abrasive, imperfect heroes of the past... he is more like the Churchills of history."
"Don't get me wrong, it wasn't my intention to make a direct comparison in that regard; those were simply the examples I recall when originally reading about the belief. Clearly, there are more ways to represent a catalyst to an era than being a warlord."
"Oh I know you weren't. I was mainly challenging it because there are lurkers who would jump on what you said not realizing you were just offering an interesting point to consider. I like the term ""catalyst"" for Trump, I've used it myself. I tend to go to the spiritual route because it is hard to explain where this movement really came from, why Trump chose this cycle to run, and how all the events led to him. I mean there are simple answers to why he chose to run, but the question of the timing of everything else seems almost miraculous."
"That said, the reactions are predictable... almost chemical or mathematical. So ""catalyst"" is perfectly apropos."
"As a human being, I find him to be pretty close to morally bankrupt and a terrible choice to be a role model. "
"As a president, I find him effective, efficient and (aside from his Twitter, because I don't care what he says, I care what he does) measured."
"President Obama did not require Congress's approval to launch attacks in Libya, nor does he need congressional authorization to keep U.S. forces there, the top House Democrat said Thursday."
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the White House violated neither the Constitution nor the War Powers Resolution when it launched military operations in the war-torn African nation in March without Congress's endorsement.
"<a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/house/166843-pelosi-backs-obama-on-libya"">https://thehill.com/homenews/house/166843-pelosi-backs-obama-on-libya</a>"
Let me explain it for you Democrats are cowards and will let other nations attack and kill USA citizens freely.
"No sane person wants war... but the dems do. They're silently praying to science - a tree, whatever - for it because it could hurt Trumps 2020 reelection. "
Same for a recession.
I like how the article says that they're US college students with US drivers licenses and yet they needed a mandarin interpreter to translate for them in court...
They’re no more American than I am Chinese
"What does having a us drivers license have to do with not speaking english fluently? Please, do tell."
Are they taking all of their US college courses in Mandarin?
"You have to pass an English proficiency test to be an international student. However, in FUCKING COURT, i would imagine they would want a translator to be able to communicate as clearly and effectively as possible since English is not their first language. Use your brain."
So they speak English well enough to understand when they were ordered to turn around and leave but instead circled around to take photos of a military installation.
"Im not defending what they did, but you have to put things into perspective. If you were charged with espionage in a foreign country and you werent fluent in their language, would you <em>not</em> want a translator? Would you want to struggle to understand what is being said against you, and struggle to defend yourself? Like honestly. Im not saying what they did was ok, i just cant stand such blatant ignorance."
"Also, driving tests are supplied in other languages, specifically so that people who are not native English speakers may take the test without language being an additional barrier"
This is why you can't have open borders or high immigration rates. There's no reason to assume you can trust people with ties to other countries.
Is communist China working on a Pearl Harbor style attack on American military bases?
"Before the raid on Pearl Harbor, imperial Japan ramped up its spying activities massively around oahu <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeo_Yoshikawa"">including using its consul to Hawaii to snoop around pearl harbor</a>."
We are now seeing the same disturbing trend coming out of China.
let me know when they have a navy capable of projecting force beyond china let alone a aircraft force capable of doing so. what they are most likely doing is trying to get pictures of workers for exploitation later on.
5 years from now is the estimate.
So what is the punishment for being a foreign spy from a hostile nation?
"Iran won’t hand over the black box.  They’re hiding something. <a href=""https://apple.news/Ao8_vLp0lQ6uRgSnxe5aufA"">https://apple.news/Ao8_vLp0lQ6uRgSnxe5aufA</a>"
How about unfortunate attack error? I seriously doubt Iran would intentionally shoot down a plane full of Canadians and Europeans- they desperately need Europe to side with them to avoid sanctions. I also seriously doubt it was an on-board failure- the video of the plane going down in flames after a perfectly normal takeoff is simply too much to believe that. Modern planes simply don't explode into giant fireballs without some kind of external factor.
How about unfortunate attack error?
"This would be my guess as well. I can't see Iran shooting down a plane full non-Americans as part of their ""retaliation."""
...or Iran mistakenly shot their own plane out of the sky?
It's not their plane. It's Ukraine's. And killing a 176 people is a hell of an accident to make in today's world. Especially when they're not handing the Blackbox over to Ukraine.
Thanks for the correction. What the hell was a Ukrainian airliner doing in a hot zone?
"It’s Iran’s capitol they have flights to all over. This was just one unlucky civilian airliner that probably got downed by over eager and incompetent Iranian Air Defense, right after it took off from their airport too."
People are trying to get out of the area before things kick off.
That and the only anti air missiles in the area are Iranian.
Considering the aircraft departed and crashed near Tehran there are no other countries Air defence sites that could reach the aircraft.
Ukraine you say?! Trumps quid pro quo goes deeper than we thought!
"I thought they said they would work with the Ukrainians because it’s a Ukrainian company, but not hand the boxes over to Boeing like you normally would. "
If they have changed their stance then this is even more convincing that they shot it down instead of “mechanical issues” bringing the plane down.
"Fuck! they found  out our weakness, untrained religious fanatics with pissed off bottle rockets."
Worked for them in Afghanistan.
Too bad Iran and Afhanistan are not comparable to one another. Afhanistan  is literally a bunch of warring tribes stuck in the middle ages that the United States had to force upon a government. We had to topple a government in Iran. Sure it's a shithole but it's no Afganistan.
"Not over on <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>.  never seen so many man bunned weak beta males melting down into a pool of jello.  It really is sad."
They are so mad their ally didn't cause any deaths.
That’s the understatement of the year.
I see lot of Americans be extremely anti USA on Reddit. It’s very sad.
i think that’s kind of a rude thing to say. there’s a lot of people concerned about this situation and how it will unfold.
"Are you concerned when a parent disciplines their bratty child? This is an overdue course correction. You should be applauding forceful deterrence, not quibbling over “what will the spoiled child do in response.”"
America and Israel would turn Iran to glass if it did anything even remotely provocative.
excuse me? i <em>should</em> be applauding forceful deterrence? i don’t believe i am obligated to praise any action because i’m told to.
i’m more of a carrot before the stick person anyways so i just disagree with you there.
"and, i didn’t say anything about the reaction, i just thought that original commenter was rude by degrading people that were upset about this whole shitty situation. cause it is a shitty situation that is and will effect a lot people and it’s not just “man bun whatevers” that are concerned."
and you know i think that’s really stupid to relate the US iran relationship to a parent having to discipline a bratty child. i believe in nation sovereignty regardless. if a nation decides to be hostile against others than action is required. but to have the mindset that some other nation requires discipline from daddy USA is fucking disgusting. you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking that way.
"This ain’t about American ideals being imposed on poor Iran. It’s America making clear that belligerent warmongering countries won’t be tolerated. I don’t think we care what Iranians preach, think, or do. Have fun with that. Wanna hate America? Great. That’s even built into the DNA of our own country — burn our flag, fellow citizen, it’s your free speech right. But you, fellow sovereign nation, wanna mess around and lash out at others? Plan attacks against us? Abuse your own people to the point it can no longer be overlooked? Yeah, expected a swift kick in the ass."
Act like a child. Get called a child. You don’t get to define “your truth.” There is “the truth” and sometimes that means you gotta look in the mirror. This isn’t a reference to anything about Iran positive or negative other than to say they’ve been unnecessarily belligerent for years and we’ve now reminded them who the superpower is at the table.
i’m more of a carrot before the stick person anyways so i just disagree with you there.
Then what is your complaint right now?  Because Iran's been consistently aggressive and confrontational for DECADES and I'm pretty sure that the offer of a nuke deal and billions of dollars was the best carrot ever.
I mean ... come on.  The carrot doesn't work with Iran.  They see the carrot as weakness and encouragement that their bully techniques work.
This situation has been planned for since Bush daddy was in office.
Everything is going according to plan.

Dozens of missiles and not a single kill? Amazing. I'm willing to bet the Allayatouah called up Trump personally to make sure the target area was clear. He just needed to put on a little show for his homies so they wouldn't think he was weak. Trump understands how to deal with macho posturing and he played his hand masterfully.
4D Chess master!
This seems to be the case and Trunp has been very patient in forgiving Iran for a lot of transgressions until the lives of Americans were taken and that seems to be his red line in the sand. Iran doesn't want an all out war with the US any more than Trump does so the Ayatollah said he'd respond and he did but didn't officially cross the red line so both countries can safely and justifiably take a step back from the edge.
I had my doubts that trump would be able to successfully navigate all the ins and outs of politics but he really doesn't disappoint. Best president in my life time for sure.
"Oh, they didn't think that one out did they?"
Fucking cunts. We should put then in a room with 10 feminists as punishment.
"Or put them to work firefighting in the most hard hit areas where the fires are burning out of control. If they like fire, they should get a close look."
No thats probably what they want. A shockingly large number of arsonists (in australia and the U.S.) are firefighters in volunteer departments who want to be seen as heroes. They set fires because they're bored and want the recognition that comes with saving people from fire.
"If theyre under supervision, I really dont care.  They should have an ankle monitor and be on prison work release helping to put out fires. Even more so if they are already trained in firefighting.  They need to go right to the front lines where the fires are the most out of control, and if they dont survive the ordeal, so be it, they can join the rest of the people that died in to those fires and explain to them why they did it when they get to whatever afterlife awaits us, if any."
But they want the thrill and heroism of fighting fire. You are thinking like a rational person. Arsonists are not. They like the thrill and excitement of putting fires out hence why they set them.. For the thrill. Its a strange addiction. Look it up... Firefighter arson.
"Im well aware of the phenomenon, but the problem is nullified when everyone around them knows their secret and they have a tracking device strapped to their ankle.  They need all the help in those areas they can get, and these scum can do more good putting out the fire than they can sitting in jail.  They can return to jail after their community service is over if they survive."
[removed]
You go right ahead and show us how its done.
Well that would be a crime. I’ll let the authorities handle this one. Not much choice is their.
Notice they never said <em>why</em> they lit the fires...
We charge Climate Change with crimes? Whoa. 
/s
"Chain them all together in a chain gang,make them put the fires out,then feed them to the poor animals that survived these terrible fires of there own making"
"Unlike Obama, Trump didn’t assassinate a US citizen. That’s the only way this would be comparable."
"￼I mean, so was killing one of their generals. But so was their attack on our embassy and countless other acts of aggression."
Her polling firm hasn't informed her of her opinion yet.
She is a screaming example of why we need term limits in the house and senate.

Finally
"HR 5, the Equality Act which passed in the House (on close to a pure party line vote) will supersede any such State laws if passed by the Senate. It mandates inclusion of anyone self-identifying as trans, no matter the transition status, with no test of validity of the claim, in any activity as an expansion of the Civil Rights act. It also mandates allowing access of anyone to the facilities of the gender they identify at that moment: pools, locker rooms, saunas, whatever.  We've seen men claiming trans status dominate in several sports already, like field and track, weightlifting. There can be a powerful motive beyond just medals and acclamation: e.g. an elite but also-ran male golfer could declare as female to snag the $1 million US Women's Open prize, or in tennis  the $4.75 million prize from the Shiseido WTA Finals in Shenzhen, or at least stand a better chance of taking home some of the prize money. "
Hope your Senators read the bill before they vote.
This is probably prepping for the 2020 Olympics where this trans phenomenon will be put to the test for the first time.
It's going to probably be part of the presidential debates. Hold onto your butts.
"Current guidelines, which were modified in 2015, state that transgender female athletes can compete in women’s sports as long as their testosterone level is kept under 10 nanomoles per litre for at least one year prior to the competition and throughout the period of time they will be competing."
There is no fucking way that humanity will ever tolerate trans people stealing many of the womens competitions metals.
"Yeah I don't think it will actually happen, just will be tried."
"Any idea of there are any Olympic athletes set up to test the issue? Any sports we should watch for this Summer? I imagine it wouldn't be more than handful, but if it happen... it'll be a show."
"Nah, I had heard about this from someone else in a conversation in a bar, I think lol"
"My guess is it will be as few as one. But that's all it will take. Even one person who is trying to qualify but disqualified due to hormones, etc. Could get interesting."
"Ah, here we go:"

"From what I'm seeing, keep an eye on Laurel Hubbard. M to F transition from NZ who has been winning a lot of weightlifting awards. That's probably the person most likely to qualify, though there are others."
I believe he quit weightlifting after the media backlash as it was very obvious that it’s was just to improve results
Ummm... ma’am...? Your tests came back high for testosterone...  ummm... are you on steroids?  
Maybe it’s maybeline!
"It is already happening, but maybe in reverse.  Look for the girl's Texas High School wrestling championship. Mack Beggs has to compete with the females, although Mack has been transitioning to male for a few years via testosterone, steroids and other hormones. Mack had a 32-0 record and won back-to-back girls state championships, although Mack wanted to compete with the males. <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-texas-wrestler-wins-second-high-school-girls-title-n851106"">source</a>"
"Could just be your assigned gender and none of this would be an issue.  Buy no, we can't be rational."
I can’t blame the kid in that situation.
"It probably should be set up with a “girls” and “open” category. I’m sure that wouldn’t pass Title IX, but any trans kids are going to have an advantage over non-trans girls."
Should have been disqualified for juicing. The whole thing was a disgrace.
I can’t wait till it’s on a stage like the olympics and everyone can see how preposterous it is.
Hopefully everyone would just wake up
Honestly I think it would be hilarious
"There will be <em>massive</em> control over this issue at the Olympics from organizers and media. Trans athletes will be lionized as portraits in bravery before they ever compete, and I will not be surprised if there are sanctions against anyone who gripes about it publicly."
"Of course, but afterwards when everyone of them makes new world records and female born competitors are now obsolete it’ll sink in that this is ridiculous"
I agree. There will be a lot of arrangements quietly made behind closed doors to prevent it from happening again.
I’m hoping that women will be outraged and it’ll pop off in the media
I wonder if it's best to let this insanity go on so it destroys itself quickly. When woman's sport at the Olympics is dominated by men from Western countries. It'll be very evident it's not fair and I would assume plenty of non western countries will just drop out of the olympics.
It won't pass the Senate.
I can already see the headlines
Republicans United Against Equality Act
<em>And that's a bad thing</em>
"Why do you think the D's picked that name? 
Shows one of the dangers of legislators who don't read what they are voting on."
I hope they read the Constitution before they sign as well.
There's some pretty damned clear language in there on the subject.
"How does Congress have the power to legislate on this subject...? Sexual orientations are not covered by the equal protection clause, to my knowledge."
"<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5"">HR 5</a>, the Equality Act, is an expansion of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, expands the definition of public accommodation to include virtually every place, every gathering and event, and includes removal of all religious exemptions."
This is an abomination. If this monstrosity passes conservatives have conserved nothing. Maybe the interests of some megacorporations. But on social issues...
"Do these motherfuckets understand that it will protect pedophiles? They will just say that their sexuality is ""adults attracted to children"" and they will be protected!"
They are fully aware of that. How else can they protect those like Creepy Uncle Joe?
Only if they have Voter ID done and 2nd Amendment protections enshrined into their State Constitution. Also mandatory maximums in place on income tax/sales tax enshrined in their State Constitutions as well.
I don’t frankly give a damn right now about this with Democrats targeting our rights the way they are. This is a convenient distraction about a very very tiny minority.
"Does that also prevent mentally ill women on testosterone from unfairly competing against women who aren't ""juicing?"""
Good point
So strange that conservatives have become the champions of women's athletics.
"If there's a scholarship for women or a competition involving only women, then men (even ones who think they're women) shouldn't be involved."
Feels like I'm taking crazy pills
Paywall.
Only five eh?
"Good, it’s about time."
That's the correct thing to do.
This shouldn't even have to be a thing. This should be the most common of sense
Ridiculous that it’s come to this. How can anyone argue that men should be able to compete in women’s sports?
Unpopular opinion: We shouldn’t be legislating this stuff. Men shouldn’t compete in women’s events and that’s up to event organizers. They may choose to enforce that rule or risk alienating their fans. 
More freedom not more laws.
I’ve got a much better use for their time.
I wonder how much this was influenced by that South Park episode?
Paywalled. Which five?
"I sincerely want a real life juwanna man.  Imagine 6'5”, 220lb dude with a 40"" vertical, transitioning and playing in the wnba and just dominating.  Maybe then, liberals will see that their are physical differences between men and women."
"This is amazing. Trans individuals need their own designated categories, otherwise ""transwomen"" will continue to push bio women out of the way. There have been many records taken by transwomen away from bio women simply because their logic is, ""Transwomen are women"". This article makes me so happy."
"They are such a miniscule minority that they shouldn't even have a category. 0.6% of the population doesn't deserve so much attention. If you take a hormone treatment, you forfeit your right to compete in professional sports, simple as that."
"If we have to <em>legislate</em> this, we are already doomed."
I don't understand? I thought we were all equal now.
"How low have we sunk that our legislators have to legislate this? Men should be competing in men's sports and women in women's sports, it can't get more simple than that, but apparently progressives are even simpler people"
My 12 quick key points on the Gay/Transgender agenda...
"1/ Humans: XX or XY - that is it (there are some very rare abnormal situations, but these are a statistically deviant)."
XX or XY is 99.83% XXY 0.1% XYY 0.05% X 0.03% (minor rounding)
XYY are not even pathological (rather slightly more masculine) and X/XXY are un-mistaken female
​
​
2/ Men signing up for women's sports team will destroy women's sports as males have a different physiology that gives a strength and performance advantage.  This is complete foolishness.
​
​
3/ Transgender is a fantasy 
No amount of drugs or surgery will make men ovulate or women produce sperm 
We don't get to choose our chromosomes
​
"3a/ Boys have a penis, girls have a vagina. It’s just that simple. "
​
​
4/ FYI CISgeneder is fabricated; the correct term is NORMAL
I.e. statistically CISgeneder=NORMAL; everything else is abnormal 
This is scientifically factual (statistically and biologically)
"Also ""Heteronormativity"" is also simply normal humans, the rest is perverted aberrations"
​
​
5/ Gay is not biological... 
"<a href=""http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/executive-summary-sexuality-and-gender"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/executive-summary-sexuality-and-gender</a>"
"The understanding of sexual orientation as an innate, biologically fixed property of human beings the idea that people are ""born that way"" is not supported by scientific evidence."
​
​
6/ This whole transgender thing actually has zero to do with transgenders. 
"The rabid left don't care about equality, or rights for transgenders, etc. "
"The more divisive issues the rabid left can create, the more we are divided. "
It's all about division.
​
​
"7/ We must recognise #Tolerance is NOT #Acceptance (I tolerate, but don't celebrate or even accept the non binary or gay views)"
Sex/Gender is defined as the biological and anatomical differences between M&amp;F as determined at their birth
All the rest is mental illness (Gender dysphoria etc.). Get help!  Seriously!
​
​
8/ Children have the right to two parents; one of each gender so they have both a father and mother model.
"Also, Western values means maintaining the divinity of the individual, which group essentialism (intersectionality) does not."
​
​
"9/ Scientists have uncovered ~6,500 genetic differences between males and females that relate not only to the sexual organs, but surprisingly to other organs such as the brain, skin, and heart"

"Ah, so you want them to be assholes to other people, gotcha."
"Anyone else think we are taking a giant step backwards with shit like this. Not only is it overtly racist, but rather than telling people to be better, it's actually asking people to be worse versions of themselves."
"Nah, it's just to these actual racists, everything a white person does pisses them off. "
.
math = racism
It's not about white people being nice.  It's about white people being happy.
"Which is kinda worse because they actively want people to be ""unwell"" or ""miserable"". That's kinda fucked. Like, as long as you're not fucking people over or doing anything illegal, then you should genuinely want people to prosper and be happy. You have a fucked head if you want otherwise."
"Well, they do want people to be unwell <em>and</em> miserable. But you can't forget the most important factor: they want people to be <em>groveling</em>. "
"It's not enough to just give in and say ""Okay, okay, two plus two equals five"". They won't be satisfied until two plus two equals whatever they tell you it equals."
"They don't want solutions, they want to be angry"
It's OK to be white.
WTF is wrong with these people. 
Literally everything us white people do is a sign of white supremacy to them. Good lord.
Because maybe <em>they</em> are the racists?
Is this a joke?
"Sadly, no. I at first suspected that this was satire but it turns out it is a real Leftist outlet that likes to whine about how anything and everything is a form of ""white supremacy."""
real Leftist outlet 
"So yes, it is a joke."
"My first thought was, ""You've got to be kidding!"" But I'm afraid they're not."
"20 years ago, I would not have thought it possible, but these pinheads have so abused and overused the word ""racist"" so as to make it meaningless nonsense."
"As anyone who is even vaguely conservative has learned, ""racist"" is the first word out of a leftists mouth if you disagree with them in any way."
I just ignore them and go on with my life. You can't teach a pig to sing.
"<a href=""https://literallyracist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://literallyracist.com/</a>"
"Right, because how can we continue with the racist narrative if white people are nice to everyone all the time?"
"<a href=""https://twitter.com/Race2D"">https://twitter.com/Race2D</a> "
Whole twitter feed is full of racist people....🤦‍♂️
"On the plus side, this shows how little white supremacy there actually is. Demand outstripping supply."
"There actually may be a point in there. I've noticed in lots of places that ""civility"" can be used to bully people or squash dissent. Some of the rudest bs can be spewed in a very ""civil"" manner, and then you can get squashed for calling people on it with a simple ""hey, keep it civil"". I've always associated that mentality with liberals (rightly or wrongly). Very common in college and in office politics."
"I don't see the need for racist bs though. That kind of behavior, much like ""crybullying"", is not limited to a particular race."
Well if someone on twitter says
"""I just hate white people, I'll think of a reason later."""
This is more accurate.
"So being nice is now a qualifier for white supremacy.....I swear, you can't make this shit up. Literally would have expected something like that from the Bee or Onion, but frighteningly enough people out there actually think this way."
Crimes of 20th century white supremacists:
Crimes of 21st century white supremacists:
"If any of the 21st century makes it into history book a century from now, we will literally be the laughing stock and butt of every joke in history classrooms across the world."
"When you understand the victim mind, you understand that there is never an end to the guilt of everyone else."
"So does this mean if a white woman is a total bitch, she's not a white supremacist?"
"Better than being a jerk, I guess."
"Literally every conceivable thing a white person can do is considered racist, these people will openly tell you this when they say ""All white people are racist"""
"Go ahead guys, tell me how demographics don't matter and everyone is an individual."
Example:
"<strong>All white people are racist, because all white people exist in a racist power structure that we aren't actively fighting to dismantle.</strong> Racists don't just wear white pointy hats and say the 'n' word, by doing nothing, any and every white person is still taking advantage of a power structure that favours us. Don't be more upset with being called racist than actual racism. "
"If you're upset, do something - listen to the voices of people of colour, do your own research, give money, time or resources to spaces and platforms for people of colour. "

Which is more racist: 
"Believing that you are discriminated against is modern day slavery; it locks you into a degrading mental state where all you do is self pity and blame others instead of actively trying to better your situation, it makes you segregate yourself from other cultures and races, it makes you think your only redeeming quality is being black and not the effort you put into making yourself a successful individual, and the worst part about it is that your children inherit that state of mind. And for the record, Huffington Post is a shitty source."
Who are you talking to?
"Ho-Lee-Shit i just looked up the Race2Dinner website and its the most racist shit ive ever seen... in huge red letters: ""White Women: Stop focusing everything on you and your problems"" lol Jesus that's not even subtle..."
"They HATE white women. Their PO Box is apparently right next to my house, Hmmm i wonder if we can host one of their dinners?"
"I knew those Canadians were rotten, scheming, oppressive folk!!!"
I genuinely can't tell if that account is satire or not
I love how this is - somehow -  not considered horrendously racist.
"""Well, bless your heart."""
"I can’t wrap my brain around a connection between niceness and white supremacy but I think we need to tell women that being nice isn’t always the answer. It seems obvious but we’re so conditioned to be polite that many of us will enter a dangerous situation to avoid being rude! We actually need to be taught to listen to ourselves when we get a bad vibe, be safe even if that requires being weird or rude."
Wat
You guys really don't see it...
We are subjected to relentless psychological warfare every day
There is no ending to that mentality.  Either you realize and turn thw oposite way like many or keep sliding down  to darkness.
"Yknow...I’ve become incredibly hawkish about immigration if only for the fact that if we were a proud people and expected assimilation it would be fine but to invite people in and this is the shit that is pumped through the media, I really don’t like the idea of being a minority in a culture that shits on their every move. South Africa is the canary in the coal mine imo"
Nice is now racist.
Fuck me with a chainsaw.
I mean we were nice to the natives on Thanksgiving for a reason...
Easier to kill someone with their guard down.
Hahahahah
Thank you  for understanding that this is a joke. White people are just as sensitive as anybody else honestly. Bring on the downvotes. ☺️
Your handle isn't very funny.
"It’s a reference to a sketch from <a href=""https://youtu.be/hLOw_SzkRQ8"" rel=""nofollow"">The Chappelle Show</a> "
I’m from Silver Spring like Mr. Chappelle and we had a talent show rehashing the sketch with several twists. It was a good time in my life and I hold the humor of the people in this town very close to my heart. Seeing as how Silver Spring is consistently ranked as one of the most diverse cities in America I could care less what you think about it. Humor does not have to be universal because it is derived from cultural experience and if the people from my town are fine with it then that’s all that matters to me.
ClaytonBigsby would have been funnier.
To you. 
I can’t go back in time and tell grade school me to pick that sketch instead. It was what it was.
Too bad.  It was his best sketch with the Wayne Brady one coming in a close second.
"Make no mistake about it. Gervais is very left. He is NOT a conservative, but in this case of calling out hypocrisy he is spot on."
Enemy of my enemy 🤷‍♂️
A leftist that is pro-liberty and pro-free speech can be my friend or even ally even if we disagree on a number of other things.
"An actual liberal, not a communist in disguise."
"I’m on Reddit too much, I assume every liberal is a commie these days"
I used to think I was as liberal as you could be. Then the last 10 years happened and fuck me it's getting ridiculous.
"It's a safe assumption, to be fair."
"I hope you’re wrong, but it feels so right"
"Not sure why you're downvoted. Just go look at the ""liberal"" gun owners sub. I was banned because I said actual biological sex is not fluid or changeable. I wasn't even getting into the gender debate. I was told ""the trans experience is not up for debate."""
The guy above me was too. Commies in the sub probably.
Exactly
"30 years ago about the worst thing you could call someone was a liberal, because that was so far left it seemed unreasonable."
Leftists: Hold my kombucha.
Now liberals don't seem so bad.
"This. These people are trying to destroy society. Liberals just want the federal government to control more parts of life. We can disagree with them, but we have to stop the ones trying to destroy culture and language."
You might like libertarian socialists then
How is that not an oxymoron?
Socialism/Communism/ Leftism isn't inherently authoritarian. The term Libertarian actually came from French Socialists in the 1800's. 
"Essentially libsocs believe that it isnt neccesarily Capitalism that is the enemy, but actually  governments stronger than the masses and unjust heiarchies. "
"A Libertarian Socialist world is hard to envision, but essentially, it might look like a collection of highly Democratic interconnected ""communes"" with an emphasis on individual freedom and welfare systems that work a lot like voluntary charities."
"I'm not particularly convinced of its practicality and perhaps it's greatest weakness is that it may forsake productivity, as it seems that a clearly united whole usually has more power than loosely allied free states."
A libertarian world is hard enough to envision on it's own
"Fair, I wonder whether it's because we just haven't seen it on a global scale or whether the idea is just unrealistic to begin with."
This is a joke right?
Ok. I'm not a libertarian socialist. I'm just someone who believes in informing myself on all political ideologies. That's why I'm in this subreddit to begin with.
"If the idea of a different worldview is a joke to you, then I doubt you'd be willing to look at things through another perspective. "
"Identity politics and ignorance is the enemy of actual problem solving. If you have actual critique of libsoc ideology, I'd love to hear it and I'd likely actually agree with you."
Viewing everyone that disagrees with you as an enemy is childish.

"How are the left anti Hollywood/large corporations? They're the ones claiming to be ""woke""..."
[removed]
You'd be surprised how much everyone in these subs has in common.. 
Honestly I've been visiting these subs for a while and they all sound pretty much exactly the same. Only difference is the comments have a slant towards whatever the relevant political ideology. Besides that you can practically mad-lib the comments.
[removed]
"Very much this. Everyone agrees on the outcomes, but there's almost exactly a 50/50 split on how to get there."
"Nobody is born wanting a world filled with rape, murder, arson, abortion, war, famine, poverty, religious extremists, or natural disasters. What separates us is how we intend to create a world with the fewest instances, and yet somehow the opinions are diametrically opposed to one another."
I’m sure they are planning meetings this week to decide what to do about his refreshingly sane public assessment of their antics.
Regardless of political affiliation he is still hilarious just like Carlin was and Williams.
It's right wing because he is telling the truth
"This whole thing is bullshit. He had all that stuff written on the teleprompter and his ""speech"" was pee-planned and approved. Just like the rest of Hollywood, it was all acting."
I'm always so confused by how he is upvoted and shared by the exact people he is criticizing. Makes no sense.
The same window licking Redditors that are posting this over and over are the same retards he's making fun of.
Calling the Hollywood collective things like pedophiles and hypocrites rings true for the majority of people. Right or left.
Are you sure about that?
I think the Greta Thunberg joke gave context on exactly who he was talking about.
"I'm surprised they haven't labeled him a ""puppet of Putin"". yet."
Obviously he's a Nazi...
snorted on that one lol
I'm just going to get ahead of this one; 
"Jizzlobber42, the hero we need. your superhero costume would be funny as fuck"
your superhero costume would be funny as fuck
Let's just assume that I won't be wearing my underwear on the outside of my spandex leggings...
It's a faith no more song.
Telling the Lefties to Fuck Off with their politics might be the reasons.
There aren't many outspoken Republican stars that are going to make conservative speeches. Just kooky Liberals
"Adam Carolla said on Ruben Report that you can tell who is conservative in show business by who doesn't talk aboit politics. If they keep their mouth shut, chances are they lean right."
"I bet tons of celebrities who claim they are “left” aren’t actually liberal at all. They are actors, they just show it to get more fans and follower, I bet half of those guys are voting conservative anyways. They don’t want to pay taxes and the left sure as hell want to tax the rich."
"I mean logically yes, just the same way athiest muslims keep stum unless they want their head detached"
It’s not in their interest to make people vote left just so they can be more popular. I’d imagine at a certain point masquerading as a leftist would give less benefit as their fans vote more.
All he did was speak the honest truth and what almost all of America was thinking about Hollywood.
"I love how calling out elitist child fuckers, people who rape young actresses, and people who profit off of foreign sweatshops ""right wing"". "
"Never change Hollywood, you truly are a beacon of all that is good."
"The media calling out his criticisms of Hollywood as ""right wing"" solely because he is criticizing Hollywood is implicitly admitting that Hollywood is ""left wing"" and that only the right criticizes them for their pedophilia and hypocrisy."
As a left wing european the only time i was truly disgusted was travelling through california. The naked hipocracy gets under your skin
"At least in alabama they dont pretend to be what theyre not, in between the cousin fuckin o course"
[removed]
"When you're told that unless you have sex with someone you'll be blacklisted from the industry that's not an opportunity, that's coercion. It's like if your professor said that you need to perform sexual favors if you want to pass the course and get into grad school."
They're predators. They're disgusting. And they need the spotlight on them.
"Well that’s not really how it works, is it?"
"Yes, that's exactly how it works.  ...and it works the same way for child actors, with the willing participation of the parents."
Yeah but that’s school. Not the real world. The real world is ugly and beautiful. Buyer beware.
"It was a little of both. Reading about Epstein made it pretty clear. The vocal girls who were giving interviews and trying to get attention, like Giuffre, were definitely in that group you described."
Some of the other stories you read about the 15 and 16 year old girls from the people who helped them escape are really horrifying. These people are humiliated and you never hear from them.
I'm sure the deal is same with Weinstein.
"What you said definitely happened, I have no doubt in my mind. I also have no doubt in my mind that people were legitimately assaulted/raped as well."
I'm only surprised they arent calling him alt-right.

"Damn that chart is accurate. Just look at Tulsi Gabbard, who believes in free healthcare and college, but since she didn't vote for impeachment, she is a Republican now."
Maybe if he was American. I'm guessing his support back home is tremendous &amp; that's why they can't 'cancel' him
"He lives in New York. Also he's really not right wing, Just a comedian who gives zero fucks about PC culture."
And he's actually smart and funny.
Very funny.
"Just looked it up, he has a home in London too.  Point being is that he has absolutely nothing to worry about as far as his career.  He's pretty famous here in the US but he's untouchable in the UK.  Even if he was US canceled he could just fall back to only doing stuff in the UK.  Most of his shows do better there anyway."
"Oh he's set for life that's for sure, But he deserves i, A brilliant comedian and show writer. Check out his stand up specials if you haven't already."

Most English people are atheist now.
"Unlikely, since in the UK they actually criminalise free speech. Don't forget the whole Count Dankula thing."
"People on the left dislike large corporations and rich Hollywood elite as well. This doesn’t need to be politically divisive, I think what he was saying can be agreed upon by people from all across the political spectrum."
He’s not right wing but the right wing sure liked that monologue.
"Ricky Gervais is one of the left, and he doesn't view what he did as right wing at all. More evidence to what I'm thinking. The modern day left is in control and surrounded by echo chambers. They have no clue what those of us on the right actually want."
"The media and reddit especially has been demonizing conservatives for a long time now. They have been completely convinced that we don't support human rights for certain groups of people, like gays, POC, and immigrants. They consider themselves the saviors of these groups thanks to this warped perception."
"What, in your own words, does modern conservatism do to support the alphabet people, women’s reproductive rights, people of colour, and immigrants? Serious question."
"Human rights. I can’t speak for all conservatives but I believe in equal human rights, not special treatment. Those equal rights extend to all legal, law abiding American citizens and legal immigrants. The alphabet people are normal citizens, and while I don’t support gay marriage I don’t support anti-gay movements either. Abortion laws are complicated since it depends on when you consider a fetus to be human, and when human rights apply to them. Legal immigrants are good, illegal immigrants are bad. People of color are just normal people. Those are my personal views and they don’t apply to all conservatives."
It has been shown very clearly that conservatives understand liberals far better than liberals understand conservatives.  Jonathan Haidt (another reasonable lefty) describes it well:  
"<a href=""https://theindependentwhig.com/haidt-passages/haidt/conservatives-understand-liberals-better-than-liberals-understand-conservatives/"">https://theindependentwhig.com/haidt-passages/haidt/conservatives-understand-liberals-better-than-liberals-understand-conservatives/</a>"
Anything truthful or factual is closer to the right than left
And anything that pays attention to history.
"I never understood ""right wing talking point"" is that just something they say to try and completely dismiss any right wing ideas like it's invalid or something?"
"The greatest trick the leftists ever pulled was convincing people that conservatives are racist intolerant bigots, and ""right wing talking points"" is an extension of that."
"I think people who use the phrase ""right wing talking point"" are under the impression that the vast majority of americans recognize ""right wing"" as an insult. By that logic, calling any idea a ""right wing talking point"" would be discrediting it."
"This reaction to Gervais by the left is typical. Brand him as right wing to give moral reason to exclude him from the public square, and thus cut off legitimate criticism of the left. The left really needs to have some kind of check and balance on their excess, and a comic is likely to be the easiest of these pills to swallow. Laugh it off, and improve rather than get all huffy and start trying to silence criticism."
"he isn't a ""right-winger"" just for calling out the insane hypocrisy of hollywood.  I cringe so much when I see pragerU capitalizing on him on facebook like he is some conservative savior..."
"Never heard of this Marc Harris guy before this article, but he sure is a pussy."
"Gervais : ""acceptance speeches about bravery and political statements are shit """
"Left Media rebuttal : "" your speech wasn't brave and it didn't make any political statements """
Do they really not fucking get it yet?
"I absolutely loved what he had to say that said... Its pretty weird to be honest I kind of seen it as a bit of a u-turn as from what I had seen of him on the subject he is pretty left leaning anyway, he has done a few of those lefty, moaning, cringey videos himself, So I was surprised to see he had said all of this...I found it pretty awkward tell you the truth but thats for sure what he was going for!"
The left is eating the left - that's what we're seeing.
You can only play along and pretend with them so long until you realize how insufferable they are.
"Just look at the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moWe3rk7LzQ&amp;t=10s"" rel=""nofollow"">democratic socialist convention.</a>"
"All my left wing friends love Ricky.  It's really the so called moderate left, that are the pro corporate democrats that hate Ricky for calling them out on their hypocritical bullshit."
"Take a look at the comments in similar titles in <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> and <a href=""/r/news"" rel=""nofollow"">r/news</a> .... hilarious!"
Well they’re his fucking friends.
"It is Left, center and right wing talking points.... Hollywood Elites are just on their own here."
"I believe the speech was planned and approved. I believe the powers  behind the Hollywood machine are telling their puppets to stand down and  shut the fuck up, and doing it on such a public platform was a strategic move. The majority of the public is pissed, and they have  pushed us too far. Even Obama has stated that the far left needs to  reign it back in.  They meant to slowly bring the frogs to boil, but  instead turned the heat on high and the frogs are jumping out"
"Um, violating the precepts of the Church of the Left is indeed heresy; heresy results in name calling, and the most evil thing a leftist can consider is someone who is ""right wing,"" let the name calling begin. "
The left is incapable or disinterested (or both) in discussing ideas or events; all they apparently consider is the person. 
A pro-liberty and pro-free speech leftist would actually be a liberal...
"It's pretty strange how liberals have changed over the last few years. Ricky is for sure what I'd have called a liberal when I was young. Kind of cut from the same cloth as George Carlin. Anti authoritarian, pro freedom, pro free speech."
Now liberal seems to mean angry mobs that want people who disagree canceled. Crazy Antifa types randomly lashing out violently. Plus a serious shift towards socialism and communism.
There is no right wing or left wing anymore in mainstream politics.
"Neoliberals and neoconservatives are cut from the same globalist/corporatist cloth. They only disagree on the proper path toward stripping individuals of their identity and concentrating power in the government and the wealthy. Anyone who speaks out against the Globohomocorp is labeled either a right wing shill by democrats or a bleeding heart by republicans, depending on their audience and which part of Globohomocorp they're attacking."
"Yeah, all these people are calling Gervais a right wing shill because he went to a venue packed with Democrats and made some snide remarks about their slice of Globohomo. Republicans would be calling him a whiny bleeding heart if he hosted the whitehouse correspondents dinner and made jokes about police abuse of power, the corruption in military spending/procurement, corporate lobbying power, or the fact that the Republican Speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007 was a child molester."
"Like I said, there is no longer a left vs. right. That's all theater. The real battle is between the global elite and the independent-thinking Western individual, because independent thinkers are difficult to control and exploit."
"The tweet bugged the hell out of me. Like, you're in a room with a boatload of the richest people, 99% of whom are leftist, and you're calling out the biggest companies in the world, all of which are leftist, and you still associate rich and ""corporation"" with ""right wing"". Like, I wish you would take some time to <a href=""https://www.heritage.org/truenorth"" rel=""nofollow"">read something like this</a> and realize that even if you disagree with some of it, you're probably a lot closer to it than you realize."
"You think rich people and elites are leftist? The wealthy use the Republican party for tax cuts, and that's it. They do not care about social issues. Wealthy people and corporations support Republicans."
"Sure, they use the Republicans for tax cuts and aren't particularly right wing. They also use the Democrats for strategic tax <em>hikes</em> and regulatory capture to prevent competition. Go look at the execs of Disney, Apple, and Nike and tell me who they donate too. I'll guarantee it ain't Republicans."
I'm sure the wealthy and corporations donate to both Republicans and corporate Democrats. That's how the bribery in our system works. That's why I vote for neither.
Shows you how far left the average leftist is when he’s viewed as right-wing
"Sometimes the truth is a hard pill to swallow.   Good on him, Hollywood is full of sick people and other people who know how sick they are and do nothing about it."
"I'm cool with him saying he's not right-wing if it helps get our message out to people who would otherwise not listen. But his speech sounded like an <a href=""/r/The_Donald"" rel=""nofollow"">r/The_Donald</a> post word for word. That's why it was so awesome."
Classic left wing trying to label people who don’t agree with them
"In a few years, true classical liberals will wake up and vote Republican.... Not because we share the same beliefs/values, but because they will no longer have a place in their current party."
They usually call you racist or something when they disagree.
"Hahaha... Its not! This is exactly what we are dealing with, with Hollywood and by extension the modern day American left. This is how far off the reservation the left has gone. "
"In normal times, with normal politics, this would be exactly what it is (making fun of the rich famous elites in Hollywood). However in ridiculously abnormal times, in a political world, where you have extreme deranged leftists, all over Hollywood and the media, it's ""right wing"". "
"So making fun of millionaires is right wing now?? Huh, that's funny. I guess someone forgot to tell Bernie and his supporters that😂"
Give me a fucking break! Like seriously.
"What he is is a clear example of the difference between ""liberalism"" and ""progressivism"". Ricky Gervais is clearly a liberal. He called out progressive attitudes, and that's the *problematic* part."
Brierbart isn’t a news source.
They blame it on climate change despite the fact that 183 people have been arrested with arson charges since November. Also the fact is it’s been an incredibly dry year and I know not just near me but many areas around greater Sydney were against it wanted reduced back burning. So you have like near me 6 years of bush building up and 1 really dry year it all goes up. Long story short socialism wouldn’t fix dry weather and shitty policy
Iran in last few weeks:
Murders 1500 of their own protesting citizens
Kills US Contractor in attack 
Attacks US Embassy
Terrorist general and militia leader killed in drone strike
Shoots missiles at Iraqi Base / US Troops (no deaths)
Threatens to bomb Israel and UAE
Pledges to develop nukes
50 Iranians killed (250 injured) at General’s funeral in a stampede???
Major earthquakes shake Iran. Worries about it damaging near nuclear facilities. 
"Ukrainian Civilian Plane seemingly shot down by Iran after takeoff (170+ killed). Cause unconfirmed, they claim it’s a mechanical failure. "
"Is it physically possible for this to get more retarded? 
Will the Ayatollah slip on a banana peel?"
Iran has been retarded for the last couple decades.
This comes a day after a threatening tweet by the Iranian president.
"""Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655,"" Rouhani tweeted, referring to the 1988 <strong>shooting down of an Iranian airline</strong> by a U.S. warship in which 290 were killed. ""Never threaten the Iranian nation."" <a href=""https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/rouhani-tells-trump-remember-the-number-290-1.1578385178334"">[1]</a>"
Pretty weird timing.
I saw some footage taken by an Iranian civilian on his phone — it’s literally a fireball falling out of the sky. Looked terrible. And it took a good 30 seconds or so to hit the ground. Just awful way to die.
"""... caused by mechanical issues."""
"Yeah, like, you know. The mechanics that keep the plane from flying!"
"AKA, terrorism."
It was more likely they shot it down thinking it was a US military plane.
Iran are looking bat shit insane at this point.
Or they had their ADA systems up incase of some instant retaliation after their late night show there and didn't shut them down in time. I dont know. I feel awful for Ukranians as they've had the worst of it on civilian airline side of things in recent memory. RIP to the passengers and crew no matter what cause it.
"Might be this one <a href=""https://ibb.co/xFS9WpB"">https://ibb.co/xFS9WpB</a>"

"I don't know, making assumptions jumping to (false) conclusiosn without any proof or investigation.. that what commies do. Do you want to be the same?"
"it is a tragedy for the families, will be investigated by many sides. the truth will come out most likely pretty quickly."
let's not jump to conclusions and point fingers yet.
That can't be random.
Iran likely shot it down so that they could then blame us for shooting it down.
I think they took out some passenger(s) on purpose.
And you know that our 5th column will believe it.
No coincidence it’s another Boeing 737. Could be Iran trying to hurt U.S. markets
What are the odds? Next to zero plane crashes happen a year. and one happens to crash in Iran tonight?
"No matter the odds, it’s sad those people lost their lives."
My thoughts exactly
[deleted]
Good lord. What are the odds Iran finds a way to blame the US? Or is this off-limits? 
"I’ve got a bad feeling that Iran will say this was US retaliation, giving them the leeway to escalate. This might not be reasonable however because the Regime knows war with the US would end poorly."
My guess is Iranian air defenses on high alert who misidentified it as a US military plane.  Iran will never admit this though.
"Damn, this got really really dark"
It’s a Ukrainian plane with several Russian nationals on board.  Russia may not care that Iran doesn’t admit it...
"If true, it still ends any practical chance of Russia intervening. This is horrific for them."
Russia was *never* going to go to bat for Iran against the US.  It is pure folly to think Putin is that stupid.  Iran has exactly zero friends.
"Yeah but at this point, Iran’s not getting anything, no second hand tanks, missiles, AK’s. It’s over, the tap is closed, the oil wasn’t that great anyways, bing bang, Iran’s roasted like chestnuts"
Oh that’s exactly my point.  Russia was never going to help them through anything more than political channels but now?  Now Putin might be sharpening his bear hunting knife... you don’t want that if you’re Iran.  Putin isn’t Trump and Moscow isn’t Washington.  When you factor in Iran threatened Dubai for no reason as well today it’s clear that they’re going even more insane than usual.
"And the other factor, China is too busy concluding Phase I and to be blunt, murdering and imprisoning their own Moslems. Iran is all alone here."
Which is why I found it funny when leftists were saying China would use nukes to defend their “strong ally” Iran if need be.  China doesn’t want mutually assured destruction because they’re not insane and they also don’t seem to have any love for Muslims anyway so why would they help them fight a self-proclaimed holy war?
Chinas nuke policy has always been self defense and second strike.  They would never use them to defend an ally.
China is like the mafia — they’d rather shut up an ally who is rocking the boat and interfering with business than go to bat for them.
"Iran's leadership immediately came out saying that the cause of the crash was a mechanical issue.  Don't they understand it takes some time to figure out how an airplane crashed?  I'm assuming that someone important was on that airplane, and Iran shot it down."
I just don’t believe this was an accident
"Alleged video of plane on fire:  <a href=""https://twitter.com/alihashem_tv?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"">https://twitter.com/alihashem_tv?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a>"
"What kind of podunk operations do they have at Iranian airports that they’re estimating the casualties? There’s a thing called manifests, tf?"
"Crash is obviously due to a missile, lots of shrapnel holes visible in official pictures, video of plane on fire in the air. "
"Iran claiming way too quickly that it’s “mechanical fault” suggests they know that they shot it down. If it was possibly a US missile, they’d be quick to push that line."
"Iran nuancing claim now by specifying engine fire and loss of control - but a competent pilot can deal with an engine fire on a 737NG, and they’ve also admitted their was no contact from pilot so they would have no way of knowing ie they’re very obviously bullshitting. "
"95% chance it was iranian air defence on the ground that misidentified this as an enemy military aircraft. this should NOT have happened given the location (climbing directly out of your major airport),  but it seems that someone fucked up big time."
Boeing getting in the game now?
I wonder how many politicians that oppose war were on that plane.
"Seems to me like pointing out that there might be a leak in the Titanic after it is already sitting at the bottom of the ocean.  These sorts of biases have been a problem for a long time at universities.  Any field that isn’t what I would call hard studies, which I mean is grounded in hard facts, like physics, mathematics, etc...  requires regurgitation of opinion more than any kind of critical thinking.  That was the case when I was in school 20-25 years ago.  "
The fact that it is the same or worse today isn’t a surprise nor is the fact that they would use technology to further their aims of “education”.
"Today I am in a position where I would advise my children to answer questions from teachers based on what you know they expect, not what you know to be right.  The professors of my day wanted to seem open minded in their criticism of conservative and traditional values, but to criticize them was asking to be punished.  The “education” I got from them was mostly a joke, an expensive joke to be sure, and necessary for the piece of paper that is more valuable than what is learned in attaining it."
"So long as we allow progressives to keep control of our universities and, more important, our primary schools, they are going to win the war regardless of the battles they lose along the way."
"They only have to wait for the next generation, or at most the one after that, to reach adulthood and they will have created a people that will willingly give up what could never be taken by force. "
"President Trump's actions with the courts is a necessary first step, but it's not close to sufficient.  He has to force a shift in the outlook of the education system in much the same way he's shifted the philosophy of the courts.  Progressives have been working towards this since Dewey.  Their biggest victory so far was creating the DoE in 1979.  They were on the verge of victory when the American people woke up.  "
But they have only had a setback.  Every time they backpedal an overreach without any real consequence they regain a bit of that lost ground.
That this has to be legislated is an indicator of the tawdry state of things. When will conservatives bite back?
When we grow a pair.
Liberals are shocked that people are expected to play sports in the same division as the gender they were born as. More at 11.
Well that’s just racist
Restoring fairness and integrity to women's sports. Hopefully this gains the traction it needs.
Amen
Striking a blow for feminism.
"Well, for radical feminism. Somehow to liberal feminists this is sexist but I'm not high or drunk enough to explain why."
Not at all
It's ensuring women have a right to participate in fair sports.
"So it’s a good thing for feminism, or are you just illiterate?"
"Yes, it's a good thing for feminism."
It's a good thing for women. The two are not the same.
Striking a blow for feminism
“For” is different than “to”. Who’s illiterate?
Still you
Good idea.
lol and conservatives say they want the government to mind its own business 
y’all wild
They do want the govt to stay out of things. Which is why all those laws is all those cities that make it ok for this to happen are fought against.
That's the inaction fallacy
"You do realize the logical fallacy of what you just said, right? Probably not, so let me help you. It already IS ok unless someone (e.g., people like you) claim it isn't. It's not like there is some fundamental Law of Physics that says someone with ""female"" written on their birth certificate cannot play men's soccer. You and others like you just like to pretend there is. Why the fuck do you even care so much? Who gives a shit if someone with ""female"" genitalia wants to live their life as a man? Mind your own fucking business and leave other people alone."
"That's not the issue. In most sports, males have the distinct advantage."
"The issue is when people born male claim as and play sports as female, they still have the physical edge up on all of the other people with female genitalia and hormones."
Should I be able to be go pro in any sport just because I am male and claim to be female?
"If a female was good enough to play in the NBA, I don't think anyone would stop them, nevermind the whole, ""claiming to be male"" thing."
"On the other hand should any D2 college male athlete be let into the WNBA just because they claim to be female? I have a feeling if this were a trend, the WNBA would be dominated by stars with bulges."
"In my opinion, it's a simple matter. You created female leagues for a reason (to make fair competition despite a biological disadvantage), so either uphold them and say you compete with your birth sex or do away with separate leagues all together. I think we know how the latter would go over."
We all have to be honest with ourselves that conservatives need to start using government power to support our side in helpful ways because we sure as hell know Democrats are itching to use everything at their disposal to destroy us.
Small government is really only desirable when everyone shares the same bedrock but Americans (and the tens of millions of immigrants inside the country) don't anymore.
Why should government interfere with who can play games?
"Because if it is handled by the league or organizer, there can be discrimination called on the organizer taking this stand. Now there is a lawsuit and the government is involved. If they want a sports league for both, they'll make a co-ed sports league."
This is more about keeping the government out and letting the league organizers handle it.
That's an interesting take I hadn't considered.
sexing not gendering.
Biological gender dummy
"Hmm, says mechanical issues, but obviously it's such a coincidence wouldn't be surprised if it was accidentally shot down."
Or sabotaged in some way
"All hands lost including 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghan, three Germans and three Brits. No Americans on board. "

Videos of the incident show the plane clearly on fire breaking up in mid-air. Bystanders on the ground wondered if it was a missile at first. There's a lot of speculation that Iran accidentally shot down this plane while its air defense systems were on high alert following the missile barrage.
"Gotta be deserters of Iran regime. Like East Berlin, you can't just up and leave when you want."
there shouldn't be signs with predictions on them in any government park. only facts.
"Seems like an easy update... Change ""will"" to ""won't."" You don't have to remove all of the signs and it turns speculation into fact. Saves money and doesn't lie."
Question though... Are we sure this wasn't just a clever marketing scheme to boost attendance prior to 2020...?
They’re just gonna send an intern around with a marker to change all the 2’s to 3’s. “Glaciers will be gone by 2030. Stop denying science”
“Glaciers will be gone by 3030”
only facts.
Sounds reasonable. New sign: 
"<a href=""https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/nature/melting-glaciers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Glacier national park: 9 of 35 Glaciers lost over 49 years, average total loss of 39%.</a>"
What an inconvenient truth.
"This shouldn't be controversial. It's 2020, we still have glaciers. These signs are as inaccurate as their predictions."
Conservatives should force those signs to stay up as a monument to liberal idiocy and hysteria over climate change and a reminder that the goalposts will continue to shift.
"I mean, the glaciers are absolutely disappearing. A prediction being off doesn’t invalidate the trend."
"n, the glaciers are absolutely disappearing. A prediction being off doesn’t invalidate the trend."
when?
"If an oncologist diagnoses you with cancer, but can’t predict the exact day you’ll die, do you ignore the diagnosis?"
"okay, im no doctor but your going to die. its a fact. apocalypse is going to happen. fact. the sun is going to no longer exist. fact. your clearly retarded. "
STOP BURNING FOSSIL FUELS AMERICA THE SUN IS GOING TO GO OUT!
Why don't you trust the computer models?
This..this is why we don't trust them.
"Computer models are built by humans to tell a story that they want told. Data is easily manipulated or ""adjusted"" for variables that then changes the entire story that the human wants told."
Source: I am a human that spends every day looking at data and doing predictive analysis.
Bahaha
What % of glaciers are going to be gone in 2020? Just wondering about the facts here.
"Considering we are at the last stages of an ice age, we should lose some every year."
"Just wondering if you knew the %, and if it is in line with regular warming or more likely accelerated by human caused factors. Basing your position regarding climate change on the existence of a park sign is quite foolish."
Yo moron.  What the fuck are you talking about?  A lot of assumptions about me there potato Head. Fuck off.
Just one assumption: that your brain is smooth.
When the signs imply that all of them would've been lost thats the fact
So you don't know whether the glacier loss is still outside a sustainable norm? You're just going to use the existence signs to justify your views? No further research needed?
tell that to the Forrest service that put up the signs

Oh yea 30-90% loss in size is totally just regular warming lol. muh park signs btw.
Username checks out.
At least something will have disappeared in 2020. Maybe they can get Al Gore to do the job.
"We'll hear people claim this is good because the public prevented losses. I already saw one mention that it was overestimated, as if the science was wrong."
Leading scientists said the glaciers would be gone by 2020.  These are the same leading scientists making all the other apocalyptic predictions for the planet that only rampant socialism can stop for some reason.
We could quit picking winners and losers in the form of billions of dollars of subsidies for oil and gas companies and allow green tech to compete in the free market. Seems pretty capitalistic to me. Most of the solutions I see being proposed for curbing our environmental impact have nothing to do with socialism.
"I'm not sure what you understand what ""subsidy"" means."
Teach me. What’s it called when the US govt gives billions of taxpayer-funded dollars to a petroleum company?
"Oil companies have some of the highest net tax rates in the world.  They do not receive any taxpayer money, they are taxpayers."

"The only legitimate one I see is the clean coal tax credits (and that is a ""green"" initiative).   The rest are standard and basic business practices,(ie. income-expenses = profit) used to come to a tax bill number.  They even call them ""indirect subsidies"" since they are just normal business accounting rules."
Climate change miscreants: <em>This just gives the anti climate change crowd more ammunition.</em>
"Nice deflection try. I’m a conservative, I believe in climate change. However, I refuse to listen to the ridiculous far left fear mongering. “The glaciers will be gone in 2020.” “The world is going to end in 12 years.” “We need to eliminate coal energy.” These ideas are now solidly set in the “progressive” sect of the democrat party. The ‘green new deal’ was the biggest piece of shit, policy wise, id ever seen scribbled on parchment. Ocasio Cortez is not just an unintelligent talking head, she’s a misinformed participant in this ridiculous agenda being forced down American throats. Whichever candidate endorses this policy should be burned at the stake."
"That's the problem I have with it.  Climate change is real (though I'm certain that humans aren't 100% accountable for it).  However, I won't buy into their narrative of, ""This is a crisis and we aren't even sure of how to reverse it. The one thing we do know, is that the only way we can fix it is for you to give us tens of trillions of dollars."""
PragerU found we are responsible for less than 5% of climate change
"i’d be hesitant to trust anyone that provides a definitive answer for exactly how much we’re responsible for. there’s a nearly endless list of variables that need to be taken into account, including many we barely understand."
Where did they publish their findings at? Would love to verify their peer reviewed works.
Who is the “us” that is asking for trillions of dollars? Most environmentally minded people I talk to are hoping people will eat less meat and take fewer plane trips. Maybe have fewer kids. I don’t see any one (I guess except politicians??) asking for trillions of dollars.
"Haha, idiots."
Aren't these products of the ice age anyway?  I imagine they've been melting long before the Secondborn of Ilúvatar awoke.
I went to that park a few years ago in the spring.  Place was so frozen over that only like the first couple miles of the park was open.  The rest of the roads were blocked by snow and ice.  So much for global warming.
"Went there last year with my parents who were there in the mid 90s. They had photos from back then and were actually shocked how much the glaciers have moved back. You know that glacier you can walk up to? We were more than 50 meters away from the current end when we passed the mark for the mid 90s end. I saw some before photos and what these glaciers look like now, the have shrinked immensely and multiple dont even fullfill the classifications for a glacier any more. The glaciers are disappearing, just not quite as fast as some initially expexted. And by the was, climate is defined as the wearher over long periods of time..."
"Glaciers have been generally shrinking since the start of the Holocene. Sometimes they grown, sometimes they shrink, but over all the trend is towards small glaciers.   That's a known fact.  The idea that humans are causing them to shrink and we can predict future shrinkage from human involvement hasn't been proven.  Rather the predictions made on that basis continue to be incorrect, proving that the theory people are working from isn't science, rather it's quackery."
"The greenhouse effect in all it's utter simplicity already oies a great way of showing why man-made climate change is a very real thing. The earth's energetic system is depending on radiation that is first reflected of the earth's surface and then by the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere. The larger the concentration of greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and Methane, the larger the share of radiation that is reflected back to the earth. More radiation means more energy, which in turn expresses itself through heat. It's actually very simple."
The greenhouse effect in all it's utter simplicity already oies a great way of showing why man-made climate change is a very real thing.
First the greenhouse effect from CO2 is very weak.  The original global warming is going to kill us all theory had a water vapor feed back system that greatly amped the heat increases from it since water vapor is a very strong greenhouse gas.  Problem was when we eventually got some climate monitoring satellites up they found no water feed back effect.  Global warming nutcases promptly forgot about this and never talked about it again.
"Secondly, there's a negative feedback loop from CO2 is offset by increased greening from higher levels of CO2.  Our current epoch has extreamly low CO2 compared to earlier epochs and as CO2 has gone up to more normal levels the earth has gotten a lot greener, this in turn increase the aerosols released by green plants which reflects more solar radiation back.  The actual temperature increases from CO2 has been lower than expected for this reason.  As CO2 levels continue to rise so will the greening effect which dampers heat increases from CO2."
"Finally Methane has a 7 year half life in the atmosphere.  Lots of Methane is bad, but it doesn't last that long.  Not a major issue."
Can´t believe people still denying climate change.
"For the ones complaining about how people that talks about this never provide scientific evidence (idk about yall but If I care to know about something I actually go search that up myself instead of waiting for someone to hand me all the answers), here's some interesting stuff."
Here´s a study from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - US) to establish if the warming of the 20th century was caused by natural forcings or human-caused ones:

Climate change is real - but did doggerland disappear because of caveman campfires?
I didn't deny climate change happens.  It's always happened.  What I pointed out is the people screaming about the earth is about to die have made the same wrong predictions for 30 fucking years.
But our models and our consensus!?!?!    /s
"Hahah, take your shit cult back to whatever Liberal College your parents sent you to. No place for it around here. You have the vastness of the internet to jerk yourself off with the rest of the Climate Cult myrmidons. This is where we come to make fun of you, so take off asshat!!!"
Prove to me climate change doesn’t exist and then I’ll change my mind.
"Okay. Go wait in the Quad with Sully and Max, I’ll be down after my Gender reassignment lecture. Gotta get an A or my pops will cut my tuition. Don’t forget your Hydroflask!!!"
I’ll ask again because clearly you didn’t understand the first time. Prove to me climate change doesn’t exist instead of making comments that have no relation to climate change.
"You were there before the park fully opened. Each year they open up the beginning segment of the road (typically Apgar to Lake McDonald) that they can clear faster than the segments that are at higher elevations. This is not new, and it is certainly not evidence or indication that global warming is not taking place or that glaciers aren’t diminishing."
"North pole is frozen every year, but every summer there's less and less ice. "
Glacier isn't different.
North Pole ice varries year to year and decade to decade.  You’re statement is a lie that someone told you.
"It does vary, yes. "
"The trend line in that variation is clear. If you don't believe in trend lines, that's ok. Math doesn't care what you believe."
You understand why they named it global right.?
You understand why they changed the 'warming' part right?
"Because people don't take it seriously, because they focus on the warning part. And the problem is rampant change. But the warning part stuck"
"Nah, they changed the word to 'change', because the warming 
predictions didn't pan out.  So any 'change' in the climate is attributed
to whatever they're trying to regulate/tax."
The global predictions have been just as wrong as the local predictions.  As a trained engineer I know that if a system doesn't produce accurate results locally it sure isn't going to produce is when you expand the scope.  Science is based on the ability to make accurate future predictions something the global scaremongering crowed has failed to do for 30+ years now.
"My bad. I'm not a trained engineer, so all I have to rely on is the scientific consensus. But it makes more sense in believing in fear mongering now a days I suppose. It's more comforting believing that the people trying to warn you is the same as the end is near guys, than it is that the people profiting on gas and oil have an accumulated wealth bigger than some countries and that they are not in favour of giving up a single iota of power. I'm just in favour of better safe than sorry. What's the worst that could happen? Cleaner metropolitan areas, less oil spills, less fucking over people living on natural deposits. "
"Plus it seems to me like clinging to something that is finite, while our demand for it gets bigger and bigger is gonna bite us in the ass."
I know I'm going to get downwoted tooblibion and that you can't change peoples minds once they are set. But I'm an optimist and I would like for us all to enjoy this little planet for as long as possible.
If they were truly concerned wouldn't there be an active plan for Bloomberg to move Manhattan away from the water?  DC further inland?  The richest and most powerful people are telling you it's imminent yet they're doing literally nothing. Not saying global warming is a farse but that's a fair cause for skepticism.
"I don't know anything about Bloomberg as I'm not an American, so I can only talk about what my country and he countries around me are doing. But there is a lot of movement in the green sector. Even China(!) is investing heavily in green energy. It's not that the European countries are smarter, I think it's because we are not as heavily involved with foreign oil and gas companies. 
Take Norway for example. They sit on a lot of natural oil. Like a lot and they have a lot of money per capita. But it's close to 100% of their energy is renewable. They're investing a lot of money in something that's not a finite resource. Wave generators for an example. "
"Even if it isn't destroying the climate globally, smog and pollution is still a thing. Even if you live in a small big city like me, 1 million, there's still a higher percentage of cancer. That's not coming from wind turbines or electric cars."
I don't disagree that renewable energy is the better long term bet. I'm actually keeping an eye on solar roof tiles so when they're reasonable enough I'll be redoing my roof.  
There is a difference being pro renewable energy and a climate change alarmist though. That's the point the majority on the right are making. That's the point I just made. If the seas we're rising and we're all screwed the rich amd powerful would be long gone from the coasts. It's not happening which means this is something being used for personal/political gain.  Don't be that puppet.
"I was once a chaperone for a group of elementary school kids on a field trip to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The Park Ranger was explaining the rock formations, and how they've changed over time. He then said that global warming (that was the buzzword at the time) was going to drastically change the shoreline of Lake Superior, even saying that the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would have a climate similar to St. Louis, MO within 15 years. This was back in the late 90s. I'm still waiting for the climate here to be like St. Louis."
"As we were walking back to the bus, I told the kids that this guy was insane, and that we would most certainly not live in a climate similar to St. Louis any time soon."
They should pass a law to make them unremovable.
Most glaciers are gone thou
"So he's just going to keep doing this, eh?"
"But, but he “apologized” for such behavior. He said he’s changed. "
Could he have been...<em>lying???</em>
<em>mild shock</em>
A Cone-Of-Shame is the only way to change his behavior.
I think Crowder did a skit on Biden doing that.
"""Consistency!"" Bzzzz! ""I am in charge!"""
"He has changed, he’s kissing black people now.  See how not-racist he is!"
Well he famously talked about how the black kids at the pool loved his leg hair.

His sexual harassment cant see color!
"Honestly at this point im thinking he's just naturally creepy/cringe. But maybe thats his staffs plan, have him keep doing this so it appears normal."
He’s ancient. I don’t know that many folks can fundamentally change in their 70’s.
"Besides, he's never used tongue."
give it time
LOL
"He can't feel guilt if he doesn't feel it is wrong, he sees nothing wrong with it."
"Just let it sink for a moment that if the one doing that, was anyone else besides a powerful rich democrat who is above the law, the metoo movement would have already made his boss fire him, vandalized his house, and ruined his life."
[removed]
"Why do democrats care more about talking shit, than this?"
"Find me one video of Trump being inappropriate with little girls, I'll wait."
"Because words = actions, right."
"Anyone other than a democrat,"
Anyone other than a democrat would not consider putting your hand around a woman who asked to take a picture with you a sexual offense.
"So while not only democrats do this kinds stuff, one would expect the ones preaching the metoo would adhere to their own rules."
"Also , you are really comparing Trump who has an entire security detail wherever he goes to most republican acting as mayors  ? Lol. Even so"

"Tell me, where is Biden's protests for this ? Where are the feminists saying he sexually offended her ?"
pretty sure dems hate biden worse than you do
So that's why he's.... leading the Democratic primary? Hol up I need to smoke something before trying to figure this one out.
"shoulda said 'libs'... the career democrats wanna put their own person up, and just like hillary, nobody i talk to in real life likes biden and are pissed that the media is lying. bernie is BY FAR leading those polls that really dont help see the future."
my state is a closed primary... the ONLY time i register with a d is when i wanna put my vote up against establishment dems.
"Ah so all those votes cast to hillary who was a democrat almost her entire life was just a big conspiracy and bernie, who is only a democrat when it means he's running for president is the <em>real</em> democrat. and all the people being polled are just liberal shills. and you know this because there are people you talk to in real life which must mean all the polling is just a bunch of establishment lies. "
"yea, i think you either need to back off the pipe or bernie's cock."
I’m not a feminist but I don’t understand the conservative whataboutist tactic of “but feminist don’t protest against Joe Biden”
"Yes feminists hate Joe Biden as you conservatives do, what’s your point then? "
We should focus on important things not just this “creepy Biden” boring endless story.
Great. A bush-dodger apologists
"Democrat does this = a kind gesture, not sexual. "
Republican does this = demoralizing women and degrading their rights. Pedophilia
I’d rather side with the man whose advances are consensual than the man whose advances are literally molestation
they let you do it.
5 key words right there.  Describes a consensual act.
Consent only counts if the mob tells you it does.
Actions speak louder than words and right now the Democratic front runner is acting like a teenage boy who hasn't masturbated in a week.
"Well, he WAS a democrat when he said it /tongue in cheek"
That’s one creepy old guy.
Creepy old joe’s love pecks.
Count on creepy Joe
Quid pro creepy Joe.
I’m surprised he didn’t go for the lips. Sloppy Joe would’ve liked some tongue action.
At first glance I thought this was satire.
I was looking for the Babylon Bee link!
He wants to show more diversity by creeping out women of color too.
"That's what I was thinking. Until lately he's never been creepy with any women of color. At least he's not discriminating anymore. But it's probably an act. He said Obama was the FIRST clean, articular black guy."
"Headline: creepy joe molests another woman, at least this one wasn't a pre teen."
"The first woman is totally creeped out. Her speech slows down as soon as he takes her hand, and as soon as the intense staring starts, she completely looses her train of thought. The guy weirds me out. I don't think he even realizes that he's doing it."
"OK, they killed Jeffery Epstein KNOWING they can get away it it, Joe Biden is going to molest away knowing he can get away with it too."
keep on creepin on.
Biden is the gift that keeps giving
Effing Creeper!
Please win the nomination Joe!
Went looking for a better source and found that this is from 2017. Not new news.
"<a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/joe-biden-kisses-college-grad-on-the-cheek"">https://www.teenvogue.com/story/joe-biden-kisses-college-grad-on-the-cheek</a>"
"Man, I wish this were satire."
LMFAO I cant believe hes still doing this
The DNC has probably already cut her a check for her outstanding college debt. He is going to be the nominee so don't expect this to get any traction outside of Fox. A few months ago liberal media would have roasted him for this behavior.
Biden won't be the nominee. His support has been decreasing since Day 1 for shit like this.
This was 3 years ago. Still creepy though
So who do you think will be?
"I think he had to, since his victims to date have not been diverse enough."
He's lucky corn pop wasn't around
Disgusting animal. He won’t even hide it anymore. Put him in office and it’ll be Bill Clinton all over again and worse
Creeper? Aw man
"Poor Ol' Joe. His kid's brought his candidacy to its knees, and now it looks like he's not stopped kissing and groping."
Poor poor Ol' Joe...
Ol' creepy Joe at it again with the rape vibes.
"First video: that woman is the most boring person I've ever heard talk. Though I feel like there's not much going on that's creepy or really inappropriate. Yes, he takes her phone and wants to take a selfie but then she kinda starts things off by brushing him off. "
"Second video: yup, just more Joe being Joe. Don't forget he's 78. He grew up when black people were still treated like 2nd class citizens. So, now he's gotta try to make it look like he likes them."
Wowowowow creepy grandpa Joe at it again. Truly unbelieveable how tone deaf he is. But then again he's a liberal so being tone deaf is just par for the course.
At least this one isn't 6
"What's creeper, Grandpa Joe kissing everyone or his son Hunter leaving his wife so he can bang his dead bros widow?"
Joe's campaign is about spreading love. Whether we like it or not.
Lol! They don't build frontrunners like they used to.
"Everytime we see this, we need to tweet this shit to the FBI"
"I seriously want to donate to Creepy Uncle Joe's campaign in hopes that he wins the nomination, my God..... it would be hilarious, like Kavanaugh but with <em>actual</em> victims complete with photographic and video evidence.  For <em>decades.</em>"
"Who wants this pervert/pedophile as president? Quid Pro Joe. ""Well son of a bitch, he got fired""-Joe Biden."
Creepy AF.
"Why, in that first video, is there a giant Mexican flag on the wall next to his campaign slogan. In Iowa??"
"She seemed more excited than shocked, but it still creeps me the F out."
Watching that was the most cringe moment I've had so far in 2020.
Creepy Joe at it again!
It’s going to be weird in the presidential debates when he comes up behind Trump and gives him a big kiss.
Lmao. That’d be a shocker
Biden strikes again
Is that Pope Biden?
Imagine what his family photo albums look like..
Me before checking the link: alright guys can we calm it down on the satire posts in here
Me after checking the link: why
He is definitely the kind of guy you see looking through your window at night
What a fucking creeper. He's done.
FUCKING YIIIIIIIIKE
The man is a creep
Grab em by the cheek
Eeeeewwwwww if someone I didn't know REALLLLY well did that. I'd slap him.
where are his hands?
"Kind of explains why the Dems are trying so hard to keep their candidates out of the media.  Focus on impeachment, Iran, anything to keep the lens away from these morons."
"How is this filth leading in the polls.<br/>
You know what, don’t tell me"
Now I know where hunter gets his lust from
Well he might be a pervert but you can't call him a racist anymore for not smelling black kids
"Creepy Joe, at it again"
"Press charges, this is assault."
Jesus christ this guy just can’t help himself! Spent too much time with Billy-Boy I’m betting..
Malarkey!!!!!!
Gropin' Joe will probably pass this off as another innocent instance of how warm and affectionate he is.
Wasn’t even a peck...looked like he planted his lips there and held for the hair sniff...creepy AF
The Left has to keep supporting Biden because their entire impeachment argument revolves around Biden running for President.
"It's perfectly ok, he's a Democrat."
"One would think, after being repeatedly called out on it, Biden would dramatically alter his behavior as he's currently running for President of the United States. Trump was lambasted for this ""grab her by the pussy"" comment, yet Biden is actively and currently sexually assaulting women and there's completely silence from the Left."
Why is this pedophile allowed to get away with this crap in public and documented? If anyone else did this they would be in jail or at least charged with something.
This looks like a credible source.
So he's basically like Trump minus the pussy grabbing...?
"In the fantasies of the Left, I guess."
"Are y’all mad that women accuse conservatives of rape, but not democrats? Like seriously? "
"If someone does something like this their political viewpoints really don’t matter. However, if you want to accuse democrats of this, you literally have to concede that Trump is fucked up. Sexual assault on either side is not mutually exclusive, it can happen on both sides."
"Accusations aren’t evidence, bud. If there was as much footage of Trump groping and sniffing women and children as this guy, everyone would be rightly outraged."
"How about being caught on audio saying he can do whatever he wants to women because he's a celebrity? Oh wait, that's just ""locker room talk"". Fuck out of here. "
They're both creepy in their own old man creepy way. Let the downvotes rain down. At least I can admit they're both fucking weird. But the zombies will smash the down arrow because I said something not nice about their king.
"Here’s the thing though, I agree. It’s a shitty thing to say, and I wouldn’t want to hang out with the guy who said it. I had a friend who used to talk to women in the same way - it was complete overcompensation and an attempt to impress his ‘bros’."
"But again, the difference is, that’s just words. Nobody, as far as I know, has actually seen him do that, especially not on video. There’s a monumental difference between saying something sad and creepy like Trump did, and doing something creepy like Biden did. Not only did, but did multiple times, on camera, to many different women and children, got called out on it, apologises, <em>and then still carries on doing it to this day.</em> "
"It’s like comparing a guy who said he once took part in a street race, to a guy who repeatedly gets caught driving drunk. They’re both stupid and dangerous, but one of them is literally observable and quantifiable."
"I've had friends in the past that were degrading towards women. However, they never talked about using a position of power to physically assault them. It's the same reason it's unacceptable for a boss to come on to a subordinate. It's unethical. "
"Support Trump for whatever reason you want. But don't give me that shit that he is somehow morally superior to Biden. Hell, he divorced his first wife because he didn't want to sleep with somebody that's had kids. His own fucking kids! Not to mention the confirmed cheating while the mother of his children is birthing and nursing his child. Somehow that isn't worse than Biden acting awkward and creepy on camera?"
"Again, you’re comparing someone who’s a shitty husband and partner to someone who gropes children in public. Trump is no moral character, that’s absolutely undeniable, but if you can’t recognise the difference between the two, you’re clearly not approaching this from a position that even closely resembles impartiality. ‘Awkward and creepy’ is not how you describe a person who shows that level of inappropriate physical affection for children. Try ‘disgusting and repulsive’."
"lol lol lol
""Gropes children"" 🤣🤣🤣
Are you fucking serious?"
"His behavior is a bit awkward and creepy. If you think he is seriously groping children on camera, you're fucking fried and are in need of a reality check. Don't preach to me about being impartial when you're parroting fabricated bullshit. Take a break from YouTube, my guy."
Take a break from looking at video footage of him literally feeling up children? Maybe you need to spend a couple of minutes checking it out.
"Ask any father what they’d like to do to an old man who touched their children like that, and they’ll tell you it’s well beyond “awkward”."
"I am a father and if the vice president of the United States simply put his hands on my kids shoulders, my fatherly instinct would be heightened but I wouldn't fly off the rails. If he, as you have said, groped my child, I'd be throwing hands. You may want to look up the definition of grope. There is absolutely no evidence, whatsoever, that he has ever groped anybody. It's a smear campaign and it seems as though you've got your feet taped to the bicycle on this one. With that said, I wish you luck, and I'm tapping out of this conversation."
"There’s a lot more accusations on Trump though. 
Plus there is this, <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.amp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.amp.html</a>."
"One man is guilty for his words, another not, despite his actions. Classic leftism."
The transcript says he had consent lol. Not sure why people still try to link it. You can say he's shity for cheating or for being vulgar but that's it.
Of course there is. The left accuses everyone else of everything without proof. They'll say anything to project their own actions onto others and victimize themselves.
I think it’s more a case of double standards. People just want everyone to call a ball a ball and a strike a strike.
Damn he is almost as funny as Trump. Out of the 3 lead candidates for democrat he’s by far the most entertaining.
correct
"It's funny because every time big news like this starts to unfold, I think to myself in what ridiculous way the left could act thatd be totally believable but still insane. I thought to myself during this ""you know, I feel like the left is going to go out on a limb in this one and actually defend the terrorist."" Sure enough, that's exactly what they are doing."
"Remind me when he shot down an American airliner with 290 people aboard and told the world in the aftermath that he would never apologize for Iran, I forget when that was"
"Found the terrorist sympathizing, misogynist, bootlicker. (I can play your name-calling games too). Be sure to tell the 1500 Iranian protestors killed just a couple weeks ago by Soleimani that you are mourning his death."
I went on Arabnews.com (to read their articles on what happened) and they basically said that they thought he was a bad guy and got what was coming to him. 
It took me no more than 5 minutes to do that ‘research’ so I don’t know why the left can’t do the same instead of immediately jumping on the media bandwagon of hate.
You're right Soleimani was a thug but I wouldn't trust a Saudi propaganda outlet's view on a country they've been in proxy conflict with for decades
"It's not that they <em>can't</em> do that... it's just hard to prove that ""orange man bad"" if you cite sources outside the echo chamber."
Arabnews.com
"You know iranians aren't arabs, right ? Arabnews.com is a Saudi newspaper, the kind of jihadists you love, and they do tend to hate iranians, big news."
It’s insane liberals are citing Iranian media interviews as proof of Soleimani being a fair and loving person. 
I can understand having reservation about assassinating people overseas. But using anything from a theocratic government-run press in a country with a notorious history of hostility as a “character witness” is ridiculous. 
Their lunacy knows no bounds.
"Iranians on reddit have said the same.  His image in Iran isn’t so much of a “Right Hand Man”, as it is an image of the defence of their home, and their people.  Mind you this is shared by both average people and those who are open critics of the Iranian government."
Trump should have announced that Soleimani is making plans against the US and that he won’t do anything to stop him. Then when the outrage starts up THAT’S when he should have bombed him lol
"The source seems to present non-factual information for e.g <a href=""https://coffeeordie.com/area-51/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coffeeordie.com/area-51/</a> (‘MAGA Marauders’ Dig In to Defend Area 51 From the Horde) "

"Do you know the problem with this? We have politicians who are responsible for the deaths of many. For e.g. some politicians in the USA and if someone does a targetted strike at that politician, a section will be genuinely happy that the politician is gone. You will be for sure! "
​
"This was the case with World War I, and World War II.  We are better than this and intelligent people will have to prevent the next war. It is one thing to take done OSAMA bin laden - hunted terrorist vs another to take down Mohammed Bin Salem who is responsible for death of American Journalists."
Are you tired of winning yet?
<strong>Article:</strong>
"The U.S. population grew last year at the slowest rate since World War I as the birth rate and immigration declined, the Census Bureau reported last week. Slowing population growth will have significant economic and social implications for the country, but especially for high-tax states."
"The Census Bureau and IRS last week also released state population growth and income migration data for 2018 that show the exodus from high-tax to low-tax states is accelerating. Four states have lost population since 2010 including West Virginia (-3.3%), Illinois (-1.2%), Vermont (-0.3%) and Connecticut (-0.2%), but 10 experienced declines last year. New York was the biggest loser as a net 180,000 people left for better climes. Over the last decade New York has lost more of its population to other states (7.2%) than any other save Alaska (8%), followed by Illinois (6.8%), Connecticut (5.6%) and New Jersey (5.5%)."
"Hmmm, what do these states have in common? Large tax burdens and politically powerful public unions. Illinois’s property tax rates are the second highest in the country after New Jersey. The state lost $5.6 billion in adjusted gross income last year to other states, about twice as much as in 2012. Notably, income outflow hasn’t increased from Michigan or Wisconsin."
"Illinois’s 4.95% flat income tax is lower than many of its neighbors, but Democrats are pushing a state constitutional amendment on the November ballot for a progressive income tax. Voters should look how that’s turned out for other high-tax states."
"New York’s 12.7% top marginal rate is the second highest in the U.S. In the last two years New York has lost a net $18 billion in adjusted gross income. The wealth exodus is reducing revenue and making it harder to fund programs like Medicaid. As Gov. Andrew Cuomo groused last year, “Tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich. We did that. God forbid the rich leave.”"
"Connecticut was a tax haven in the Northeast before it adopted an income tax in 1991, and Democrats have raised the rate again and again. The 6.99% top rate, which hits individuals making more than $500,000, is now higher than Massachusetts’s 5.1% flat tax and not much of a bargain on New Jersey’s 8.97% “millionaire tax.”"
"That was New Jersey’s top rate on income of more than $500,000 before Democrats in 2018 imposed a 10.75% surtax on folks making more than $5 million. But the state is still short on revenue to pay government pensions, so Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy wants to extend the 10.75% top rate to income above $1 million."
"Then there’s California, where the 13.3% top rate on individuals making more than $1 million is the nation’s highest. Democrats in the Golden State have long proclaimed that raising taxes on the rich won’t make them leave and they flog old data showing that more high earners moved into the state than left."
"No more. The exodus of high earners has accelerated since voters approved a referendum in 2012 raising the top rate on income above $250,000. The ratio of tax returns over $200,000 moving into and out of the state was then about equal. Now the ratio is about three to two and is higher than for middle and lower earners."
"Last year California lost $8 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, up from about $135 million in 2012. Much of this is higher capital-gains income earned by the affluent. High housing costs, diminished economic opportunities and lousy public schools in California and other liberal states have also sent young workers and middle-class families packing."
"Since 2010, California, New York and Illinois have experienced the largest population declines among people under age 18, though New Jersey and Connecticut also rank high. Fewer young workers will make it harder to keep state economies growing to pay for government entitlements and pensions."
"Where are high-tax state exiles going? Zero income tax Florida drew $16.5 billion in adjusted gross income last year. Many have also fled to Arizona ($3.5 billion), Texas ($3.5 billion), North Carolina ($3 billion), Nevada ($2.3 billion), Colorado ($2.1 billion), Washington ($1.7 billion) and Idaho ($1.1 billion). Texas, Nevada and Washington don’t have income taxes."
"Democrats in high-tax states blame the 2017 tax reform, which limited the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000 and thus increased the effective federal tax rate for the well-to-do. The cap took effect in 2018, but most taxpayers would not have felt the pain until they paid their taxes last year. Taxpayer flight may accelerate even more now."
"All of this explains why Democrats are nervous about the 2020 Census, which will decide apportionment of House seats and electoral votes for the next decade. California, Illinois and New York are each projected to lose a seat while Texas is forecast to pick up three, Florida two and Arizona one."
"We know progressives believe in redistribution, and it’s kind of Democrats to spread their wealth and political power to other states."
Thank you again - Can I just give you like 200 up votes for the next 200 articles?
"And of course here in California the Leftists love to go on and on about our “5th largest economy” and how we send out more money to the feds than we take in and that we “prop up red states”.  All the while ignoring that we have 1/3 of the nations welfare recipients, the largest homeless population by far, schools that are some of the worst in the nation, crumbling infrastructure, huge public employee pension debts and a massive out-migration of residents who are fed up with the high cost of living that gives them nothing in return all thanks to their hard-Left, progressive policies."
Mueller had several of the same FBI agents working in his investiagtion that worked on the original botched FBI investigation. Even the lawyer who faked the CIA email and who will likely go to prison (he was kicked off the Mueller team when texts were leaked showing how extremely anti-Trump he was).
This is supposed to be satire ... so why is so close to reality ?
Yeah this is actual fact. Satire and fact are so intertwined these days thanks to MSM. Mad world
"Probably not the correct place to type this, but earlier today I got in a political debate with some girl and she said what Trump did was an unjustified act of war, Solemni did nothing wrong, and that Iran was always following the Nuclear Treaty."
"I told her ""Well there were trade sanction's set on North Korea and the US told China to stop fueling North Korea nuclear program. Do you think China stopped? No. So with all Iran has done in the Middle East do you think they abided by the treaty?"""
"I also explained how ww3 couldn't erupt from this because Russia and China don't seem to care about the situation and NATO wouldn't help because it's not a defensive war on the US side. She proceeded to call me an Incel and a ""Retarded Conservative""."
Weird how  SJWs are utterly obsessed with other people's sex lives.
So are you saying someone being trans is not your business?
"It becomes my business when they manipulate little kids minds and dress them up (always as if they were older with make-up and skimpy clothes, but no pedophilia there, no sir), when they demand I pay for their surgery, or demand that I use their ""pronouns"" to play into their mental illness."
For real why df should I have to pay my tax money to some creepy mentally ill rapist who wants a pair of boobs and a vagina?
How are they going to rape people without a dick?
"Also, you don't have to do anything, transitioning isn't covered by programs like ahccs and medicare."
"Also also, children can't receive hormone treatment, both legally and medically."
"Also also also, you just have to not harass people for being trans in some blue states. It's like how if you call a black person the N-word once you're mean but not a criminal. You'd have to persistently follow them and harass them."
"Also also also also, psychologists have classified being trans as a mental illness, but the treatment is transitioning."
"Also also also also also, children can socially transition and potentially take puberty blockers once they reach 16 if they get approval from a psychiatrist. (Socially transition=wear matching clothes and go by matching pronouns)"
How are they going to rape people without a dick?
"You're aware that many ""trans"" people never have bottom surgery, and don't want or intend to, right?"
"Also also, children can't receive hormone treatment, both legally and medically."
"<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-transgender-kids-transition-medical-risks-are-both-known-and-unknown/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wrong.</a>  Very <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sex-change-treatment-for-kids-on-the-rise/"" rel=""nofollow"">wrong</a>."
"Also also also also, psychologists have classified being trans as a mental illness, but the treatment is transitioning."
"Yeah, funny how they've decided that the only possible treatment for this mental illness is surgery to validate it.  Its almost like activists decided what the treatment should be instead of doctors with the best interest of the patients in mind."
It says in the article that you cited that children are allowed puberty blocking drugs which have reversible effects and give the child time to mature without the distress of physical changes that are dissonant with their self image.
"Hormone replacement can start at 16, with psychiatric approval. And gender reassignment surgery can't happen until they're 18."
"As for the raping without a dick thing, that was a joke, you yourself said that your money shouldn't go to ""giving vaginas to rapists"" which means you have to believe they are both cutting their dicks off and raping people at the same time."
children are allowed puberty blocking drugs which have reversible effects
Turns out that blocking puberty in children has permanent effects.  Who could have guessed.
"Hormone replacement can start at 16, with psychiatric approval."
"Last I checked, 16 year olds are still children."
"16 year olds are usually fucking eachother and smoking weed so letting them have enough bodily autonomy to take hormones with, and I can't stress this enough, psychiatric approval, is common sense."
"Also, you can say that they have permanent effects, but that doesn't make it true just because you feel like it's true."
That means you won the argument.
Noice!
Finally some hard hitting journalism.
This is not satire.
"Haha, I have posted almost the same thing a few times already on reddit."
[deleted]
Great headline!!!
"Serious question, do we have serious evidence that they have not been abiding by the deal? I doubt they were as well but can we actually prove it?"
Maybe they are mourning his death because it symbolically represents the DNC death with each Trump accomplishment?   Maybe.  .  LoL 
They are just trying to make anything the President does into a negative
I dunno I just caught ABC Nightly News and they seemed to be mourning pretty hard too.
No one mourning his death outside of the middle east.
Have you seen Rose McGowans Twitter?
She is smoking
This is pretty dumb. Nobody actually liked this guy. We just don't want another war.
"Yes, the lady who continuously encouraged war at the UN, and then signed up to be a shill for Boeing after leaving her job, has definitely some wisdom we should consider."
"It's an irresistible message part of the victim-hood narrative the Left is pushing: ""It's not your fault"". Forget personal responsibility; put our politicians in power and you can count on them to rescue you."
"Translation, Mitch knows that the RINO Three<sup>TM</sup> are in line. "
I don't know... I'm beginning to wish the drags on a bit longer.  
"On an unrelated question, when is the first primary for the Dems?"
The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd.
Yep.  That would be a good time for the deadline to dismiss or hold the trial in abstentia where the House is concerned.
Dem Senators are already blinking and pushing back at Nancy.
Are you tired of winning yet?
All this winning is getting <em>boring</em>... <strong>Naaaaah</strong> just kidding!
This is kinda boring though.
"More tiring than boring, probably."
"It feels like a poorly paced movie that you think is an action movie when you buy the tickets, but turns out to be a drama. Kinda like Alexander. This impeachment thing is the Alexander of politics."
Zzzzzzzz.
Kind of like Ad Astra
"OMG. All they had to do was work with him for 4 years and claim credit for things getting done, blame him for the bad stuff and put up a non crazy viable candidate and he prolly would of been out in 2020. But no they went the bat crap crazy direction  and really weakened their position across the country. "
Now they will probably have to 4 more years tacked on. And they will will continue to push against him.
This isn't win.  The Dems will scream bloody murder about the GOP voting not to allow their witnesses and they will not call Joe and Hunter Biden because the GOP Senate is all involved in the same sort of corruption.
The Dems can trot out any kind of narrative they wish. It's still not moving the numbers in their favor.
"Wow.  Steyn nails it normally, but my God this might be his best work ever."
Agreed. I’m a huge fan of Steyn and this is one of his best.
"And in just the last few months we see the WAPO calling Solomani a ""most revered military leader"" , the NYT referring to Abu Bakr <em>al</em>-<em>Baghdadi</em> as an ""austere religious scholar"" possessing a  “a spiritual gift"". Easy to see what happens to free speech when the press rolls over."
No casualties or property damage?...Where are they aiming?
So this is basically how it all went down: 
Solemani approves attacks on US embassy on New Year’s Eve
US kills Solemani
Iran vows for revenge
"Iran attacks US military base, only kills Iraqi civilians"
Iran basically surrenders because they know they’re in over their head
"Very nicely done, Iran 👍🏼👍🏼"
When did they surender?
They didn’t officially surrender but they said they would stop attacking if we agreed to stop. Which is a de facto way of saying they give up.
Probably SCUDs. Let's all quake in fear.
The pentagon hasn’t confirmed or denied any damage or casualties yet. I don’t think we’ll being get numbers for a day or so.
"Meanwhile, the Iranian missile crews are putting on their chin straps and lining up their first aid kits...."
I gotta believe we're going to respond harshly as we should
"Issue may be it has to go through Congress, the do nothing dems who love Iran May vote to do nothing. Hopefully this will wake America up and get some of these terrorist loving S.O.Bs out of their respective positions."
"True.  On one hand, they have the audacity to claim Trump is weak. The next, they'd gladly sit by and not respond to an attack on our people.  Disgusting"
"Though I must ask. Since Iran has attacked our troops, why should POTUS/Pentagon need permission from Congress to respond?  Not declaring war, just a leathal response letting Iran know we aren't going to allow this"
I’m not familiar with all the laws but wouldn’t a direct attack on Iran essentially be war? I would prefer the checks and balances our founding fathers implemented stay in tact. Never a fan of giving gov. (Or a single person) more power.
"Under a strict reading of the Constitution, arguably, but in practice it hasn’t worked that way in a long time. For relatively short engagements the President can basically do whatever the fuck he wants (at least presidents have done exactly that in the past)."
Perhaps some enterprising DD skipper will find some Iran patrol boats to frag
[removed]
"Well, if the USA is going to war, it would be nice if they remove the absolutely horrible Islamic state and modernize"
Yeah that has worked well in the past
Was Trump bluffing or will we start destroying them?
This isn’t necessarily anything new. Iraq-US coalition bases are pretty often subjected to rocket attacks by Iran backed militas.
Chances are Iran just blew up some dirt with these missiles.
[deleted]
"Iran attacking Iraqi-US coalition bases through proxy militias (like Hezbollah, who attacked the embassy)."
Iran directly attacking Iraqi-US coalition bases after their general whos job it was to oversee said proxy militas is killed.
Directly or indirectly it is still Iran. Weve been at war with Iran since the coup in the 50’s.

"What's he supposed to say? He probably has to meet with people about this, which is higher priority.  When there's a decision or something to say, he'll address the nation."
"Odd, past presidents would have addressed the nation when attacked. But I guess thats fine..."
[removed]
First time seeing it :( why you so angry bud
I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good
I noticed one of these... :( 
So here take this... :D
Aww lol thanks gents
Sorry. I just saw it. Real human. Robots would have checked better. :p
"""At this point what difference does it make?"" - HRC"
Anything from a celebrity doctor should be taken with a massive grain of salt...particularly Baden.
The Dr was hired by the Epstein family. Grains of salt needed.
"With the whole ""security footage unusable"" and the guards just so happening to not be watching him when he died, I don't think that many grains are needed."
I agree. It's lines up with what i  believe but its not coming from the sources that matter.
I hope that he and the other kids walk away with so much money that it cripples these companies. Those celebrities and other tv personalities that called for their doxing and punishment should be sued as well
"Nah, it's a billion dollar company that has backing of many democrats. There is a reason why CNN is called Clinton News Network. They basically run with one narration. This is why this happened in the first place. Narration looked better to them than truth. And truth was out there. It was not the case where someone lied to them since whole video with how this started was on YouTube."
It's a billion dollar company. Even if they would pay up whole sum they would still be fine.
HAHAHA CNN lost!!
Here’s hoping he can reap a whirlwind from the admins here at reddit that allowed him to be smeared unjustly.
"If it happens enough, they might be more careful about that trash they publish."
"For some reason, CNN didn't want to go to trial. The e-mails and tweets that would have turned up probably would have destroyed the last particles of credibility they have. They are breathing a sigh of relief as they write out the check."
I hope those dirty hippies Black Hebrew Israelites are seeing this and going insane with defeat and jealousy.
What did he do to cause “emotional damages”
Let's plaster your face across all media and the Internet falsely calling you a filthy racist bigot for a couple weeks and see how your emotions are affected.
Defamation of character. Slander. Libel. 
Referring to someone as a sociopathic racist is a serious charge.
Words have consequences. Those who speak Snowflake don’t grasp this...but that doesn’t change anything in the eyes of the law.
He or they?
Took me a minute. You got me good.

Doesn't she have a concealed carry permit?
"As wealthy as she is, she can afford to pay people to carry them for her."
Yes it’s in the video
Let me try it this way.
"I used to work corrections.  We had close to absolute authority for searches and patdowns, I could on a whim, call a couple coworkers and turn my pod upside down, search every cell to my heart's content.  Everyone entering the facility was searched and wanded.  Every inmate was strip searched on entry."
We still had weapons and drugs make it into the facility.
Now imagine trying to get rid of them in the common parts of the country.
People are immensely resourceful when there is no other option.
Amazing. That is his biggest cause.
Judge Judy is a conservative. So her stance isn't really shocking.
She's an independent and a plurality of her views are liberal.
"Uh, wasn’t it her that just endorsed Bloomie?"
"Could be wrong, but I thought I saw something to that effect."
"I was with her up until the point where she said that people should not be allowed to own guns ""that can fire 100 rounds in 60 seconds.""  How many times have 100 round magazines been used for mass shootings in the country?  I can think of one (Las Vegas)."
"She also was really walking a fine line when she said that people who ""should"" own guns should be able to have them.  Does this mean people who haven't been convicted of crimes, or is it only held for those who are ex-military or law enforcement?  I liked a lot of what she said, but there was some very dangerous language that she used as well."
"How many 100 round drums are reliable enough to do that, even?  "
"These people don’t seem to understand the factors that determine standard magazine sizes on firearms.  It’s always been the maximum number of rounds that can be reliable fed without compromising human factors (e.g. usability, weight, handling, etc.).  That’s always been true whether it’s civilian or military use."
"Is this any surpise a judge or now tv judge/lawyer  in real life feels that protecting myself with proper training and using a gun properly is no big deal. I mean like Judy says bad guys will find ways to get them through stealing, black markets, etc. I mean there not walking through the door and buying guns legally after they go to jail, unless they are doing something illegal like Id fraud. You cant rely on cops to be good or help you with every problem."
who the fuck cares what Judge Judy has to say?
She’s the only person who can Judge me
"Well, her and Jesus."
"The New York Times trying so hard to prop this terrorist up into making him look like an honest human being and senior official is not only pathetic, but absolutely disgusting. We get they you guys hate trump, but that doesn’t excuse you from lying to the American public."
"While I do agreed that it is the failing New York Times, I mainly think the reason for the first part is because Soleimani already has an infamous reputation while lots of people might not know the coach. That stated, the New York Times is only still there because they are so integrated into the education system."
"It's really sad to me to see my friends in relationships where they aren't friends with the people they are dating, but see them as &lt;gender role, which is the enemy of my gender&gt; and &lt;relationship role, which is not a person&gt; and relate to them like that. I think this kind of indoctrination (anti men or anti women) leads to that"
The breakdown of reality is what’s causing this and almost all of society’s problems.  In this instance it’s the displacement of gender roles because of the total nonsense of “there’s more than two genders” ideology.  The traditional American family can’t exist in a world where “men” can give birth for example.
Every girl acts like a dude  ...
"Yep. That's why several of those ""tough"" female rappers are very popular. Women (feminists) want to be more aggressive and masculine, and feminists want men to become less ""toxic"" (aka become more meek, mild, and feminine). Normal men aren't going to like that and will respond with an opposing movement. It's depressing because it reminds me of that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink"" rel=""nofollow"">mouse utopia experiment</a>. We have lots of resources, but our culture is rapidly changing and that has big implications; it's like our society is dying a spiritual death."
Young men not getting laid is driving the growth.  No one hates women while they're getting regular sex.
Think you’re getting downvoted by women.
Not sure why they'd care.  It's typically sexless white knights who get offended.
They are both exact opposites and both driven by social media echo chambers. Most people in real life aren’t like that.
When all you do is target straight white men.  Of course they will turn away
Just a quick addition:
The initial MGTOW was nothing more than <strong>opting out</strong> of the societal expectations that men supposed to meet and not trying to adhere to the traditional expectations anymore. Simply going your own way. You could've considered it a modern day hermit lifestyle where men trying to find another purpose in life besides becoming provider and a cornerstone of a family.
What MGTOW became however is indeed increasingly hostile toward women and so contributing toward the breakdown between genders.
"I'd venture to guess that MGTOW changed because some people misinterpreted the general idea. Admittedly when a man goes MGTOW that more often than not is the result of burning out and/or involves significant losses/issues in one's life caused by a woman, or by radical feminism."
"That often results with a bitterness and so some MGTOW men voice that carelessly, giving the wrong impression to other men who think that is how MGTOW men supposed to be and relate to women, which of course attracts men who have a hatred for women, so now the MGTOW term is associated with that hate."
Present day MGTOW ran the same course as present day Feminism did. Initially it was not about hate.
"&gt; “Men are disgusted by women in almost  every way today.” These were the words of a distressing, yet eye-opening  conversation I recently had with a long time male buddy of mine."
"Firstly, this is incorrect. I truly doubt men are disgusted but are getting more disgusted in the environment."
"Feminism pretty much is it's own worst enemy by trying to push hatred into everything while touting it's public ""equality"" stance."
"Its not so much feminism as it is the radical type.  The kind that says that women are better than men in all ways, that men need to feminize themselves to become better.  I'm sorry, but fuck off Nancy.  I'm gonna drink my beer, shoot my deer, open the door for my wife and tell dirty off color jokes when I'm hanging out with the guys."
Feminism = equal rights/pay for men and women
"Radical Feminism = How I think most people picture feminism
- Women wanting men to be equal OR inferior to women 
- Want to eliminate the patriarchy 
- deemed by some as “feminazi’s”
- stereotyped as buzzed head, bra burning, butch lesbians in pink pussy hats
- ironically a good portion have the same feeling towards transgendered people as the majority in this subreddit <a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2/amp"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>"
Edit: a word/spelling
Feminism = equal rights/pay for men and women
"Uh, no.  Feminism is a movement to confer upon women all the authority of men while retaining all the advantages of womanhood and rejecting the responsibilities of both."
"It is not, nor has it ever been about equality.   The suffragettes of the 19teens handed out white feathers to men and boys not fighting in the Great War to shame them into dying for their  country.  The proud strong women of the 1940s in the US did much the same and still insisted on being women at home even during the labor shortage of the war.  Rosie the Riveter was a propaganda piece put out by the war department.  Geraldine Doyle <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-complex-legacy-of-rosie-the-riveter/69268/"">(Rosie's likeness)</a> worked as a machine operator for a whole 2 weeks before quitting out of fear of injury."
"Feminists fought for the vote for women but never the draft.  They pay lip service to ending selective service for men but spend their time obsessing over new ways to shame men for daring to have an opinion or to speak in their presence (mansplaining).   They demand abortion, the right to abandon a child, the right to men's money but fight tooth and nail against laws that would ensure more equal treatment in divorce proceedings (see the Florida law for equal parental custody from 2015 and every attempt to pass a law limiting alimony.)"
"They demand special consideration for college entrance, special scholarships, special consideration for employment and special consideration for advancement.   This, despite being nearly 60% of all college students, scholarships specific to their gender (good luck finding scholarships exclusively for men), and most larger companies having diversity policies that favor women (even in female dominated fields) for both hiring and advancement. "
"Your non-radical feminist will defend every one of the advantages listed above and demand more.  Feminism is not about equality.   It is about giving advantage to women, and giving as much advantage as possible."
"I’m sorry, but you need to go read a dictionary. You’re lumping in feminists and radical feminists all together. "
Just imagine this... women (and men) can have a variety of different thoughts and ideas. Many align with each other and are sorted into categories that best describe their beliefs. But there are many crossovers as well. 
It sounds like you have a huge chip on your shoulder and you’re taking your jilted view of feminism and projecting it.
Missiles targeting US bases in areas not populate by Americans? Sounds like Iran saying “we got the message” but we’re gonna put on a show.
"Do you think their missiles are that accurate? This isnt call of duty, they most likely just missed."
"Tough to tell.  Seems based on Iran's own reports from their attacks in Syria a few years back that they are capable of very accurate strikes.  But that self reporting has been challenged, so tough to tell"
They also touted their new fighter jet as high tech and advanced and better than the f18 and refused to give tech specs.  Turns out its a ripoff of a vietnam era plane.
"Which is still better than their ""stealth"" plane they unveiled which turned out to be a wooden model so small that a person couldn't even fit into it."
"Yeah that's my sense.  Iran doesn't have pinpoint accuracy, their missile crews are not experienced, and their intelligence isn't going to be as up to date as you would need to ensure no Americans got killed.  Hell 1/3 of their missiles failed to launch/failed after launch, and they (probably) accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner."
Yep.  That's the scenario im assuming based on available info until i have a reason to believe otherwise
"My first thought to Iran's missile launches was: really? Against America?  Then I read this and thought: of course, like Iran was actually going to mess with with America."
Counting coup. Thats all.
coo? like a pigeon?
Spell checked. Thanks.
"Good. He probably should have done this awhile ago. Once your wife turns on you, you kinda know it's over."
I don't think his wife turned on him. I think that was a strategic maneuver to minimize her punishment. But I agree with you. I'm happy he's gone.
"That's what is was. She took a deal. I just hated when the whole Katie Hill thing was going on people kept saying ""but what about Duncan Hunter"". Like ya, they're both pieces of shit. Except no one ever praised Duncan Hunter or called him brave."
"Way to be, Duncan..."
Good riddance
Now they have to pass it.
"Count on Senators Murkowski, Collins, and Romney to vote no, at the very least."
"Good, let's get those cowards on record."
It isn't like they care.  I didn't pull those names out of thin air.  They have a history.
"Manchin, Sinema, and Jones might vote ""yes"" to save their political skins."
Who implied anything of the sort? All I said was get them on record.
"Collins is up for re-election this year. I don't know how she votes, but whichever way she votes, it will hurt her."
"Her best bet is to vote against changing the Senate rules, then vote for aquittal/dismissal. Support for removal is much lower than support for holding a trial."
"I dunno about that.  Even though they hate Trump and probably want more of a show trial, they probably do want to move things along."
That photo of Pelosi. When Botox goes bad.
Good. Give a hard deadline so that she can’t dawdle any more.
This is what she wants. She will go on TV saying republicans don't want justice... Blah blah blah.
Pelosi:  Thank you!
She's waiting for more Republican Senators to say they will vote Trump innocent no matter the evidence during the Senate trial. McConnel has pretty much already done this and so has another Republican Senator. 
"When they say this in public they can be labeled unreliable, or biased jurors by the Dems who can petition Chief Justice Roberts to kick them out, narrowing the Republican-Democrat difference to one where only a small minority of Republicans have to flip in order to remove Trump from office."
Not how it works.
"<a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/476567-senators-keep-your-oaths-so-help-you-god"" rel=""nofollow"">Yes it could be</a> Senators must take an Oath of Impartiality during the Impeachment Trial. Violation of this Oath can result in the Democrats going after Justice Roberts to make these Republicans recuse themselves from the trial."
"Not really. There's no way to prove a violation of the oath unless later it becomes apparent that someone was bribed, etc.  Roberts can't force anybody to recuse themselves."
All the Democrats have to be kicked out too then. Right?
Right???
"House Representatives were not placed under Oath of Impartiality because what they conducted was an ""investigation"". The Senate will take an Oath of Impartiality because they will be the jurors in a trial. If the Republicans can get quotes from Democratic Senators saying that they have already made up their minds on the trial they could pursue that course of action. "
Such quotes would include and look like:
"""That includes Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)."
"""I think the evidence is clear,"" said Warren, indicating she had already seen enough - even before any evidence is presented in the Senate trial - to convict Trump."
"""Everything I do during this, I'm coordinating with White House counsel,"" said McConnell. ""We all know how it's going to end. There is no chance the president is going to be removed from office.""
 He also said, ""I'm not impartial about this at all."" "
"Graham said, ""I have made up my mind ... I'm not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here."""""
"<a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/opinion/white-house/476567-senators-keep-your-oaths-so-help-you-god%3famp"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>"
All three of these senators could be asked to recuse themselves due to these statements.
That’s cute. Now include every Democrat who has ever made an anti-trump statement.
"Fairly certain it has to reference the trial, and I did. Warren's quote could get her asked to recuse herself. "
"Its not a test if they like the impeached party or not, its whether or not they will be impartial to the evidence presented at trial."
"Every Dem has made multiple statements indicating they’re not impartial. 
No they don’t have to specifically mention the trial. "
Either they all vote or no one does.
"There is no reason to do that. This process is political, not criminal. Nobody expects impartiality."
"Its still a trial. And they will be put under an Oath of Impartiality once the trial is set, even though noone expects them to be impartial. Even in civil cases of law, jurors are meant to be impartial so as to get a just ruling based on evidence."
It's still a political process.  There will be no repercussions for anybody voting party line.
"I understand that, and so does everyone but Justice Roberts is there to ensure Constitutionality of the proceedings, and I don't give the Dems the benefit of the doubt to turn him into a weapon."
Lol what's wrong with you?
Don't hold your breath on that one actually happening.
"I don't think it'll work, I just think its her strategy. They hate Trump so much that they will try any possible method to win"
"Even if some senators are removed, that doesn't change the circumstances. The percentage of votes needed to remove is determined by how many seats there are in the Senate, not how many Senators are currently in the chamber. It takes 67 votes to remove as long as there are still 100 senators. The democrats need more than a small number of flip votes. The chances of that are not likely at all."
"I love how they are ignoring everything Iran has done before this, praising how smart Obama was for not doing anything, giving excuse after excuse for Iran's actions against us, calling the attack on our embassy Trump's Benghazi, realizing it didn't amount to anything because Trump actually cares about our citizens overseas, saying he's Tweeting out war crimes even though he's warning Iran what will happen if they retaliate, I guess they don't know what brinkmanship is, and saying how Trump is doing the exact same thing that Clinton did when he was impeached. "
Trump is doing the same thing but somehow Trump is wrong in this instance. 
It's gotta be so tiring being a Lefty.
Edit: grammar
The key talking point right now is trying to distance Iran from the embassy attack. Go in any default sub on the topic and you will see tons of people trying to claim the embassy attackers werent Iranian supporters. 
Too bad for them there are literally photos of the attackers flying the Kata'ib Hezbollah flag
Whoops
I think they are two different strategies. Trump has a strong arm strategy and Obama had an appeasement strategy. 
Appeasement doesn’t work it was a poor decision but I don’t think Obama didn’t care about citizens abroad. He just thought appeasement would be more beneficial than a strong arm.
"Appeasement never works, we tried it at the start of WW2 and did it end any aggressions, no. It just gave Hitler an upper hand."
"Likewise, Iran's used the cash Obama gave them to build their own little empire and fight a bunch of wars."
"The first time you should learn appeasement doesn’t work is in the schoolyard. You punch a bully in the nose every time, from grade school to Hitler."
"Life is not this black and white. Appeasement can be your only option if you lack the power to back up strong arm policies. Likewise, punching the bully may be appropriate in some situations but not others. For example, if you're just a kid, likely the worst punishment you could face is suspension. But as an adult, if you punch a bully in the workplace, you will be fired or even wind up in jail. And going back to the schoolyard, the old adage that a bully is really a coward and will back down if punch him isn't necessarily the case either. Having worked in public schools, I know that some bullies pick on smaller kids, egging them on hoping they will attack them, so they can have an ""excuse"" to beat them up, and also to get the kid into trouble. Unfortunately most schools have zero tolerance policies for violence, so you can face suspension regardless of the reason for the violence (I've even seen kids suspended for self-defense). Not to say there aren't other, less direct methods of standing up for yourself, though."
The difference is we have the biggest stick.
Absolutely
"No we don’t.  Iran has Russia and China.  They fire nukes, and everything is over for everyone"
"Yep. It wasn’t a good idea then and isn’t now. Back then it honestly made more sense (not saying it was good). Germany was threat to UK sovereignty, Iran is no threat to US or European sovereignty. "
Why bend our backs to make them happy? Iran has no chance against the NATO or the US. 
I only worry that the Iranian leaders are too fundamental/radical and will start a war they can’t win.  Many western soldiers and civilians will die it would be a real shame.
I think that is why some on the other side have a problem with killing the Iran General.
It's not so much as starting the war with them (AOC's of the world would say otherwise) it's them starting a war with us.
"Appeasement did give the US time to build up industrial base. But, it is a strategy better suited to a short term goal than a long range policy."
"Who's this 'we?"""
I assume he is referring to chamberlain. I know that isn’t technically “we” but I get where he is coming from.
"So do I, but for all his domestic faults, can't really find much to complain about FDR's war efforts."
Yeah FDR tried pretty hard to enter the war for the allies. The US didn’t have the same seat at the table that it does now.  Either way he has the same point it is really just semantics. He means it didn’t work for our side.
Appeasement doesn’t work it was a poor decision but I don’t think Obama didn’t care about citizens abroad. He just thought appeasement would be more beneficial than a strong arm.
"I wouldn't know why anyone would be this idiotic. Not only was appeasement kind of the status quo, it also just never works. Neville Chamberlain has proven that in 1938, Theodore Roosevelt proved it in 1914, The league of nations has proven it in 1933, ... We can keep going, but is there even a single example where appeasement in the face of hostility has worked?"
"Frankly, this is a naive opinion that ignores the cost of war. "
The example that you asked for: China.
"China is not a good example. First of all, no open hostility yet. Second of all, the outcome is as of yet unclear."
"And yes, war has a cost. But as far as I'm aware, historians tend to agree that WW1 would have lasted at least one year less had the US been involved from the start, the german army was not ready for war in 1938, and forcing Japan to fight for it's gains in 1933 might have prevented the entire pacific campaign. Usually, a hard line against a bully is less costly in the long run."
Accurate.
I think the internet shill are just trying to avoid another trillion dollar war.
So why didn't they complain when Obama dropped 10s of thousands of bombs and launched military action in 7 different countries?
I did.
"This strawman is all over the place and nobody seems to see the irony.  Obama got a ton of shit from the left for fighting undeclared wars in the middle east, using the CIA to bypass congress's authority.  It's one of the big reasons the progressive left was so opposed to Hillary back in 2016.  "
"Sure, the liberal media didn't criticize him for it - we all know who they really work for.  But to act like the left was simply OK with extrajudicial killings under Obama and only opposes them now because ""orange man bad"" is ignorant.  "
"Besides, it works both ways.  You can't criticize Obama for bombing 7 countries and then praise this.  Unless, of course, you're only interested in playing team sports and don't care about silly things like the Constitution, the lives of American soldiers that are being gambled with, or the trillions of dollars a conflict with Iran might cost."
"Untrue, I can. Because the same people who wanted us to arm and support ISIS, and the same people who wanted us to attack Syria just when ISIS were weak, and the same people who wanted us to attack and destabalize Iraq ARE exactly the same people who don't want us to attack Iran."
Why? What do all these actions have in common?
"Iran getting nuclear weapons will ensure millions of Arabs will die and will ensure the US is embroiled in endless war in the Middle East, just like arming ISIS was going to ensure hundreds of thousands  of innocent people would die and that we would be embroiled in the Middle East for decades."
Fortunately trump put an end to all these things. He destroyed ISIS in a few months and is putting a quick end to Iran's nuclear problem.
Amazing.  You really are an old banana jeff.  
How's that wall going?
"Haha, I'll assume from your inability to say anything valuable that you are admitting I am right."
"Also, I know all you watch is propaganda so you have no actual idea what is going on,  but you do realize Democrats caved and agreed to fund the wall right? You aren't that ignorant of what is going on right?"
Keep on owning the libs.  Lol
Probably shouldn't elect any more democrats then. Every world war we've had has happened under a democratic president. Not to mention every democrat since Andrew Johnson has started some sort of foreign conflict while in office.
"Both democrats and republicans are war mongers. Republicans are way more bloodthirsty, and democrats just go along because both parties have the same donors. Iraq wasn't that long ago, but its okay if your memory isn't what it used to be."
"Not really, like I said every democratic in the past 150 years has started a war. Not to mention world war 1 and 2 started under dems, in addition to them nuking japan, starting a war with Vietnam, Libya,etc."
"The Dems/ The American left are not, nor have they ever been an anti war party. Rather they just feign hatred of war when the GOP is in power in order to appease their base of vegan hippie meatheads, and marxists neckbeards on social media."

"It's cute you think that we can just ""not start a war"" and the bad guys will respect that.  "
"""Hey boys, the US doesn't want to fight, so let's make sure to leave them alone""."
Pearl Harbor just called.
Problems existed in the middle east before the US and if the US ceases to exist in the future the middle east will still have problems.
Why?  You’re just going to waste the money on overpriced and failing health care and college scams instead. 
"But, in all seriousness: we aren’t going to war unless Iran conducts a mass casualty terrorist attack on us."
"It won't come to that. While it will be costly to the US, Iran will in all likelyhood lose way more. At some point they are going to back down."
How many trillions will we go into debt before they back down? Just wondering.
"That entirely depends on which actions are taken and by how much the conflict is ramped up. The less rational Iran acts, the higher the amount the US will have to spend until they back down."
"Okay, just wondering how much debt you're comfortable with before Iran backs down. 1 Trillion? 2 Trillion? Also, wondering how we're going to pay for that."
"Perhaps if you lot had minded you own business in 1953.

"Yeah, because the majority of people today were alive and of voting age <em>seventy fucking years ago.</em>"
Kinda like white people who owned slaves over 100 years ago have fuck all to do with white people today right?
"Not white people, Democrats. Free blacks were about 5 times more likely to own slaves in America than whites."
The only thing all slave owners had in common: Democrats. Every last one.
"Well of course, the parties swapped around the turn of the century"
What year did they switch?
It wasn't an instantaneous process but happened shortly after the civil war and was fairly finished by the early 1900s. Here's a lil history channel article I was able to pull up on it relatively early but you should be able to find more sources everywhere if you're interested in more digging. It was part of the American history curriculum in my state when I went to high school but idk how recent it was added

"Ok so then in the 1920s when the ""Progressive Movement"" came to power under Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, and he immediately put into affect the segregation laws which ensured blacks could use the same facilities as whites, that was after the switch, so that was today's Democrat party?"
"Also in the 1930s when Democrat President FDR put a KKK member in the supreme Court and obstructed Jewish refugees fleeing Germany from entering America, that was today's Democrat party?"
"And in the 1950s when Republicans were trying to introduce the civil rights Act and the Democrats were trying to block it, that was today's Democrat party?"
Or the African slave peddlers who sold said slaves to white countries
The reason western democracies work is because the govt of today is responsible for the actions of previous administrations.
"Yeah, I’m sure today’s Iranian leadership remember when a Soviet-backed communist autocrat got removed by the CIA for an American-backed royalist autocrat. Get real."
"The overthrow of Mossadegh was supported by the Islamist hardliners, including a young Ayatollah Khomeini."
"As he is the leader who lead the overthrow of the shah, there is a direct link from us interference in 1953 to the leaders today"
"Perhaps if you lot had minded your own business in 1919 and not drew a bunch of arbitrary lines in the Middle East that didn't reflect cultural and religious communities, just your own imperial interests (and the French's), none of this would have happened. "

Wait you mean to tell me Iran didn’t back off after the previous administration bribed them? LoL
"I don’t think they did, did they?"
"On twitter I saw someone say, ""how is slapping someone in the face deterrence?""  It's just going to make them mad!   The proper context is when someone has been slapping you continually and you've been asking them to stop, and they don't.  Then slapping them in the face is deterrence, because it's the option you have left."
"For the last 20 years Iran has been pushing against US interests in the region which don't affect Iran.  Iran has their own Shia agenda, their own Anti-Israel, anti-Sunni agenda.  They are sending arms to Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Lebanon, etc, and have been for a couple decades."
The current issues didn't start with Trump.  It started 20 years ago when Iran got the idea to create its own regional hegemony.
correction: Internet shills when one EXTREMIST Iranian general dies
Lmao
I don't get who's shilling for whom anymore.
Moral equivalence crap is the type of logic 5 year olds use.  I get different influences impact cultures differently.  It still doesn't excuse away basic value judgments as an adult.  
"Iran has a campaign to take over and expand their Shia religion and their particular brand of tribalism/authoritarianism.  They do it by openly planning to kill children, civilians, etc.  This is why they are in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, etc.   It's Iranian Imperialism."
it’s crazy how gay rights is now a conservative value. what has happened to this country?
Everybody deserves their individual Rights. Conservatives strongly believe in and support individual Rights. This should come as no surprise.
so do conservatives support traditional values or liberal individual rights? these things are irreconcilable.
"I'm not a conservative, but it seems to me you can be against gay marriage while also being against gay people getting murdered for being gay."
they don’t do that as often as you think
"Yes they do. Your impression of the average conservative is what you've been told on the internet, but in real life, we aren't as evil as they would have you believe. I personally know hundreds of people who have a very similar view to me, that homosexuality is wrong, but that doesn't mean we discriminate against homosexuals. The worst reaction most of them would ever have towards a gay person is discomfort, similar to how one would feel around someone that swears very frequently. Its uncomfortable but it won't stop me from having a normal interaction with this person."
"Edit: I'm sure there are many people that react very strongly towards gay people and I'm not claiming they don't exist, but don't use them as the poster child for conservatism."
Which Party freed the slaves? Republicans. 
Which Party filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act? Democrats. 
Get over yourself.
"nice so the GOP are a liberal warhawk party, thank you for agreeing with me."
GOP president reagan legalized no fault divorce in california and gave amnesty to millions of illegals in the 80’s.  divorce and amnesty are also conservative values too right?

"Reagan was great, but he wasn’t perfect and isn’t a god. Relax."
The Republican party is the party of <em>classical</em>-liberal individual rights. 
"The Democrats are the party of socialism, you know, one of the most socially conservative movements to ever exist, and a movement which put homosexuals into concentration camps in every single country where it got power."
You guys are currently out there praising a government that kills gays and executed 1500 protesters just a few weeks ago. Don't pretend for a minute that you represent anything other than evil.
There's no such thing as gay rights. It's just citizens' rights. My rights are no different than homosexuals' rights.

In what American conservative movements do gays not have the right to peacefully exist?  Come the fuck on.

A dynamic mother and father figure are a very important thing for a growing developing child. Reality is homophobic.

I think anyone would rather have two loving same gendered parents than an awful mother and/or father.
Gay couples kind of fall into that pattern when they settle.

"I mean, people aren't idiots. The Media has spent a few years calling him an 'Isolationist'. Attacking him for not confronting the army of the NATO ally Turkey. Attacking him for not responding to Iran's provocations. It's extremely obvious that literally any option he had chosen to do, or not done anything, would have been attacked. "
"It's clear he didn't exactly <em>seek</em> this. It's a very reasonable, measured and proportional response."
Um... go to Reddit popular.  People are definitely idiots.

"I think the fact that this was a terrorist leader, notwithstanding his rank in the Iranian army, and that he has coordinated attacks against U.S. assets, the most recent being the Iraq embassy attack, and appeared to be planning more attacks, lends a little substance to the need to take him out. "
"N Korea hasn't done things of this nature yet, afaik, nor have many of the other bad people out there. As long as they don't, I agree that we should use other means to deal with them. "
"But if they start attacking us, then I have no problem defending ourselves."

Just 8 percent said that the strike would make it less likely, while 20 percent said that it would make it neither more or less likely. "
Bush and Obama were more afraid of him as as a dead Martyr than alive so they didn't do it. We will see how that shakes out with retribution but I think more disapproval stems from doing it in Iraq and not briefing Gang of 8.

<strong>Article:</strong>
"The magazine Christianity Today—which bore the imprimatur of its founder, Billy Graham —once arguably represented the broad middle of “American evangelicalism.” But a recent editorial calling for President Trump’s removal through impeachment confirmed the magazine’s creep toward that Slough of Despond populated by liberal elites and Joe Biden."
"The article cleared its throat—and conscience—by declaring “unambiguous” the “facts” of the president’s guilt. Having thus defenestrated objectivity, the editorial cited his behavior in general as “profoundly immoral,” his character as “grossly” so."
"But these subjective pronouncements promote a perversion of Christian doctrine, which holds that all are depraved and equally in need of God’s grace. For Christianity Today to advance this misunderstanding is shocking. It isn’t what one does that makes one a Christian, but faith in what Jesus has done."
"The reason for the editorial is that evangelicals pronounced Bill Clinton unfit for office because of his moral failings. Thus, claim Mr. Trump’s detractors, evangelicals are hypocrites who’ve sold their souls for political power unless they issue a withering philippic against Mr. Trump. Christianity Today’s long-faced essay is meant to be that dressing-down, triggered by the “facts” of the impeachment."
"But does the Clinton “character” comparison make sense? Aren’t the political realities different two decades later? The triangulating practicality and moderation of the Democrats under Mr. Clinton have been trampled beyond recognition by something untethered and wild, like horses racing to Venezuela."
"In the 1990s some Democrats were antiabortion. Neither party could exclusively claim the high ground on this deepest of moral issues. Mr. Clinton spoke of making abortion “safe, legal, and rare.” No longer. Despite ultrasounds and 4-D imaging, Democrats endorse abortion with near unanimity, often beyond viability and until birth. If slavery was rightly considered wicked—and both a moral and political issue—how can this macabre practice be anything else? How can Christians pretend this isn’t the principal moral issue of our time, as slavery was in 1860? Can’t these issues of historic significance outweigh whatever the president’s moral failings might be?"
"The pejorative du jour is to call evangelicals “transactional,” as though buying a loaf of bread and not simply praying for one were somehow faithless. But what is sneeringly called “transactional” is representational government, in which patriotic citizens vote, deputizing others to act on their behalf for the good of the country. Isn’t it conceivable that faithful Christians think Mr. Trump is the best choice?"
"But some left-leaning evangelicals long ago grew tired of being portrayed as jug-headed rubes and prudes. After Mr. Clinton’s acquittal, these Christians opted out of the “culture wars,” pretending it possible merely to “preach the Gospel” and avoid politics. They gave the good family man Barack Obama a mulligan or two, winking at his repudiation of traditional marriage and his dehumanizing unborn children."
"In this genuinely transactional compromise, Christians supporting Mr. Obama missed the moral forest for the trees. Now, in calling for Mr. Trump’s removal, they are missing the haystack for the needle. Can those troubled by Mr. Trump not at least imagine that removing him could lead to something even worse? Can the Democratic metamorphosis into an openly antiborder, socialist movement responsibly be ignored?"
"The stakes are therefore even higher than in 2016, not least because many are rightly scandalized at the attempts to undo that election. Perhaps voters could be excused for hoping to pry Old Glory from the grasp of unelected J. Edgar Hoovers at the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
"Christians especially blanch to see religious liberty—once thought settled under Mr. Clinton with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993—suddenly under serious attack. Christians are staggered to see good souls who stand by millennia-old religious convictions portrayed as deplorable bigots. Democrats—and many Republicans, too—simply look away, seemingly resigned to a culturally Marxist future in which they too may at any minute be rent asunder by woke mobs."
"Given this new reality, is it any wonder Mr. Trump’s bellicosity often draws cheers? Or that the appointment of originalist judges has become so urgent that some people are willing to countenance a chief executive who tweets like a WWE figure?"
"For those of us alive to this strange moment in history, arguments that this president’s inchoate moral failings somehow require his removal from office seem not only disproportionate, but preposterous. Christians worship a man who flipped over the tables of corrupt money changers and drove them from the temple with a whip he fashioned for that purpose. Or must one now assume Jesus was an angry white male without access to mental-health care?"
"The editors of Christianity Today have made the mistake of “straining at a gnat but swallowing a camel.” Since most evangelicals concur with Abraham Lincoln in seeing America as “the last best hope of earth,” it should hardly be discomfiting or shocking that they would rally behind a president with the fortitude to defend that vision of America."

Everyone of Hillary Clinton's staff involved with her email server lied to the FBI including Huma.  They all got immunity for it.  What a travesty of justice.
The right thing for Trump to do is to force the FBI to release the exculpatory evidence that Flynn's lawyer has and can't use because it hasn't been declassified.
"He will, he needs to get the Senate to kill impeachment first."
"They've yet to hit anything or kill anyone.  So I imagine this is something of a little face saving on the Iranian regime, something to the effect of ""We have fired our glorious missiles and struck the Great Satan on his own bases!""  When all they've managed to do is blow up a storage shed or two."
"Now, if they were targeting something or actual troops and they apparently can't hit the broad side of a barn, then this is going to go much worse for them than anyone expected."
"They aren't suicidal, imagine the response if they hit something and killed troops/destroyed critical assets"

"Iran, not the Democrats?"
Looks to me like Iran is following the John Kerry playbook on how to draw the US into a war and weaken Trump’s chances of winning re-election.

So culture sites will be destroyed soon. 52 of them. One for each state and PR and Guam.
But wait - obozo said we had 57 states. I'm confused...

"Saddam was tried, convicted, sentenced to death, lost his appeals, and was finally hung by the Iraqi judicial system."
Also in fairness I think if given the opportunity Hilary would have killed any of those people too. And then Jeffrey Epstein too.
Nobody here really killed anybody...that we know of.
I have no information on any crimes that could lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton.

Actually the Iraqis killed Saddam Hussein by hanging him.
Man that was a wild game of hangman
Sure but the yanks were the ones that found the fucker
"To be fair, Hilary has killed <em>far</em> more people than just Jeffrey Epstein."
and Bill Clinton has raped far more people than just Monica Lewinsky.
I'm no fan of Clinton's but he did not rape Fatty McCigarcunt.  That chick was a very willing partner.
According to the left's standard it was rape because she was unable to consent due to the power differential.
Indeed.  That's precisely it.
They won't admit it in HER case...but they demand it in everyone else's case.
Republican boss sleeps with willing subordinate?
THAT'S RAPE!

What the fuck happened to conservatives
This is the sort of shit you'd see your grandma post on facebook
Only one of my grandmothers was this funny.  The other one was a more serious person.
I miss other fiscal conservatives who just left out personal social issues because government should focus on defense and the economy not trying to shape people's personal lives and social issues.
go ahead post a fiscal meme we wont stop you (maybe automod will stop it for review )
I'm not laughing about the deficits and growing debt nothing changes in that regard no matter whos in charge and both parties are out of control with their spending.
I'm sure you super miss the fiscal conservatives that you are always indicating that you are kin to in your reddit comments.....
Libertarianism is not the same as conservative
"Fiscal conservatism is an absolute meme, and the fact that it is such a widespread belief among conservatives that it raises some concerns. And there is no point explaining to fiscal conservatives what 90% of economists already agree on or why ""fiscal conservatism"" is even an empty word and it's pointless to discuss it, but it is impossible to explain grade 1 economics to you lads because you just had faith in it for years or decades, and none of you would ever let a few facts disturb your ""reasoning"". Then you always go and blame the ""deep state"" or whatever for why your stupid ideology does not align with reality."
"American politics are great, both sides have 0 actual clue about economics."
"This place has turned into the_donald. Even as a person on the left there used to be some rational discussions here. Now it is just shit reposted from the cesspit of T_D. If I were an actual conservative i'd right this place off as a lost course, just like <a href=""/r/politics"">/r/politics</a>."
You seem really concerned.
Would you like to share more?
"Yeah, I don't want to judge a whole sub based on one post but this is just sad."
You know... the left totally lost its sense of humor.
This post is a laff.  It really is.  It's funny.
But the left has lost all of its humor.  It's sad...but also expected.
"Oof, if you think this is funny then I’m afraid to say you’re the one that’s lost a sense of humor. Usually there’s a punchline to jokes other than ‘Hillary bad’"
"Seriously, lighten up."
Really.  It's a laff riot for you to lecture others about what gave them a giggle.
Lighten up doesn’t really make an unfunny joke funny mate... no matter what gives you (personally) a giggle.
Did downvoting me make you happy?
Are you so upset that others  might think that this is funny?
Are you the humor police?
"Oh I’m sorry, are you offended? Did I offend you by calling you out for being predictable and unfunny? Maybe next time you should try actually being funny... hard ask I know but give it your best"
It's a sad that fact that about 1/4th of the population doesn't have a sense of humor.
Usually there’s a punchline to jokes other than ‘Hillary bad’
Almost all of the posts on political humor are “Trump bad” and most of them don’t even have a punchline.
"We're having a laugh, same as usual."

I wish we didn't, but the admins refuse to actually step in and do their job, so this is what we have to do."
"That's only on the threads flaired with ""Conservatives Only,"" which this post is not, and it's why you see unremoved dissident comments in this thread."
Can I comment here to point out Hillary Clinton was part of the National Security team that killed Osama?
That's totally canceled by her being the one to get all those people in Benghazi killed so no.

"Damn, how long is Hillary Clinton going to live in y'alls heads?"
As long as we fear her wrath.  You never really know when Hilldawg might come for ya!
"How long is a major political figure for the past 28 years that not only represents everything we see as wrong in American Politics, but is also married to a rapist (and I'm not talking about Lewinski) that, as president, signed into law the framework that is still used in attempts to rip away human rights going to be a punchline to jokes? As long as it's still funny to joke about the wastes of oxygen."
"Besides which, I still see people bitch and moan about Reagan in the usual left-wing hotspots (in between pathetic screeds and conspiracy theories about Trump, of course) and that dude hasn't been politically active since before the Clintons were big players. You're asking people that pay attention to politics why they joke about political figures. It's a stupid question."
I have a theory that it was all the top people that worked together in order to do it. That way it would be harder to trace and easier to point blame

"jesus christ i wish you ppl would shut up about hillary, we libs are tired of seeing her ugly face you guys are obsessed"
Why are <em>you libs</em> in <em>our</em> subreddit complaining about what we post here?
"honestly, i wanted to come here to see another side of debate. imagine my disappointment when it's 99% memes about how liberals are stupid."
"To be fair, we wish people would shut the Fuck up about Trump. A lot of sub reddit’s have become “oRaNgE mAn bAd” circle jerks and i hate seeing subreddits i used to like become just stupid. Us conservatives would appreciate if you people would shush as well. But we both know for a fact it’s just not going to happen eh?"
"i agree. i'm all about criticizing the policies and actions and (of everyone, not just the people i am not politically aligned with ) not trying to win with memes."
i've found that there are likely just as many fucktards on both sides (i also hate 'sides')
"We need more people like you, the circle jerks are all annoying. No matter their political affiliation. Also I agree, there’s fuckheads on both sides. Neither side is an angel."
"Well trump is the president, id be worried if people weren’t talking about him."
"Valid point, will give you that. However, there’s no denying that a good chuck of subreddits have been “Lol trump stupid gimme updoot” and it’s ruined way to many subreddits. There isn’t really any denying that tbh. It’s been the same damn joke for 3 years and people still make them and get thousands of upvotes.  Gets annoying."

I'm sorry we made you libs get triggered by her face tonight.  But we kind of enjoyed the meme.
"you have to admit, her cackle face is scary and hard to look at..."
I want to get ahead of this.  OP didn’t kill himself either.
3/4 of these people fucked up pretty badly in the Middle East. Hopefully Trump doesn´t escalate things too far with Iran so we keep it that way.
"I don't care who made it, who says what about it or what your political view is, this is funny. If my opinion offends you please feel free to downvote me into oblivion. I just don't care anymore."
For a moment let’s ignore the many obvious ties between Trump and Epstein than you guys are wilfully ignorant enough to ignore.
"But Holy shit you guys are <em>still</em> obsessed with Hilary Clinton? This is some super cringe shit. It’s been 3 years, like when does the obsession end? It’s just freaking tragic at this point."
Dude it's a meme.  Nuke another Hot Pocket and lighten up.

Al Baghdadi? completely forgotten
the murder of epstein isn't given the credit it deserves.
"it was the first genuine act of bipartisanship in the usa in years. corporate elites from across the aisle came together to hide their evil, indulgent, bourgios abuse crimes from the world."
and I think that's just beautiful...  can't let clinton get all the credit for something so magical.
Don’t forget the ambassador!
So stupid how conservatives keep pushing this but ignore his connections with Trump AND attorney general William Barr. He died under the custody of the justice department ran by Barr who has shown he’s made it his #1 duty to protect and defend Trump under any circumstance. But sure blame hillary because her 70+ year old husband being accused of being involved in Epstein’s sex crimes was going to hurt her ...how exactly?
"To be fair, they all killed Epstein.  "
"You guys seem to forget that the Clintons are not the end of the food chain.  In fact, Trump Org and the Clinton Foundation sit comfortably together in middle management.  That's why they launder money hack and forth thru each other."

She didn't get THAT far by admitting to her crimes.

"To be fair, The Babylon Bee in satire is still more accurate than CNN."
"Babylon Bee, like the onion, will be even more relevant in a few years as the left continues to lose their mind."
"Yeah I have to check for the Bee on some articles that are actually true, just to make sure they aren’t satirical and the dems are in fact trying to impeach/no longer trying to impeach/whining about white people/sympathizing with terrorists/etc"
True dat my friend. How could this not be taken as satire? The only time Democrats talk about our flag is to remind people that they have a right to burn it. Legal citizen or not.
At least the bee has the decency to say they are being satirical. CNN not so much.
"When the Bee gets more traffic than you... hang it up, folks."
He handles disinformation 😂
"The poor boob is actually sounding the alarm—too late, as it happens—over the general contempt in which partisan news outlets like CNN are held by most Americans."
Yep.
He's all up in arms because the conservatives DARE to have a satirical site.
"On the flipside, this poor boob is a total fan of The Onion.  "
"They're hypocrites, even with satire."
"Most 'journalists' these days do nothing more than concern-troll their way through their job, trying to get whatever thing they're simply calling attention to de-platformed."
"The Bee has to keep making its articles more absurd, because subtle satire skirts too close to what the Democrats are actually doing."
Key takeaway and why they are really mad:
"""The Babylon Bee was getting more traffic on that one article than his network (CNN) and The New York Times get weekly."""
I love it!
Guess who will be the next target of The Babylon Bee?
The modern equivalent of getting Rick-rolled is finding out you just fact checked the Bee.
And just the fact that a satire piece got the same amount of click as CNNs top story in one week. Only if these people were more socially aware and didn't blame EVERYTHING on everybody but themselves.
The comments section in there is getting pretty intense...
"As always, don't get complacent. Get out and vote as it's the only poll that matters and the only poll I've ever taken."
"OK, so it's going to be about.....a gain of 3 EVs?"
Are you complaining?
"Errhh......I had hoped it would be something like 9-12 EVs, but I guess anything helps, and it sure beats a loss."
"With how blue Florida is becoming these days, though, especially with ex-felons now being allowed to vote, it's a good chance it will actually turn into the next Virginia; a light blue state. So instead of 3 EVs, it might just be a gain of 1-2."
Sigh......I wish there had been a mass exodus of Republicans from California to Texas the past few years. Enough to drop California by five and gain Texas five.
"Texas is turning pretty purple, too, though."
That has been happening. California movers voted for Cruz at a higher rate than native Texans. Texas is turning blue this decade because of Hispanics.
"Be careful when making assumptions about census projections. Even though the states gaining seats might be <em>traditionally</em> Republican, that status may quickly change when one considers mass immigration and the mass exodus from states like NY and California. The real political fight is taking place in the suburbs right now."
The problem is that Texas and Georgia will turn purple in a decade or 2 and then possibly blue given demographic changes.  They will both gain electoral votes so when those leave the red column it is going to be hard to reach 270.  Trump won with an excess of 34 votes.  TX &amp; GA will be 52+ votes by then.
They are both supposed to go blue this decade. Republicans realistically only have until 2028 to win any presidential election ever again
That's pretty scary to think about not having a conservative voice for half the country.
Yep and it's all because of the 1965 immigration act. Every non-white group votes 70%+ Democrat and that has never changed. It's inevitable unless something is seriously changed like in the next 3 years
Republicans realistically only have until 2028 to win any presidential election ever again
Remember after 2012 when they did the electoral autopsy? It was all doom and gloom and look at where we are now.
"People's minds change, the issues that are a priority change, etc."
"Look at the demographics dude. No minority group has voted more than 35% Republican in recorded history. And the only group that got up to 35% was Hispanics in one election for Bush, otherwise its around 30-25% for Hispanics and Asians and 10% for blacks."
I understand your point and I'm not saying that you're wrong. I'm just pointing out that this shit isn't an exact science and things can change so just because the trend appears a certain way today doesn't mean that things will continue
"True. I could imagine a scenario where whites become a monolith vote in response, currently whites vote like 60% Republican but I could see an increase to like 80% or something to be a way to push back that time"
"Yup, yup."
I think it will take longer than that.  First they need to go purple.  If you look at the vote history of TX in presidential elections for the past few cycles the dem share has increased but only very little.  The notable trend in 2016 was that a bigger share went to 3rd party candidates away from Republicans.  The vote for HRC was about the same as for Obama.    
"While Beto got close to Cruz, all the other statewide races were not close.    "
What they could do in Texas after 2020 is switch their electoral college allocation to congressional district like NE &amp; ME.  It kind of has to be soon because Dems are close to taking the state house and they might not go for it.  Basically that means Republicans will still get their share of the TX electoral votes instead of losing them all in the future.  They can afford to lose some.    
Of course Dems could reverse that down the line but it could take a fair amount of time for them to get unified control to do so.
I’ve already got a bet on that Trump will win more than 400 EC votes.
I hope you didn't put a lot of money on that because there's no way Trump can get to 400 EVs without carrying a state like New York or California.
"CA + NY is 84, there’s still 454 EC votes outside of those two states.... it’s <em>possible</em>! Reagan did it."
"I mean, it's possible, but that would be like me winning Mega Millions. I'd believe it if Trump's approval rating were 75%, not 45%.  "
"Clinton, Bush and Obama couldn't do it. Trump isn't exactly getting extra support."
"Every time the Mega Millions goes off, the person who wins it had as little chance of winning it as you do."
"There is no way that Washington, Oregon, and Virginia will go to Trump"
"You're a brave man.  I think he will win again in November, but given his approval rating, I'd be shocked if he crested 350 votes."
"Let's assume he keeps all the states he won in 2016, where is he going to gain 96 votes from?  He already won most of the swing states.    "
"The swing states that Clinton won were CO, NH, NV &amp; VA.  Of those Trump could win NH &amp; NV.  That's 10 votes.  Minnesota was close so that could swing.  That's another 10 votes.  That puts him at 324.  "
"Even if he got CO, VA, ME &amp; NM. That puts him at 355.  "
From there on out you're needing to swing blue states where the margin was over 10%.  That's really hard because the ones between 10-17% don't yield 45 votes - only about 35.  After that you need to be swinging states where the margin is insane.
"Maybe, maybe not. With Trump, nothing is impossible - he’s already demonstrated that in 2016. Remember how pretty much everybody said he had <em>no path</em> to 270? "
"I know it’s unlikely, it’s a long shot. That’s why I got such good odds 😎"
The only way that will happen is if he takes the Big Blue.  But wouldn't it be sweet.
"No, I think it’s doable in a few different ways, it’s not out of the question at all. I think it’s a long shot but totally doable. And yes it would be so sweet, made sweeter by me winning hundreds of dollars!! 😎"
I think it's very unlikely but maybe more likely than winning the popular vote. Republicans are still adopting the strategy of doing nothing and abandoning the cities. Where is the GOP's ground game?
Is there a good site to forecast the EC wins based off swing state wins with the current swing%s?
Is there a good site to forecast the EC wins based off swing state wins with the current swing%s?
"<a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-in-a-landslide-this-historically-accurate-model-predicts-exactly-that-2019-10-15"">Moody's Analytics has predicted that Trump will win in several scenarios.</a>"
"I don’t know, my reasoning wasn’t backed up by any kind of calculations, just #MAGA dragon energy kind of thing 😎"
"lol, I think he will win as well. I just didn't know how the math played out."
"I <em>almost</em> bet on him to win in 2016, but didn’t - I opened an online betting account to do it, but I don’t bet so I was a bit wary of how it works and I never placed the bet. So I’m kicking myself about that, making sure I get my money down this time! 😊"
"I wanted to bet against some cocky (democrat) family, but I neglected to get anything set up in time."
Hope many states changed their electoral to popular vote? I'm pretty sure Washington and a few other states did.
That'll last until someone they don't like (cough cough Trump) wins the popular vote.
"Effectively, none of them. They all had the clause that the PV thing only takes effect when a threshold number of other states also pass the same legislation, they haven’t reached the threshold. "
"My favourite scenario is blue states passing this thinking it will allow other states to vote against Trump, but Trump actually <em>wins</em> the PV and this legislation forces the blue states to vote for Trump instead. At which point of course they’ll throw it out and vote blue anyway, everybody knows they will."
This is what I was hoping for as a WA resident. Lol
Blue states don't have enough votes to carry it over the finish.  They could probably get it to 220 votes or so.  At that point onwards it needs red or swing states.  They would only sign on if they saw it benefited them.    It's not going to happen when Trump is still in the equation.  It would have to be after a few more cycles and some red states like Texas and Georgia had turned purple and gone Democrat for a cycle or something.  At that point it would be easier for Republicans to win the popular vote.
It won't matter.

This matters only if the petition is signed by enough states so they can circumvent electoral college. Otherwise they might be signing their own doom.
Yep.
"I read last year that this petition was vetoed by some smaller States (some of them blue), because their voters voice would be disenfranchised."
I recall that Nevada's Democrat Governor vetoed the bill to circumvent the electoral college.
"What kind of dogshit proposal is that? What if Oregon votes heavily for the Democrat, but the country votes for the Republican? The state is basically saying they dont give a shit what their citizens voted for..."
Hence the fact that the proposal is blatantly unconstitutional.
The constitution says the state chooses how to allocate their votes.  The SC has said this power is exclusive and plenary.
"Look at it a different way.  Under winner takes all, if a state votes 51% for party A, 49% for party B then all of that state's votes go to party A.  "
Under a national popular vote then all votes count for the same no matter where they are cast.  They count towards the national total.  The one with the most votes wins.  Everyone in every state will have had their vote count towards the national total.  
"What you are doing is now playing the game under the old rules and saying, well look here the votes of this state would be different if we used the old system.  Like why would you do that?"
Anyone who does not understand or support the electoral college is an enemy to this country and how it has preserved freedom.
"It actually favors Republicans to go to a national vote. Most Republicans I'm blue states don't vote...but if their vote suddenly mattered, you'd get a 30-40% increase in turnout in California and New York."
I don't change a good system because changing the rules would favor me...that would make me a Democrat
"You could make this argument about democrats as well. Most democrats in heavily red states might not have bothered to vote and will start voting. From a statistical perspective, I would be interested to know how the data would play out. I am not willing to compromise our elections to satisfy that urge, however."
"Just wait until Oregon votes blue, but the US popular vote is red... that law will change real quick."
"I strongly suspect that if this national popular vote compact passes in enough states, it will be ruled <a href=""https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/the-danger-of-the-national-popular-vote-compact/"">unconstitutional </a>."
"It's not even a little bit of a question in my mind. It's on its face unconstitutional. They want to change the electoral college, pass an amendment. Everything else is just a bunch of noise from some bitchy sore losers."
"Well obviously it <strong>is</strong> unconstitutional. But until Trump appoints another SCOTUS justice, I’m not certain it would be <strong>ruled</strong> unconstitutional, sadly. "
Let’s all just make sure Trump wins the popular vote <em>and</em> the electoral college in 2020 to be safe. 😎
"There's already existing precedent on the books that kills this entire movement.  10th Circuit held in Baca v. Colorado Department of State that states restricting an elector's choice or removing them for not voting the way they're directed is a violation of the 12th amendment.  It's been appealed to SCOTUS, but it's good law for now."
"Well, right now there’s only 14 states plus DC signed on, so it won’t matter for another few election cycles. "
"Long-term, though, for republicans to win elections they need to gain more popularity. In terms of values, the hispanic-American population has the most in common with the Republican Party base, but the sticking point continues to be widespread perception of racism coming from the GOP."
"I’m not saying republicans are racist, because that’s beside the point - Most immigrants are more conservative than average. The problem is that a large segment of the population is being held back from voting they they want because of the perception of racism."
"I've lived in two minority-majority communities for the majority of my life. One community was Hispanic, the other Asian. Both communities are very much more conservative than the average white American. But they don't vote because Republican messaging does not include them. Republicans have disenfranchised a game changing amount of their potential voting base."
It is starting to change at the state level.  Republicans in CA have started fielding Asian Americans in some districts.  They fared not bad even if they didn't always win.  It's been shown that the loyalties of Asians isn't set and can be reached.  
"In the US, the Democrat party relies on minority votes as one of their 3 pillars as they lose working class whites.  In the UK, the Labour party also lost working class whites but they couldn't make up the difference with minorities because in the UK, minorities are not tied to the Labour party but do in fact vote for the Conservative party.    "
"So I agree with you, there is an easy road to success here.  Some Democrat policies actually hurt Asians eg. school admissions.  It wouldn't really cost Republicans anything to support Asians on this."
They are “mourning” because if they don’t the government will round them up and execute them.

A $20,000 State tax write off doesn't benefit the typical middle class family living in a 2 bedroom apartment or a modest house.  Essentially the Act would require the rest of the country's taxpayers to underwrite this kind of regulatory and governmental madness in high tax states like CA and NY. "

"Laws need to be as precise as possible and not be worded arbitrarily so they can be used a blanket that applies to numerous instances. That just causes confusion, outrage, and possibly more work because one judge finds it okay and another doesnt."

"Arrested/charged for murder. Given a 750k bond, bondsman might charge 5-10% so about 37k+ , bond reduced to 12K and bondsman chage  600? If I got released on bond for 600 and I know I did it, I am gone. Am I missing something?"
Nope that's all and that's exactly the point. Why these people want criminals out on the streets walking free is beyond me but that's their goal.
12k for murder ? that means pretty much anyone doing an average wage in New York can kill one person a year and face pretty much no consequences. Are they fucking insane ?

"Bail, not a get out of jail for free card. Although it shouldn’t matter how much you make..."
I can't believe how stupid people are.
The issue is not that the amount of bail was reduced. It was that bail was for whatever reason given in a crime like that.
$750k means he isn't getting out on bail unless the family is wealthy.  10% for a bondsman is too much for almost anyone to pay outright.  
And I doubt they are going to put their home up to cover the full bail themselves.
"Staying out of jail based on how wealthy you are is fucking dumb anyway. Make bail a +30% of your time sentenced, only those who know they’re innocent will take it"
The fact that he can get out says a lot.

Leftists: “We love diversity!” <em>Terms and conditions may apply.</em>

Having a political view doesn't make you diverse.
Diversity of thought is a thing. This includes political ideas.
"Fair. But neither liberals or conservatives have had to make great strides for basic rights or privileges. The reason diversity is generally a positive is it represents a group/organization that chooses its members by quality as opposed to fitting a set of characteristics, and more likely to be opposed to racist/sexist/etc. views. "
"A hospital that only employs people from one demographic will have less qualified doctors than one that does not consider demographic when hiring. Outside of hires specifically chosen to increase diversity, diversity typically represents greater competence."
But neither liberals or conservatives have had to make great strides for basic rights or privileges
Not true. Ideas have been getting people killed for a very long time.
"Great competence is found by just taking the most skilled members in a society, of course most will be different in many things such as race, sex or religion, but also political beliefs...."
"So anyone who doesn't employ any conservative OR liberal doctors will also do worse in general, in terms of their business and saving lives."
No-one is saying that diversity is a bad thing. There are just many kinds of diversity...
"Ok, so it sounds like we agree on that. I’m not saying diversity of thought is a bad thing either, for the same reasons I mentioned above. There are a lot less organizations refusing to hire people based on race/sex/religion than political beliefs, though."
"Well, there's many different kinds of thought, and your response didn't have much value since no-one was saying diversity in anything was a bad thing."
"Did you mean more organisations, and also, religion can often be tied to political beliefs, or at least seem that way..."
"And I think a corporation should be able to choose which employees it has, and fire them for any reason. You're paying someone money to a job, you should be able to have the choice to stop paying them if you want to. For whatever reason. That being said, being discriminated against sucks..."
"Another somewhat related point: Diversity is good, forced diversity is bad. I'd be happy to pray with anyone from any religion (depending on how it's done) but not if I was forced to..."
"We shouldn't force anything to become more diverse, we already have a natural order of things. For example, men and women are better at certain jobs, having a 50/50 split will make society less productive in general, same as having no women or no men at said jobs.."
"Your name looks really familiar, which is quite interesting. Have you come here before?..."
Bull shit.
"Conservatism is the epitome of human rights. It spits in the face of identity politics. You earn what you get and you are judged on your merit, nothing else. There is nothing fairer than that basic human right."
"Liberalism is the exact opposite. It seeks to put everyone into baskets based off of physical attributes. It then takes specific baskets and props them up with special privilege while labelling them ""victims"". Nothing is more insulting to human rights than liberalism. The irony is they claim to be the enlightened ones when they're just bigoted morons."
Your college professor(s) an idiot. Learn to think for yourself.
I don't follow your argument at all. The best argument for diversity is that you get different perspectives that can help with problem solving this is why the conservative exclusion is so bad.
"My point is a lack of diversity typically represents a biased organization. Going back to my hospital example, one that refused to hire men would be missing out on a large portion of skilled labor, and evidently cares less about saving lives than having their workers be women. If you used the most skilled labor in a population, your employees would generally match the population demographic, assuming rough equity in things like education. And for these same reasons, conservative exclusion is bad. Not super widespread, but still, other than political organizations, someone who says “I won’t hire you because you believe in small government” or whatnot is just being a jackass."
I don't think we have any disagreements here. As long as you let diversity come through the hiring of the best applicants regardless of race gender political ideology then you are good to go. If you end up with mostly female nurses though because women statistically are better caretakers and also are more interested in the job then don't force more men in. Here I think we agree as far as the protestors go though there are people excluded because of conservative viewpoints
diversity is generally a positive

I appreciate your user flair. I agree.
Because faith and political beliefs aren't the same thing. How is that not clear?
Theyre both important expressions of culture. How can I get any clearer than that? What makes them so different? You can change your religious beliefs as easily as you can change your political beliefs and vice versa. People do both all the time.
You're comparing political beliefs which you have full control over Vs something you're usually indoctrinated in. Or do conservatives have no control and can't help being conservative. 
Is being conservative an identity?

"Nothing makes ""you"" diverse. Diversity is any group that includes different types of people. Those types can be ethnic, religious, gender, political, or even non-religious, apolitical beliefs. And the goal of any diverse group is to have a varied set of opinions represented, or at least that's what makes diversity valuable. In other words, there is no point in having a multiracial group if everyone in that group shares the same beliefs, be they political or otherwise."
Wrong.

"“Although I am aware and respectful of the many dimensions within which a university properly seeks a diverse faculty and student body, I have long been particularly concerned with the lack of intellectual diversity at the law school. A survey of U.S. law professors in general found that white Democratic professors (both male and female), Jewish professors, and nonreligious professors ‘account for most (or all) of the overrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching.’ The groups that ‘account for most of the underrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching’ are Republicans (both male and female), Protestants, and Catholics. This disparity persists even though ‘religious and political diversity are probably more important for viewpoint diversity than gender diversity and roughly as important as racial diversity.’"
I really love how the departments which claim to care the most about diversity give you assignments such as analyzing literature from a small non-diverse set of perspectives like feminist or Marxist.

"one of the funny things about marxists (or a lot of left wing things in general) is that they constantly contradict their premises and goals. In order to help the average employee we must dis-incentivize employment. In order to be equal we must actively put down groups. In order to protect a woman's right to choose we must subvert the child's right to choose (and right to life, but we're going by the contradictions). Non marxists are anti-science but also claim that the scientific definition of life does not constitute a living being. We need to protect people's ability to speak by preventing others from speaking. We need to protect people by not letting them protect themselves. We need to make healthcare more affordable by forcing everyone to pay for it at all times, regardless of whether the service is of quality, you receive any benefit at all, and whether a shortage of doctors exists and needs to be remedied by increasing the benefit of becoming a doctor. We need more doctors, let's put a max limit on how many doctors are allowed to exist (look at the regulations in medicine, that shit needs to be reduced, it's just making the market inefficient and uncompetitive). We need diversity of ethnicity in order to bring a new perspective, but we can't have people who disagree with us politically."

Uh... ok? What something is supposed to be and what something is are two different things.
"I have a friend at work, who briefly lived in Canada. She always insists “their free speech is the same as ours”. I try to tell her otherwise but it seems she will always buy into it’s okay to silence people as long as you disagree with them"
"The ""<strong>Canadian Human Rights Tribunal</strong>"" proves that they have no freedom of speech."
"Dean Steacy, one of Canada’s Human Rights Commissioners, said  “Freedom of speech is an American concept, so I don’t give it any value”."
"Freedom of speech is an American concept, so I don’t give it any value”"
"When Dean Steacy said this in 2008, he was correct and also referring to a portion of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) (section 13)  that has since been repealed in 2014 as the concepts are covered in the Charter of rights and Freedoms (chapter 2). This is a  much more powerful codification via constitutionality rather then an act of parliament. By the way, he (Steacy) was an investigator and not a commissioner. Also by the way, good riddance to the CHRA freedom of expression section. It was a horrrid piece of crap. At least now that the expression is protected under the charter, other protections such as freedoms of press, thought, expression and so on are also in step."
"Carrying on, what is missing from the statement above is the part that Steacy said right after. His full statement was  ""freedom of speech is an American concept, it is not a Canadian concept. A person stating that they were protected by ""freedom of speech,"" would be equivalent to somebody raising a 'freedom of expression' concept,"" which is protected under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms to a point."""
"So, your position that Canadians don't have freedom of speech is true but you leave a deception when you omit  the fact that Canadians have (finally) a superior freedom of expression."
​
The key here is that the cops were 100% wrong in claiming that there was a breach of peace here. This is not the error of law. It is totally an error of the police. The police need to be dragged into the 20th century and have the charter rights smacked into their thick heads.   
The freedom of expression in Canada is robust. Its just that all cops are bastards.

I edited my prior to add to the point that it wasn't the fact that the law was weak. Its the fact that all cops are bastards and they are enforcing rules that they made up.<br/>
Again, section 13 of the CHRA has been repealed in 2014. It was long overdue and a seriously flawed piece of trash. Today in 2020 we all have superior charter protection under freedom of expression.   "

Ultimately this disaster is totally the fault of the cops and not the charter. The cops are lying or ignorant or stupid. They have no legal basis to threaten an arrest and they should be held to account for their mistakes.
It is the cops fault that leftist politicians wrote a Stalinist anti free speech law.  Really?
The conservatives under Harper was the government that repealed section 13. A very good decision.

Not a good trend to see and it's difficult to stop it within the city because generally people lean Liberal or NDP.
Democrats and the leaders of Iran
"<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/yAhiU1f.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Haley / Rice 2024!</a>"
I think democrats are more concerned about a potential war -  and the potential to waste tons of money and lives - rather than suleimani
LOL! When have Democrat’s ever worried about wasting money?
"They typically don’t like wasting money in wars...they don’t care as much about wasting money on education, welfare, healthcare etc"
You use the word “wasting” on wars and “spending” on social programs. Tricky. I would argue that neither party likes “wasting” money on anything. Could also argue that some military spending is necessary and some welfare programs are wasteful. It’s all about what your priorities and ideals are.
Lol just noticed that and edited it so both are now “wasting” 😂
"Anecdotal, but Democrats were in power when the US entered the following wars: Mexican-American War, Civil War(they started it), World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Kosovo, Somalia."
"Conservatives have had their fair share of conflicts too, but to say Democrats avoid wars is at least historically not very correct."
Also Libya and Syria
"On the flip side it could have prevented a war, remember we had intelligence on Suleimani who had plans to hit many more US targets.  There is a strong case showing strength through decisive action was the better option here rather than sitting back and watching more loss of life due to this man.  There is <em>always</em> a potential war with Iran, this strike didn't change that.  However it is neither of our best interest to go to war, especially Iran...as they have a lot more to lose...and they will lose.  We showed Iranian leaders we have an invisible gun to the heads, and we aren't afraid of using that gun.  They are likely afraid of stepping out in the open air right now, as they should be."
This is a great way to look at it that Democrats are clearly shoving under the rug ....goddamn I just hope we don’t get into another war in the Middle East.
Tired of wasting money on that fucking sandpit.
"Yea, it’s also important to remember the democrats want a new war, or an economic recession, as either of those events increase their chance of winning the election.  Pretty terrible...and they’ll never admit it, but it’s the truth as their leaders and the media have let it slip."
"Are you sure about that? No president has lost re-election during wartime, and Trump himself suggested in 2011 that Obama would start a war with Iran to help boost his chances at re-election."
You are correct. The guy has close to no clue what he is talking about.
"""Democrats want war because it will help them win an election"" is my favorite take I've ever seen on this subreddit lmao. This is the polar opposite of true, wartimes almost unanimously benefit presidents going for re-election throughout history. Trump wants to start the war because it will benefit his re-election and corporations who benefit from wartime economies. Democrats are upset because they don't want that to happen."
Better to have actual action now rather than play it soft and have many more lives lost later.
But democrats had no problem trying to force a War with Turkey a much more powerful country than Iran who are also a NATO ally.

Here's an interesting report showing that many of the places that are suffering fires are where temperatures are below averages and that droughts are not getting worse in Australia.

"Man, I just hate facts sometimes..."
"No one is arguing that the fires were started by climate change except fucking idiots. However, they were exacerbated due to climate change."
"Really? Because everybody over at <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> is saying the fires were started due to climate change."
"Idk if we’re looking at the same comments but I don’t see a lot of people saying the fires were caused by climate change, and if they are saying that they’re idiots"

I said except for fucking idiots
[rushes to move goal posts]
"No no no, see what it REALLY is, is climate change merely led to the <em>intensity</em> and <em>severity</em> of those fires."
Their opinions have to be founded on facts in order for them to be influenced by new information. The climate change argument clearly isn't.
"Im a police officer in brisbane Australia, east coast north of where most of the fires have been. New reports are 150 fires were lit nation wide by 200+ persons, coordinated attacks. In our states arrested, 7 were Extinction Rebellion members previously arrested during public protests against climate change."
Extinction Rebellion
"So, let me understand this. Members of a climate change activist group are deliberately setting these fires?"
"And then they tweet things like <a href=""https://twitter.com/XRebellionAus/status/1213721737021386752"">this</a>. Nothing like creating your own crisis to fuel your own narrative. This is apparently an eco-Reichstag."
"Yeah, many are claiming it was accidental or that they were trying to do it to back burn, but there's sufficient evidence to indicate it has been a planned effort by multiple people in multiple groups (not all ER or other environmental groups, some were also groups of kids or online pyro groups)"
The frustrating thing is the media hasnt reported it. Its floating around our internal email system but if we go to the media with the story 1. The story will get buried anyway and 2. We lose our job.
It should have been obvious to everyone that climate change activists were doing this.
However what is surprising is how effective the lies and propaganda being spread about this are. You can only blame conservatives and their cowardice for letting that happen.
"This absolutely sucks for the Australians, it is bad enough when fires are being started naturally ( lightning, etc...) and your whole continent is on fire and then these pricks light more for fun. Imagine the destruction these people caused, hopefully they lock them away for a long time."
"I believe it's a prison sentence of 21 years for deliberately starting a fire or even being careless with a cigarette/cigar, etc. in Australia."
Its not sadly. 14 yrs max unless it causes death then its potentially life.. But life is 20yrs and no judge ever orders max sentencing.. And most are done by kids with the exception of the coordinated extinction rebellion fires.
See “man made” climate change is real.
I say hang them publicly.
"Or take them to the middle of the country, after the fires are put out, and then let them go and tell them if they can get back alive then they can just go back to jail. They'll make it...4 days at most."
I thought about that. Giving them a chance. Like make them work to rebuild or plant trees. But then it gives them a chance to escape. That would be disastrous if the did. It would be mocking everyone.
Burn them at the stake!...too soon?
Dude!!! Even better.
But at the Golden Globes didn't Patricia Arquette  say Trump caused the wildfires?
"BUT they were forced into action because of climate change, so fortunately the narrative is intact. "
I wonder how many are members of climate alarmist groups?
Didnt they cut funding on fire fighting also which is a big reason they are even in this mess to begin with?
Pretty sure. I think most of the firefighters are volunteers at this point. There was an article that said how the Australian PM hasn't been doing <em>enough</em> to fight climate change.
Hanging's too good for ‘em. Burning's too good for ‘em! They should be torn into little bitsy pieces and buried alive!
The thread on the front page about the fires is absolutely batshit insane. All of the comments are as follows
"•Corrupt asa government is making money off fires
•Fuck conservatives for denying science
•Who cares if <em>some</em> of the fire was started by people ""muh climate change""
•Fuck christians and right wing (that's right they blamed evangelicals)
•Murdoch is evil
•It's Trump's fault"
These people are so mentally unstable it's honestly scary.
And they like to think they represent everyday people.
Writes whole article explaining how arson caused fires.
Uses last 2 paragraphs to still try and blame climate change.
Yeah but that was be cause there judgement has been impaired due to the atmospheric changes occurring due to man mad climate change /s
"Climate change is real, but it's not responsible for things like this. Periodt. But let's push the agenda anyways! Pictures of baby kangaroos and koalas dead! Outrage! When it was arsonists..."
"Normally I don't read through an entire article since I think most of the authors get paid by the word. At least, that's my understanding of it. "
"So, it'll say something like, ""Current 2020 Democrat Presidential Front Runner Candidate, former Vice President to the 44th President of the United States of America Barrack Obama, former Delaware State Senator, Joe Biden  today..."""
"Rather than, ""Joe Biden today..."""
"But, this time I read the whole thing and didn't see anything about climate change. I half expected to see, ""While 24 people were arrested for deliberately starting fires, increased temperatures and lightning strikes caused by climate change still account for most of the fires."""
I'm glad some people are realizing it. Honestly the only people really pushing the climate change agenda about these current fires are celebrities on their social media accounts. Shocker. 🙄
You have to go watch Ricky Gervais light up Hollywood during his opening monologue if you haven't yet. 
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCNdTLHZAeo"">Here</a>"
"Best part is when he calls them all stupid, friends of Epstein, and hypocritical racists who think ""thoughts and prayers"" are enough to help Australia."
"Oh my god, I saw it a couple hours after it aired and it was gold. To see the elites of Hollywood clutching their pearls. It was actual art."
"I feel like the laughter is coming from most of the people in the cheap seats in the back. The people that aren't going to show up on camera because they aren't famous enough. But Tom Hanks's face the whole time is, ""WTF are we doing right now? Is this really happening?"""
"Jonathan Pryce's face is, ""I'm going to fucking kill you, Ricky."""
Most of them are awkwardly trying to keep a straight face though. 
"Somebody else noticed this great part, too. When Ricky mentions how people of color got snubbed, for the 4th? time now, he just explains it's because the Hollywood Foreign Press is extremely racist. And the cameraman zooms out to show how fucking white the entire room is. Classic!"
"Normally I don't read through an entire article since I think most of the authors get paid by the word. At least, that's my understanding of it. "
"If they are paid by the word, it's bulk rates, in that the publisher pays X amount for a 200 word entry, Y amount for a 500 word entry, Z for 1000, etc. And many times the publisher often cites what size article they are looking for."
"It's not a ""nickel per word"" kind of thing."
"Please point to predictions that actually came to pass. AlGore's slideshow is now a farce.

Don't be a 'useful idiot.' Think critically- why is it no matter the global phenomena the same ills are always at fault and the same solutions are always proposed?
I guess this would be man made change..lol
At least they like fire. Cuz thats all they gonna be getting.
"According to <a href=""https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/bushfires-firebugs-fuelling-crisis-asarson-arresttollhits183/news-story/52536dc9ca9bb87b7c76d36ed1acf53f""><em>The Australian</em></a>:"
"Police arrested 183 people for lighting bushfires across Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in the past few months. NSW police data shows 183 people have been charged or cautioned for bushfire-related offences since November 8, and 24 arrested for deliberately starting bushfires."
How dare you!
"Only 24 appear to be actual arson.  The rest are cases of negligence, some didn't result in damage.  E.g. using a cooking fire in a no-fire area.  I'm curious as to why there's so little info on the arsonists though."
"Yea that headline is highly misleading. It also doesn’t mean that all 24 actually did the arson, just that they were arrested for it."
"I believe I saw that around that number had been charged, and more were pending investigation. Can't back that up though."
"And remember kids, there is no time for due process. Trump is such an urgent threat to democracy and the USA, that impeachment against him cannot wait ! well except maybe a couple of months now that passed the house"
"Gavel drop:  Dismissed. I think he just wants to rub it in her face.  If she drags it out anymore, she'll be taking a couple of Senators out of the presidential race."
The duest of all processss
Good.
These rules are literally the same ones that got unanimous support during the Clinton impeachment. 
"Democrat opposition to these rules says far more about them and their ""case"" than anything else."
[deleted]
So...isn't this one branch (Congress) trying to control another equal branch (Senate)?
The House of Representatives and the Senate are <em>houses</em> of Congress.
The Congress is the Senate AND the House. 🤦🏻‍♂️
You are correct. I have removed my comment. She still has no control in the Senate.
Why wouldn't they want witnesses there? If Trump is innocent and did nothing wrong why try to obstruct the system if there is nothing to hide?
"Why? The Dems had control of the process in the House of Reps, ran a convoluted process, called their witnesses to public they decided fit their bill, claimed it was enough to vote on because it was such an urgent matter to get President Trump removed, but now are holding the articles from the Senate because they want more witnesses on their terms? "
"So which is it? Was the House of Reps so incompetent they voted on impeaching the president, with heavy and solum hearts as they said, without enough information to properly do so? Or are they trying to bury this thing in procedure to manufacture your civically insane, prove his innocence  bullshit?"
"See this is the issue with everything that's happened the last 3 years.  Some vague happening get thrown out by much less than credible sources, they are claimed credible, but you can't  see or hear or know about them.  Then the political process starts because it's such a dire and important matter. But when anything starts to fall apart everyone starts screaming for more process from the administration to prove their innocence.  Not how it works, never is how it worked, never should be how it works, and it's the most fucking scary thing I've seen."
"Mitch McConnell uses his office to enrich himself while his state is in the trash can. Kentucky has some of the lowest rates of education, health care, and employment in the country."
He’s a fucking turtle faced goon
Why does he block witnesses? Let them testify so we can give him due process. He blocks witnesses because he knows what those witnesses will say is damning to Trump. Stop obstructing justice McConnell
LOL
Let’s not let the truth stand in the way.
“Truth”
"It’s Bolton. If you want the GOP to rig the process just because you think the Dems did you’re acting like a child. This impeachment is not a complete sham. There definitely was some sketchy shit happening. For the American people not to get the truth is a big problem. No one should stand in the way, unless they are profiting from it. Let’s hear from everyone that has direct knowledge of what happened. Stop playing parties and grow up."
It’s Bolton. If you want the GOP to rig the process just because you think the Dems did you’re acting like a child.
Could have stopped right there.
"Let’s assume your premise is correct - what is the impeachable offense? The democrat talking point is that Trump was sabotaging Biden. Nevermind the fact that the democratic primaries haven’t even started, so Biden technically isn’t even a potential rival, but the fact that as each day goes by we get more and more news about his and his son’s dealings in Ukraine it becomes apparent that the president’s actions were legitimate. Even with a quid pro quo, it’s not like that concept is new or groundbreaking. We place contingencies on aid ALL THE TIME. This isn’t an impeachable offense. Let the voters decide."
"Yeah. Let’s let the voters decide, not the EC."
Clearly you don’t understand how republics work and the importance of protecting the minority. Try reading Federalist No. 68.
Clearly you don’t understand language. Try reading a book. He said voters. Voters don’t decide. Gerrymandering and EC do.
Direct democracy disenfranchises the minority. It’s mob rule. The EC is in place to stop that.
Aww. Is the poor liberal offended?
No one cares.
"If your comment is aimed at me, then one of us is confused.  My single word comment “truth” was aimed at those attempting to subvert American justice because of their hatred of POTUS.  "
"Also, did you notice how the other guy forgot to do the hand clappy 👏🏻 thing to let everyone know how serious he is?"
Nothing screams innocent like a defendant being able to instruct the jury to refuse to allow witnesses
"Weird, why didn't Democrats bring those witnesses up in the House?  They refused to allow the ""whistleblower"" as well, and blocked questions they said would expose his identity yet claimed they didn't know the ""whistleblower's"" identity.  You know, because they were <strong>lying</strong>."
"Instead, they had their donors ""testify""."
"Is this comment a joke? They <em>wanted</em> to call those witnesses in the House (Pompeo, Mulvaney, Perry) those witnesses were promptly instructed by the White House to not comply with the subpoenas. 
To your point on the Whistleblower, though I would like to see that testimony, Whistleblowers have the right to anonymity if they so choose, a right I believe we need to respect and uphold now and forever."
"And the House could have gone to court to compel testimony, yet they didn't.  But they demand the Senate do their job for them even though they were too lazy and incompetent to collect any evidence whatsoever?"
"You can't claim ""we need to respect the law"" and also ""we shouldn't subpoena Joe and Hunter Biden""."
"The ""whistleblower"" never heard anything himself. He heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who...  There is no testimony to give.  Trump released the call record."
And why do the Democrats lie about not knowing his identity?  Especially when Eric met with Schiff and his staff ahead of time?
"The fact that the Democrats refuse to send the impeachment to the Senate, and are already whining that we shouldn't use the exact same rules they used for Clinton's impeachment tells us all we need to know."
"They actually did take it to court via the case with WH Counsel Don McGahn (the judge ruled in favor of his testimony not being protected under Executive Privilege, the defense that the WH was putting forward). Also worth mentioning that the Attorney of Bolton and Mulvaney claimed that they would respect the precedent set by the McGahn ruling. So the attempt was there, just stifled by the WH."
"Subpoena the Bidens, I don’t give a shit. Do wrong? Get punished, I don’t care what your last name is. It was official US policy at the time of Biden’s trip to Ukraine for Shokin to be removed from his position, but if it’s the desire of the people for that be rehashed in court, so be it. "
"There’s nothing in the legal definition of Whistleblower that demands the information be firsthand. Additionally, aspects of the report were corroborated by testimony in court."
"Do YOU want the exact same rules from the Clinton Impeachment to be used? Because that would require a testimony under oath from Trump himself. There also was not extensive effort to block witnesses during the Clinton Impeachment, so to say that the context is the same is incorrect. Nonetheless, I’m fine with it, you know just as well as I do that Trump will never willingly testify under oath, so the likelihood of the same rules being used anyways are slim to none."
Clinton did not testify during his impeachment.  Try again.
You’re right. My bad. I was thinking of the testimony in 98 that birthed the perjury charge.
Its almost like discovering new information allows people to ask new questions or implicate new people
It's almost like you want a police state where prosecution has all the rights and the defendants have none.
"""We don't like orange man..he must be guilty and prove his innocence. AMERICA!!! REEE!!!!"" - The Left"
"First of all, the burden of proof isn't his. Secondly, you want a fair process? Run a fair process. The lack of self-awareness of the Dems here is just astonishing, the irony that they just presided over the most partisan impeachment of all time and then complained that the Senate was going to do the same isn't at all lost on me...."
Right?
"Like I've said, they're acting like a bunch of elementary school crybabies who want to change the rules to benefit them while they're playing the game."
"You clearly have no idea how impeachment proceedings work in a fair proceeding. But you aren’t interested in fair you’re only interested in taking the bad orange man out of office, reeeeeeeeeeee."
Screaming ree at someone way to take the high road on this.
"Dems ""imprachhheerss""
GOP "" no, go away"""
So.... Nothing bad happened yet no witnesses are allowed nor is the case allowed into the senate. Can someone comment some reasons why this is good because I don't see it
It seems like they would want witnesses there to clear up Trumps innocence.
Yeah that’s what Makes sense but they aren’t allowing it
"so predictable.  Show me the fact and I will tell you whether they will deny the fact, distort it, or censor it."

The left is so crazy now in the US I honestly am beginning to wonder does Israel actually pull the strings of our media? Meaning have they calculated that acting outraged about Trump via main stream media and paid twitter accounts to gain leftists support but then continue going further and further left to the point of insanity to guarantee a Trump 2020 reelection? The left is defending and honoring a state sponsored terrorist whose goal is death to Israel and death to America. It just doesn't make sense at all even for idiotic Democrats.
Just curious but don't most American funerals have a meal afterwards?
I dont really listen to much news. But is anyone saying the opposite of this?
Maybe I am really out of the loop.
"Haven't seen the opposite (what <em>would</em> be the opposite of bribing people with food?), but this is definitely the first I've heard.  Was actually wondering what would cause a stampede that killed ~50 people.  Granted, I'm connecting my own dots there, but you don't generally get stampedes at a (any?) funeral?"
"Kinda dramatic op, it’s food"
That's incredibly beautiful and I fully agree!
"Not US Airbases, Iraqi bases housing US troops. Small difference, yet important"
They saw they had the support of the democrat party.

"What about collateral damage? Civilian casualties? Unless I’m completely ignorant about the advances in nuclear weaponry I don’t see how dropping nukes, even on military targets, would go over well. "
Highly doubt it goes that far anyway. Let’s wait and see what the real damage is from tonight’s strike..
Didn't want all that discovery leaked.
I hope the settlement is enough for CNN to file bankruptcy.
Sadly it won't and I'd bet and a dollar to a donut confidentiality was agreed upon so we won't know the amount
Fox News has been doing that for three days.
Yup. Don't remind the Left that Obama killed UBL.
Who is UBL?
Usama bin Laden
Who the hell is that?
Sarcasm?
Never heard of Usama bin Laden. I know of a Osama bin Laden
"It’s been spelled both ways in the news, professor. Does that suffice for you?"
Doesn't change my response.  I'll repeat it for you.
"""I've never heard of Usama bin Laden"""

These poor Iranian women fighting against corruption and theft - a stark contrast from the overweight pink haired leftist freaks crying that the us government is fascist.
They are so brave. So brave.
The Iranian women in the picture were though.
Legitimately yes. This is what actual feminism looks like.
"Yes, sir! They didn't spend their time dissing Trump on twitter and wearing pink p*ssy hats. They fought for REAL rights. God speed, brave souls."
That wasn't REAL protesting.
Is overthrowing a government that has killed their citizens in the past worth the lives of a few thousand American boys and girls? Has local American police/government not killed any American citizens in the past?
Actually anti-vaxxers protest and flat-earthers do too. I’m pretty sure there are more than a few republicans there.
I did an analysis of studies of the “Arab spring” which was occurring while I was in college.

White privilege is real. In Egypt.
"So you're telling me the ridiculous number of Asian visitors in Egypt dont get the same protection? And does this apply in Iraq, Sytia, Liberia, or anywhere else that does not get its primary income from tourism?"
"They're protecting their money, not white people."
It was in my second sentence. Of course Asians are offered the same protection. 
I wouldn't have a clue about other countries. Which is why I only mentioned Egypt. 
"And again, I specifically said they are looking to protect their tourism industry. "
You have very poor reading comprehension skills.
How about brown people get  job Nd victimize whites..

Sarcasm comes through inflection. Text does not have inflection.
"Your satire is pathetically lacking, princess."
"Interesting how the comment above your original ""satire"" got a few dozen likes. We conservatives live satire...good satire, that is. "
Yet...nobody upvoted yours. WEIRD! 
"Alternate theory: you were being genuine, and are now defensively trying to save face. After all, if this was good satire, you would have corrected me after my first response. Why wait until I point out the clear logical error? Remember, apparently nobody else picked up on it either."
Sounds like racism to me that brown people pray on white and they needed to stop it
You're a crazy person
I must. Since I dont see white people as the enemy.   It's called taking responsibility for your actions.   I was born in a very poor nieghborhood and made it out and made it big.  I did that and none kept me.down because I'm African American.   Yea it was hard but my Italian wife who also came from the projects of Yonkers also went to school did what she had to do and got her degree and does just fine without me. So both black and white skinned people who started at worse and poor made it out by ourself and now live very comfortable.  Don't blame others just fix yourself..     and Egypt the cops protect the tourist because locals try to rob them constantly. Who wants to go to a shit hole to be robbed instead to enjoying the country's bueaty and that money people bring to your country creates jobs. So don't be selfish and rob them because all you are doin is keeping your family and people in poverty
Instead of white privilege sounds like locals gave lack of morals . Maybe try working instead of robbing
Very interesting bro.
Because the same anti-West sentiment remained. Same thing would happen to Iran if the current Islamic Republic fell.
"While the US hasn't always been great at meddling in other countries the cultural retaliation seems to mess them up for a long time. Most Iranians in 1979 wanted a government that had nothing to do with America. Well, they got it."
Fucking BINGO. Egypt ousted their dictator and immediately elected The Muslim Brotherhood
Is orange man involved? No? Left no care then.
He should troll them by talking about it on twitter or a national address.  Force it to be a talking point — let’s see the left defending the general who ordered this massacre.
He gives his national addresses on twitter.
"What left are you talking about? Democrat retirees who sit on their retirement savings with ""I'm with Her"" bumper stickers on their car who are fine with the status quo except maybe gay people and weed are okay?"
​
Cuz all other lefties are about 1 financial collapse from occupying Wall Street permanently.
Double post your comment again crackhead
"What left are you talking about? Democrat boomers who sit on their retirement savings with ""I'm with Her"" bumper stickers on their car? "
​
Cuz all other lefties are about 1 financial collapse from occupying Wall Street permanently.
"If you stop for two seconds and think about it, this has been true of the majority of people the entirety of the existence of people - one bad crop, one bad fall, one bad anything and it’s game over."
"Things are easier today for the people of the West. Maybe aspire to be more than a mediocre artist or social media expert. Try for jobs that offer more and if you don’t have the skill, develop them. The rest of us are really getting sick of the “give me because I exist” attitude"
"And the rest of us are sick of the ""I made it, fuck everyone else"" attitude. The left wants basic needs met for all people, not luxuries. Get off your high horse and get in touch with your humanity for once in your life, you might become a happier person."
"Give a man to fish... etcetera, etcetera...  "
"If you want to be paid for skilled labor, then acquire a skill. It could be technical, like electrical or mechanic trades, or it could be artistic, like pottery or painting. The trade itself doesn't matter, it is that you are putting your acquired knowledge to work and producing something for society. Be it body or baubles, if you have a marketable skill, you can make money. That is what it means to ""make it"" in America."
"If anyone is on a high horse, it’s you. You think you’re better because you want “basic needs met for all people.” Everyone would <em>like</em> if everyone could have their basic needs met. But I sure as hell don’t want a government deciding what my basic needs are. You shouldn’t want that either. You could be starting charities. Or you could start a company that sells a product, in which the proceeds go to a charity or organization of your choosing. But instead, you want the government to come and babysit you because you don’t want to lend an actual hand in the problems you cry about? And you’re talking about being a humanity-involved person? Riiiiight."

As our generation gets older more and more of it will succeed and have succeeded. And the power you think you have will dwindle...like it is. Reddit is a large echo chamber for Lefties with small chambers for dissenting ideas. Go back to your echo room for you clearly don't want to understand this world any better.
There were marches demonstrating against it here in europe though
"In the USA. The only people talking about the thousands that were killed over in Iran are those that lean slightly to the right all the way to libertarians. The majority of left leaning individuals probably haven't done any research as to why we attacked. They just saw Trump and said ""fuck that guy, if he is for it then im against it!"""
This left's response to this is actually disgusting. I hope everyone can now see what lies beneath their mask.
What did they say
What didn’t they say. Ilhan Omar attacked America again. 
Hollywood snubbed the killing of a dictator who killed protestors as a war crime. 
Others screamed death to America. 
"George Lopez said he would like to take the 80 mil bounty by Iran to Assassinate trump, as a ‘joke’, yet what he really meant was to virtue against Americans and excuse the actions of Iran. "
What more can they say.. they are lost idiots.
How did Ilhan Omar attack America again?? I saw the tweet say Trump should divest from his worldwide businesses that would profit from a war with Iran. Tbh he probably should have divested everything when he got the job. Either way calling that an attack on our nation is slanderous.
Tbh he probably should have divested everything when he got the job.
"IIRC he followed proper procedure that others followed. Nothing less, nothing more."
"You can argue there needs to be more criteria that's met but you can't really do that post-election. But more importantly there's so many loopholes all of these things mean nothing. Obama did something Netflix wanted. Presidency ends, is given a huge contract to produce nothing. For those who are in politics for longer (ie. Biden, Clinton) they just get their family members with high paying jobs where they do nothing. Burisma for Hunter, Expedia and NBC for Chelsea."
It's easy for them to game the system if all you're looking for is direct self-interest.
"It's why while putting family members in government positions isn't great, it's absurd to point at that and go ""See! Self enrichment"" and then ignore the far worse things. A government position will never pay as much as some corporate board spot. Same with influence. While neither of these are great I hate it when it's so obviously 1 sided. ""OMG, Trump has Kushner working for him!"", completely ignores all of the top politicians having inexperienced kids with top board positions in huge corporations. Yup, totally not quid pro quo shit going on there."
Don't forget Michael Moore and Rose McGowan apologized to the Iranian regime (pretending it's on the behalf of the country... as if they speak for others).
Yep that was my hollywood section.
Ah. Figured they should be separate because there's being anti-Trump that you hate that he killed a terrorist and then there's being so anti-Trump you apologize to a murderous regime that upholds 0 human rights because 1 of their top murderers was killed.
In fairness there was a large amount of people (mostly Iranian American citizens) gathered outside of the embassy in New York right after. Still agree with the meme.
"I wish it wasn’t a meme so when
Using as a factual piece its not to be construed as its a meme its not real"
"Now this is what feminism is supposed to look like.  They’re actually fighting for good cause.  SJWs, take notes"
link to names? site? where's this information from?
Someone on the left should start a hashtag movement. I'm sure that will be effective.
Send in Greta
"Good lord, imagine that little brat in Iran. Somehow climate change won’t matter anymore. Her childhood would end there and then."
How dare you ...
I didnt know Travolta was in Iran
Their marches are about how words are violence.
"Every woman depicted(to my knowledge, correct me of wrong) is a hero"
The fifties through the nineties were not 80 years ago champ.
"Those dead women don't have any immediate political utility to many on the left, so of course this is ignored."
May they all rest easy and their attackers burn eternally
The left are pussies. They only carry on in places that they know they're safe.
can i get a link to the names of the victims?
Trump made a good point on Rush today.  Whatever he says /does they do/say the opposite.  He should just run on their agenda.   Not srs but the way he gets them to change positions on the fly is hilarious.
[removed]
Good old John Travolta
Persian women are hot. There I said it.
Love the fact that the empty street is down town Winnipeg.
"American Democrats are more concerned with the latest iPhone release and virtue signaling. They don't give a shit about anything else. Unless it is free stuff, of course."
Feminists only care about white countries. So much for getting rid of racism.
"I'm sorry, we're a bit preoccupied with the 33,000 people that died in 2019 because of lack of healthcare or affordable basic supplies."
"The Iranian government has zero respect for its citizens' lives. Even just now, 30+ people have died at the government-sponsored mourning due to a stampede. That's what happens when you pack thousands into a tight space with zero planning. Clearly, scoring a quick propaganda win was more important to the government than the safety of citizens."
"Oh right, the protestors are anti-Palestine and pro-Israel, chants:"
"”We have no money or fuel, to hell with Palestine.”"
"""No to Gaza, no to Lebanon. We sacrifice our lives for Iran,"""
"Once again the left finds themselves on the wrong side of history as they are pro-Palestine and anti-Israel.  Just like they've always been on the wrong side of history, which is why they are so desperate to rewrite or erase it.  Watch them attempt to claim ""parties have switched"" 30 years from now...lmao."
That many ? That is insane. Don’t think even think Kim Jong- Un kills that many in such a short period.
"My point is that the US hasn't exactly been angelic in her dealings with Iran. I left out the four times since wwII that we tried toppling their govt and the Iran contra affair. You know, when st Ronald Reagan sold weapons to the embargoed Iranian govt to fund and arm the contras, a group responsible for thousands of murders?"
"I don't normally jump into this sub to add anything -you all have the right to circle jerk like any other sub- but the fact that, once again, conservatives are saber rattling for ""freedom"" as a justification for another Middle East adventure is dangerous. "
Y'all don't trust democrats for impeachment because of Clinton...fine. I have the same right to say you all blew any faith on republican war planning and honesty since Bush.
"Edit: i would like to add that this further proves that any nation that does not have nuclear weapons is prey to American power. If you want to go after a nation oppressing their people, actively funding terrorist schools, and had closer connections to 9/11, how about Saudi Arabia? That country that Trump and his son love and helped in their illegal war with Yemen?"
Justifying Iranian terrorism based on things 80 years ago and whataboutery. Typical ayatollah shill
I have the same right to say you all blew any faith on republican war planning and honesty since Bush.
"... apparently majority of Dems also voting for the war doesn't matter. Republicans get all the blame, as usual."
My point is that the US hasn't exactly been angelic in her dealings with Iran.
"And no, it hasn't. But every country that brews a government out of pure anti-US sentiment is never a good government. The US messes up. Some higher ups have nefarious goals, but nonetheless, the outcome is still better than those that want nothing to do with the US. The only thing that united everyone in 1979 against the shah was their hatred of the US. How'd that turn out for them?"
My point is that the US hasn't exactly been angelic in her dealings with Iran.
"Im not sure any of us were making the argument that the US has been. But any idea that Iran is justified in the things thay've been doing since the late 70's because of the US is just wrong. Not saying that's your point, but its a common theme among many. "
"I left out the four times since wwII that we tried toppling their govt and the Iran contra affair. You know, when st Ronald Reagan sold weapons to the embargoed Iranian govt to fund and arm the contras, a group responsible for thousands of murders?"
"Yes, the US and everyone else on the planet have actively engaged in some sort of subversion and political influence of foreign Governments to better fit their own interests. Not saying it's right, but again, not good justification for Iran's actions. Especially those against its own people. "
"And the Iran Contra affair isnt justifiable either, I dont want to seem like im defending it. But lets not take those events out of context and act like it was meant to screw with Iran."
"conservatives are saber rattling for ""freedom"" as a justification for another Middle East adventure is dangerous. "
"This is laughably wrong. No one here wants another ME war, but the majority of us sure as hell dont want to sit back and do nothing when people like Soleimani threaten our forces and lead insurgent groups to hit our embassy. "
Y'all don't trust democrats for impeachment 
"We dont trust the Democrats and their attempt at impeachment because it's politically fueled with a load of horseshit tied in as ""evidence."" The impeachment has nothing to do with the Clintons. "
I have the same right to say you all blew any faith on republican war planning and honesty since Bush.
How the hell is that and impeachment connected? 
i would like to add that this further proves that any nation that does not have nuclear weapons is prey to American power.
"Once again, we arent the only country to dabble in foreign affairs. The ignorant love to act like the worlds biggest problems are caused by the US. "
"If you want to go after a nation oppressing their people, actively funding terrorist schools, and had closer connections to 9/11, how about Saudi Arabia?"
"The vast majority of the people here would agree with this, we'd love to cut ties with SA and hammer them for their garbage too. Sadly, we along with many others dont because they're a strategic resource that allows the west access to all its meddling in the ME. "
That country that Trump and his son love and helped in their illegal war with Yemen?
"You mean the same country every President going back how long has turned a blind eye to and worked with when its come to the ME? The country that's donated millions to the Clintons and other scummy politicians in our country? Yeah, nice try tying the SA issue solely to Trump. Orange man bad, amirite."
"I guess my point is that, while arguments about whether we can stand by as embassies are attacked and how to deal with that is fair, this has nothing to do with the civilians of Iran. Considering that trump has threatened to commit a war crime, has lauded the tyrants of other nations (SA, Russia, NK, China), and done all he can to aggravate this situation, turning this into some 2002, Bush-esque ""gotta bring Democracy"" talking point avoids the point and is disingenuous at best."
"Edit: this isn't just ""Trump bad,"" i hated Obama's blunders in the middle east as much. He was a war criminal like Bush, Clinton, and so many others. Trump failed us by all but destroying all of our soft power options prior to this situation."
Trump failed us by all but destroying all of our soft power options prior to this situation.
He responded to an attack on an embassy with what you'd expect. It's a fucking embassy and you're not at war... that's egregiously against international political standards.
"Bet if he did nothing and then they attacked another embassy, another US ship, maybe another internationally flagged ship people would then bitch he is being inactive. But then maybe Soleimani is in Iran during all of that so he can't target him. But Iraq? He has authority for military action there and he took the shot."
"Heard these same stupid arguments with bin Laden. ""OMG, they're now going to be angrier and launch more attacks in retaliation"".... they already hate us and want to kill us and the only thing stopping them is they know they'd die if they tried conventional warfare. Sorry if I'm not going to pretend like this wasn't a great opportunity to take."
and done all he can to aggravate this situation
"Utter bullshit. Iran has been causing shit in the region for 20 years and it's escalated pretty bad in recent years. They attacked a US ship and took Americans hostage, they attacked an international trade ship, and they organized an attack on a US embassy.... the hell is ""aggrevating the situation"" when they want to kill you and make what small attempts they can to do it (all while trying to keep self-preservation going --- which is why people are overblowing this whole thing)."
"stop making sense, it hurts my curated vision of geopolitics that I took time refining within this echo chamber. /s"
Except they don't make any sense. The only thing that has stopped Iran from being more aggressive and going to direct war is self-preservation. Has this drone strike removed that factor for Iran??? NO!!!
So there is no difference to the situation we were in pre drone strike except 2 key terrorists dead.
Bunch of people talking international politics and military escalation with 0 knowledge of either aspect.
They are so beautiful ...
Misogynist religious death cults piss me off.
"Good thing we killed their top general. That pretty much United the country against us, again."
"Don't worry, the typical actors will, and probably already have, find a way to twist this into Islamophobia."
"Iran is a horrible place, their revolution in the 80’s had so many negative effects especially on women’s rights. Americans don’t talk about it enough."
Why are all of these Iranian women more attractive than the average female leftist?
Iran kills all these people and the American media doesn't bat an eye.  
I suggest that we should have bombed Soleimani's funeral because it was full of people calling for the death of all of America and I get banned from Twitter.
bombing a funeral
"Pretty easy way to justify any claim that America is a warmongering terror state. I mean come on man, you have to know how genuinely stupid and dark that idea is."
"Dark, stupid, would be illegal, but also tactical,"
"There is no tactical value in attacking a man’s funeral. You just look like a monster. Why? Because if you can’t show even an ounce of humanity, you are one."
I don’t fight wars to show off my humanity.  I fight to win.  Massive amounts of enemies congregating in a single location is 100% tactical.
"If you can’t win the propaganda war, you can’t win the rest of it. The collateral of civilians at that funeral would be spun like you refuse to think about, and is just unacceptable overall. You start scorching towns and social events where noncombatants will be present, people will tend to stop supporting your war."
Source: The Vietnam War
Uh yeah but we actually won the Vietnam war.  The Vietcong has expended their entire force and all we had to do was march north instead of onto our boats to go home.  That was just a lack of political fortitude to finish the job.
As someone who has spent many many many years in Iraq and Afghanistan- let me just tell you we haven’t been fighting wars there.  We’ve been playing political games of stupidity.  If you want to win a war you do it at any cost full stop.  You don’t hold back and say “okay guys we are not allowed to fire on anyone who doesn’t fire at us first” bullshit ROE.
"If you want to do the job then do it, and if you don’t then don’t.  Either way you never half ass war."
Yes that full withdrawl from Vietnam allowing the country to fall to the NVA is clearly winning the war.
"You can strike first all you want, but you’re too short sighted to see how that bites the rest of us in the ass. We shouldn’t even be in that sandbox, but we keep fucking around over there because Bush tossed us into that mess."
"We should have hit Bin Laden, then got out of Afghanistan. We should have just left Iraq alone. Now we’re stuck in wars we can never win because of how they’re fought."
"But the point stands. You lose the propaganda front, you lose the war. Plain and simple."
"I agree that we shouldn’t have come here, but we are here and that’s the reality I deal in not some hypothetical what if we never liberated kuwait fiction.  We also shouldn’t be in Afghanistan either.  But we are.  So while it can be fun to talk about what we should or should not have done - it’s only worth talking about how we move forward from where we are.  And where we are is on the verge of another war with an enemy that has hated us their entire lives and seeks nuclear weapons and are Muslim hard liners who believe allah will return when they murder all the Jews.  So, if your expert military analysis suggests we should sit on ass, I might think that probably isn’t the best idea I’ve personally ever heard.  Had congress had the balls to say “this is war and we will fight all opposition without prejudice” in Iraq or Afghanistan then the world would be different and people would be scared shitless of the us forces.  Instead we’re basically playing target practice - as the targets - for no reason that I can fathom."
And we did win Vietnam.  Vietnam itself views the war as a defeat - you ever been there?  I have.  Also in 1975 Vietnamese General Giap said the same thing - so you don’t have to take my word for it.  Vietnam was over and the Vietcong were completely expended from their Tet Offensive failures- this is historical fact and the North was on the verge of total surrender at that point but the anti war gang back home put on the pressure and we left.  The Tet Offensive was a major win for the USA.
Yes that full withdrawl from Vietnam allowing the country to fall to the NVA is clearly winning the war.
"Well I imagine they meant military-wise. After the Tet Offensive the Vietcong were done. Public opinion is what caused the US to lose the war, not military operations. Which makes your point correct. Even in the past war wasn't just about military operations but about PR and that's even more-so the case in modern times."
The Vietcong has expended their entire force and all we had to do was march north instead of onto our boats to go home. That was just a lack of political fortitude to finish the job.
"Right, because public opinion was against it. You're right though, after the Tet Offensive the Vietcong were done. But like the person above has said, war also has a PR element now in modern times and you're not considering it."
“All we had to do was ...”
"Yeah, but you didn’t did you?"
“Lack of political fortitude”
That’s on the US. Inept political leadership is a common reason for nations losing wars. It doesn’t mean the nation didn’t lose the war. 
"The US did not achieve its objectives in Vietnam, while the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese did, plain and simple. "
"1) Casualty figures are not the primary determining factor in determining who won a conflict, if they were the Germans would be the winner of WW2."
2) the US casualty figures in Vietnam are not even that impressive. The US and South Vietnam had a positive casualty ratio against enemy forces of about 1 to 3. Not all that impressive considering the massive technological advantage they had with near air superiority.
"COULD the US have won? Yes, absolutely. However it’s home front is historically weak, and is going to be even weaker in the coming conflict. War is not just about the battlefield. If your home base is mentally weak, then that is a deficiency in the nation participating in the war."
"US has now had 3 very bad presidents in a row in terms of foreign policy, that would be W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. The 3 of these men have done enormous damage to the US global position and standing with their oscillating policy. HW Bush and Clinton were generally competent leaders with strategic vision."
Trump is on the verge of the biggest debacle which will inevitably lead to the expulsion of US troops from the Middle East once and for all.
/yawn
Gotcha 😘
Irrelevant. Not my country not my war. We shouldn't be over there in the first place. You guys call yourselves conservative while liberally applying the US military to the middle east like ointment to your hemorrhoids.
"Conservatism = / = isolationism, but alright."
Conservatism = wanting less centralized government power and things that go with it like lower tax rates for everyone
"Funneling a gigantic ass military budget = giving the government absolute power and things that go along with it, like stupidly high tax rates."
Is this supposed to be a defense of the Iranian generals assassination? Or is this just supposed to call out hypocrisy?
They're blind to their hypocrisy.
Where is the right's March? I'm conservative and feel for these people but where are you? Terrible message to send and cheap political points trying to be made on real women. Sickening. Be better
Where is the right's March? I'm conservative and feel for these people but where are you? Terrible message to send and cheap political points trying to be made on real women. Sickening. Be better
"The Women's March is an entirely left-wing protest now, as evident by them not wanting any notable right wingers marching with them or even people with political apparel (like a MAGA hat). That's what people are pointing to. They love to protest about problems here but aren't even willing to make statements online, let alone in person, about terrible regimes like Iran's or China's."
"That's because CNN and MSNBC aren't reporting on it. Nonetheless, this is distasteful and we should lead by example. Cheap political points made exploiting the deaths of 700 women. If we as convervatives support that then I'm out. I don't give a damn what political party is or isn't doing something. Real people are dying, WOMEN!! Yet this post is trying to dunk on Democrats? Be better. That is all"
"There doesnt need to be a march at all. The point here is to illustrate that the Left loves to march against ""inequality"" here at home while ignoring actual inequality abroad. It's about what fits the narrative."
"I agree, it’s unfortunate that today is only about full scale war between the parties."
LIKE ANY OF YOU GIVE A SHIT ABOUT WOMENS RIGHTS. FOH.
Please explain what a scene from Pulp Fiction has anything to do with Iran other than the Royale with cheese?
"Yo just because we don’t want to go into another pointless war doesn’t mean that we dont care about those people. We want to strive to better all nations through diplomacy and economic stability, rather than political assassinations and puppet dictators, because that has worked *so well *in the past"
We want to strive to better all nations through diplomacy and economic stability
That's not a potential measure when they hate you.
"Though you're right, the US should've never assassinated the Iranian Prime Minister in the 50s. But likewise, the Iranians should not have thrown out the shah. The White Revolution was a success and it took just 2 years of a recession for them to remove his progress and burn it down to the ground with the Islamic Republic."
"Where are the names of the civilian passengers of Iran air flight 655 we shot down in 88? You know, the one over Iranian waters that killed over 200 people?"
Hi!
Did we pay restitution to the victims of that?
"We did, i respond below."
"Edit: did we give iran a chance to pay reparations, or did we just retaliate? I am actually asking."
Reparations for what? Attacking a fucking embassy on purpose? 
"Are you stupid mate? 
The plane was an accident, hence the apology. "
How do you accidentally organise a mob to attack an embassy? Or how do you accidentally order an Iranian force lead by Soleimani to gun down 1500 protestors.
There is a difference.
"Point taken by the embassy. However, it is odd that this conservative wet dream is suddenly a priority, just as more damming evidence against trump comes out."
"There are nations all over the world, Saudi Arabia included, where people are oppressed. However, now we have to meddle in this particular affair. We have been toppling govts all over for decades, we've done so or attemped to do so four times with Iran since WWII. Saudi Arabia sits as a friend despite all of her sins, Trump says he ""loves"" Kim jong un, and regularly sides with Putin. Spare me the virtue signalling of ""but the protesters.""  I am leery of this justification as it smacks of Bush all over again. The Iranian govt exists because of aggravating us foreign policy and was armed by Reagan."
"This has nothing to do with protesters. It has everything to do with distraction, funding the military industrial complex, and keeping the poor around the world at war. Has iran transgressed? Certainly. However, Trump has not helped by being publicly antagonistic to them, his response was absolutely provocative, and our past actions are less than impressive. "
"My point is with the plane is that, before we throw stones and start another mid east adventure, let us remember that America has committed actions and crimes that would, by her own standards, make us terrorists, oppressors, or war criminals."
You deconstruct everything good and bad.
"You don’t realise your own hypocrisy. You say usa should be Iran’s friend who attacks embassies and in the same breath say USA shouldn’t tolerate Saudi Arabia because they are also bad, yet they accommodate the USA... and have caused no grievance to the USA."
Which fucking is it? 
You see every situation and see only the bad. Never the positive. 
You are engaging in postmodern deconstructionist thinking. But such thinking has no logic. With this logic the plumber to the doctor is just leeching off society for self interest. Because they get paid to do a job. You never see the actual value of the service provided. 
If Saudi Arabia is oppressive to its citizens... but chose to get along with the USA.. you say USA should suddenly intervene. And that’s your ‘double standard’. 
"I know your leftist logic. And it’s devoid of sense. Again you are what the great philosophers have warned about with regards to deconstructionism. Every action taken has a ‘bad’ and you focus on that. With your logic nothing would ever happen. The world would become nihilistic. And in nihilism there is chaos, for not doing anything with a purpose leads to disorder, anarchy, starvation death and war. Oh the irony."
"Btw, i enjoy the debate. It's too bad that it's over something so dire and imminent. Thanks for engaging."
Did you see the point I made? 
"I’m not just dabbling on. This is a very real thing happening with the postmodern mindset.
It’s all about a mindset of critique. "
"The left ties ones hands and critisizes everything to the point of inaction, until the world burns by men of action with less moral integrity. "
The distinguishing factor with Saudi Arabia although I’m vehemently not a fan... is that they are willing to co-operate and live peacefully with the west. Is it also an irony that places like Dubai are so rich that citizens often don’t even have to work and get paid large sums just for being citizens? Is that the oil the USA stole? The same oil that has made the actual citizens of those countries super rich? Without the endless wars? 
"Iran litterally destroyed a progressive profitable monarchy set by the U.K. and USA under the Persian bloodline. Created the Islamic revolution.. and killed and threatened not only it’s own citizens but wanted to extend their power, and influence across the Middle East for Jihad. I’m sorry but this is a big difference. "
The humanitarian in me says all people should be free and not under Islamic control. The reality within me says just accept their way of life and let them be if they don’t bother free nations.
Iran has been stirring the pot: they are jihadists. They are dangerous. 
I suggest you read about Ismael Rushdie and the satanic verses affair if you want to find out about what Iranian supreme leader is capable of and what they actually did to U.K. famous author because he published something they didn’t like in a western country.
"I understand. I guess i see this sudden call for a new conflict as being both a distraction and eerily similar to 2002. It sounds like you and I (a dirty leftist) are agreed that this whole situation is not ideal. But turning the issue from foreign real politic to ""gosh , we need to help the Iranian people"" is obscuring the point. Trump does not care what happens to the Iranian people, he made that clear issuing his willingness to commit a war crime."
"I, like most leftists, hate the radical regime controlling Iran, but the motives for war in this case, i feel, are not as innocent as this meme implies and, frankly but with no offense intended, I'll be damned if we are led into another mid east conflict by false appeals to ""gotta bring Democracy."" There could have been better diplomatic ways of dealing with Iran and, i feel, Trump squandered them. Iran is a huge country with difficult terrain, the people are numerous and ruled by zealots who WELCOME the apocalypse (which is why pence scares me lol). This may be for America what the Sicilian expedition was for athens."
The USA and west always creates options whereby nations they engage with have a route to help themselves through a peace settlement. 
The USA and the west is happy to let Iran do as it likes as long as they don’t attack the west. Or become a nuclear power. 
I repeat a Jihadi nation can not have access to nuclear arsenals. It’s not about fairness. It’s about aberting a damn apocalypse or being bullied by a jihadi nation. 
"It’s amazing you think right wingers are willing the apocalypse and yet you fail to see the danger of Iran gaining nuclear arms. And if you think Obama’s deal stopped them think again. Israel has provided ample evidence that they were working towards nuclear projects and uranium enrichment. Hate on Israel all you want as leftists do, whilst calling them ironically nazis. But the Obama nuclear deal was a fake precept to enrich Iran and ignore the truth of what was happening."
just as more damming evidence against trump comes out.
"What evidence? Evidence of what?? ""More"" evidence means there was any to begin with. Keep hearing this nonsense with ""sources say"" in every news article or obvious partisans taking cheap shots exaggerating everything on news networks. Are you talking about the impeachment shit??? Have you noticed they brought the charges down from bribery and quid pro quo to essentially ""you defended yourself against our accusations""... oh no!!! Also, telling your staff not to attend informal requests isn't obstructing justice... they're not subpoenas! And for the subpoenas that were issued it's also not illegal for him to challenge them in court and only have people attend after the courts have decided....god this whole thing is such a fucking joke."
"However, Trump has not helped by being publicly antagonistic to them, his response was absolutely provocative"
"And what escalation will Iran take??? They fund Hezbollah, they ruin countries around them, they attack US ships and embassies.... other than declaring war there is nowhere for them to escalate you fool!!! And unless you think they've all of a sudden become stupid and forgotten self-preservation, the very thing that they've keep going in the last 40 years, they will NOT declare war against the US."
The US apologized for that and payed reparations to the families and to Iran. In total it was over 130 million dollars. So get out of here with that bs.
"By your own admission, this has nothing to do with protesters, but that we don't get along. If you want to debate the issue on its own merrits, fine. But the appeal to emotion you all are using in this thread to turn it into ""the us must champion the rights of the oppressed iranians"" is insane."
"That's ultimately my point. The Iranian theocracy is a tyrannical government based upon the worst and most apocalyptic views of its religion (much like why i dislike evangelicals). It would be better if it were gone. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE PROTESTERS AND SAYING SO IS INCREDIBLY DISINGENUOUS. All previous actions and inactions by Trump scream this fact. Do not distort the point of the conflict when so much is on the line. The problem is that Trump has done all he can to antagonize them, alienate all of our allies (including in Iraq) and left us with a situation where we ONLY have hard power left to deal with this. "
"Had he not torn up the nuclear agreement, he could have held it hostage. Had he not insulted NATO repeatedly, they might stand more behind us. Had he not betrayed the kurds, they may have joined us. Now, because of his previous blunders, he has left us in a lurch. Turning this into a 2002 ""we gotta bring Democracy"" talking point is foolish at best, deceptive at worst."
"Had he not torn up the nuclear agreement, he could have held it hostage."
There's a reason the Obama administration had it passed through a different channel than the usual international relations method. Because it was trash. It had 0 worthwhile contingencies in making sure Iran not only held up its side of the bargain but continued after the deal had expired. Same thing with the Paris Climate Agreement and its measures with China. Total rubbish.
Also economic prosperity in Iran will NOT change the hatred of the US the regime has. It'll only strengthen the regime as most of the money is funneled to guess where?
"Iran was prosperous under the shah. He increased every basic quality of life standard through the years of the White Revolution. 2 years of economic stagnation and a bitter hatred of the US and they threw all that progress away for misery.... but hey, the Islamic Republic is anti-US still so many are still a-okay with them."
"I too have brain damage, I will fit in with other Hollywood people, although I'd rather avoid the pedophile stuff"
"The meaning of ""Porker"" has really changed over the years. She does have horse teeth."
Maybe it is an Animal Farm reference? 
But not fair to make fun of her teeth...or how amazingly ignorant she is..or how she slide into the entitlement mentality 20 min after getting into office... 
But yea.. big teeth
Why did she keep a towel on her head
Because she has no self respect.
Modern feminism has gone full circle
So she doesn't get beaten and raped.
"The pandering to terrorist - associated individuals and groups by US media is appalling. Not to mention simply, stupid."
I'm actually concerned now that the irananians have found sympathizers in this whole event and will use that to get intelligence/commit crimes/terrorist acts through them just to make trump look bad. 
"I seriously could see those fucks blowing up an airplane full of citizens because they want to show ""look Iran can get to us"". "
Don't forget this is all because they hate Donald Trump.
What did his mom say?  I know my son and he is a good person. 
"Yeah, how can she say that with a straight face?"
Well he also used his dead brother's wife so this is pretty par for the course for him really...
Nobody ever said that this happened.
Joke didn't land I suppose....
Trump hates the LGBQT community so much that he nominated a gay man to the Appeals Court.
"All 53 Republicans voted for Bumatay, but <strong>no Democrat voted for him.</strong>"
……….<em>LOL!</em>
I say we call everyone that did not vote for him a homophobe. They have been calling conservatives sexist and racist and homophobic for a lot less.
I say we call everyone that did not vote for him a homophobe.
"Sure.  If the roles were reversed, and you had the Republicans all voting ""No"" on a gay Judge, we wouldn't hear the end of in on the News for <em>months.</em>  ""Republicans won't vote for Gay judge due to their own homophobic concerns,"" and you wouldn't be able to convince them otherwise."
I'm laughing just imagining it.
"Guess what happened when I posted this article to <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>? Actually, you probably don't need to guess."
Petty as shit
"The committee reported Bumatay’s nomination to the full Senate, and the Senate voted to confirm him 53-40 on Dec. 10. All 53 Republicans voted for Bumatay, but no Democrat voted for him. (Seven Democrats did not vote on the nomination.)"
"Worth noting, The 9th Circuit has 29 active judge-ships and Bumatay is Trump's 10th conservative appointment. Moving the ""right"" direction."
Hahahaha their heads must be spinning!
"Such irony and transparency, the left always claims Trump is a racist and hates gays then Trump appoints a gay."
"If you can't recognize that a homosexual person of color nominated by Trump is a homophobic white supremacist, I don't know if we live in the same reality."
"Yup, we totally screwed up our relationship with Iran.  Things are <em>so</em> different now!"
"Aw, man!  And we were just getting over the hostage crisis!"
"Thanks, Trump, for destroying a good thing!"
"The only real ally the us has had is Israel lol all the others are just plain hateful and mostly uncivilized country, other wise these four things would be closer to west standards, treatment of women, gays not geting hurt or killed for sexual orientation, terrorist groups in the middle east would be wiped out and destroyed quickly by the armies, people that are not Islam or left Islam would see punishments. These four issues along with there many sub problems are the things middle east refuses to adapt to, for those that have in there daily lifes I say good on you."
And most Democrats would have us turn our backs on Israel in favor of Palestine.
"These are people who hate freedom and chant death to America no matter what we do. They hate what we stand for, and nothing will change that."
We will never be allies. Any amount of favorable agreement we can make with them only puts of the inevitable.
"The best way to deal with them is just the way we are. We stand out ground. We defend what we built in Iraq, take a stance in favor of Israel, and we set the terms."
We can't continue to prop them up. Doing so only strengthens them making them a more formidable foe when and if we ever have to combat them.
"Come to think of it, we are on opposite sides of most of the middle East, Russia, and China, yet our global trade agreements have been more favorable for those nations than our own. "
"As an expert in these matters, as I've played Civilization, I feel this has been a mistake.. given the amount of resources our trade has provided them for military use. It's good that the US has put a lot of the tech tree into military."
"These are people who hate freedom and chant death to America no matter what we do. They hate what we stand for, and nothing will change that."
"I read a declaration in a terrorist magazine that said (paraphrased) ""Yes, we hate you for everything you've done to us, but let's be clear: we'd hate you even if you had done nothing, we hate you because of your western way of life and we won't stop until you are subjugated."""
"I knew this already of course, but it helps to have it in writing (if I can ever find it again)"
"These are people who hate freedom and chant death to America no matter what we do. They hate what we stand for, and nothing will change that."
Fucking Democrats. I hear that Iran doesn't like us much either.
Americans sending billions to Iran that was hence used to fund terrorist groups was a huge mistake (at least I hope it was not by design.)
"We are now becoming energy independent. I would push for us just abandoning the region except for forces to protect Israel if it wasn't for Iran potentially developing nuclear weapons. How do you handle a country trying to get nukes that chants ""death to America?"" Can we stop them indefinitely or is a world where a country that reveres martyrs can explode the world inevitable? How does mutually assured destruction act as a deterrent to those who believe you go to heaven if you die while killing your enemies?"
The best thing we could do for our national security is to become 100% energy independent. Americans can  produce enough energy if we actually tried.
"Nuclear energy, a push for electric cars, and a change in how American oil goes I to the market as well as an increase in oil production."
"I’d go nuclear, too. I mean, it logically benefits both sides. For “liberals,” it’s cleaner than oil and natural gas. For us, it’s great for the market and it’s cheap once mass-produced. It also would open up a lot of high paying jobs."
It's something both liberals and conservatives agree with. Voters want nuclear. Politicians don't.
"The UAE is solid. They have a dictator in Khalifa, but he represses people from throwing gays off buildings. His stance is his country isn't ready for democracy because everyone will vote to kill the infidels."
"That sounds sadly funny, or funnily sad."
What relationship?!? Just cause Obama gave a terrorist state 100s of Billions of dollars doesn’t mean we ever had a “relationship” with them! Me and 7 others were hit by roadside bombs that general helped to manufacture. Get real!! Obama’s purpose was never to put American’s interests first. You should study the facts before you make silly statements like that!
Did you miss the joke this hard or am I being punked
All it took is the treasury department delivering millions of dollars in cash to the mullahs at the behest of Barack Hussein Obama. How dare Drumpf destroy that!
"We have been doing this for like 40 years. People think WW3 is happening, it’s same thing as North Korea. They do something and we do something, and everyone talks about it for like a month. Then it is forgotten, and the cycle continues. Just my thoughts on this."
"""Death to America"" actually is just anti-Trump - MSM on behalf of Iran"
"""I'm gonna kick your butt"" actually means that he wants to be your friend and maybe play some sports with you on weekends - Mrs. Puff on behalf of Flats"
Correct. All the times they said that before late 2016 was directed to the future... Obviously.
"The issue is that it's not Trump per se, but it has been happening FAR longer. Personally witnessed the masked ""Iranian Students Association"" "
"I remember the protests at Hovde Hall blocking the circle and the chant ""Death to the Shah and U.S. Imperialists."" Yes, I'm old, college is the 1970's for me."
"I see. So they are still thinking like children. ""If he pulls my hair it means he likes me""."
“I’m going to kick your butt!” — Mrs. Puff to SpongeBob at the end of the episode
"""see, we told you Iran would retaliate"""
“The American government are no different than the terrorists they criticize.”
"Lol here in Israel nobody's even excited about this, nobody's freaking out... Everyone are just like ""meh"" we're pretty used to death threats from Iran"
I suspect that it won't be long before we start implementing the same security measures in the US that you guys have been using for years.
Spit ting the same bullshit for 40 years
"Yup.  Fundamentalist Muslim hatred of America and Israel is like a gas which expands to fill any container.  The theocratic Iranian regime was founded on such hatred, and has never once altered or diluted that worldview."
Not much is dumber--or more disingenuous--than leftist claims that we've stirred up Iran.  That's like a battered spouse mired in the cycle of violence blaming herself for whatever excuse the bastard chose the last time through.
"Despots need a boogeyman to focus the hate of the people while they live like kings. Otherwise the people realize their lives are shit and may turn on country ""leadership."""
We even have this in the US where charlatans like Jesse Jackson have amassed power and wealth on the backs of the people who are conditioned to hate whites.

"Wait, I don’t remember any libtard whiny bullshit when Obama INVADED A FRIENDLY NATION to off osama ...."
I thought we were talking about salami. Hes been sponsoring anti america militias for decades.
They got what they deserved. America spanked a tantruming child. End of story.
"As and Iranian/canadian it's becoming so painful to look at Reddit's front page. <a href=""/r/Worldnews"">r/Worldnews</a> and <a href=""/r/news"">r/news</a> all for full of propaganda. I haven't look at the cancer subreddit <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> in years but I'm sure it's same there too."
"Yesterday's top post on worldnews was how Hezbollah said they are not going to target civilians, and redditors were saying look, trump is worse than Hezbollah. "
Holy. Shit. Liberals in the west have completely lost their minds. I just heard on CBC Radio how Iranians are angry that Soleimani was killed. Hmm. Wanna mention how khamenei (soleimani's boss and dear friend) killed 1500+ protestors in iran just a month ago?

I've never seen anything like this. I'm very anti-war and I've seen plenty of grumbling about congressional authorization over my years.
But I've never before seen people actually praising a butcher like this guy.

"I have.  Some years ago I saw a leftist (and shock of shocks, a frothing anti-Semite) post a meme on FB about how great life in Qaddafi's Libya was.  I'm sympathetic to the idea that taking Qaddafi out was a strategic blunder, but the man was a monster."
"Right, it can be both things at the same time."
It's Reddit.  I wouldn't read too much into what makes the front page.  There's not going to be too much world-shaping policy come out of here.  Enjoy it for what it is.
"Not just on reddit. In the press, as well, from all over the place."
"With the press, especially the MSM, it's their 4AM memo. Have to craft that narrative! I'm just surprised people are this enthusiastic about supporting a savage like this guy. Its one thing to say that assassinating him was wrong, it's another to lionize him."
"They're not supporting that guy...they're just NOT supporting Trump.   If Trump cured cancer these people would be saying ""cancer is their right."""
They're not supporting that guy...they're just NOT supporting Trump. 
"<a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1213602414969835521"">Erm.</a>"
"When I say ""they"" I mean the vast majority of Americans and media.  Not LA peeps. 
Edit: To clear up that murky comment I just made....the cast majority of folks are not supporting a terrorist and are glad he's dead.  There ARE, however, a deceptively small group of people, like that pic that would not support Trump, regardless of what he did, like cure cancer.   The fact that they are shown on TV and media outlets should <em>not</em> suggest that's how the majority of America is viewing this."
Stop stop!! You’re posting facts and that’s not allowed.
Reddit superadmins are deleting facts
"The left will go against anything that Trump does however correct the course of action was.  Pelosi wants to limit Trump’s control over the Iran crisis. But when the left has more control over military actions they won’t do anything at all.  I try to be moderate and I try to reach a compromise during a debate but, the Democrats have been pushed so far to the left that me attempting to be moderate makes me an alt righter."
"Had the same experience as a Venezuelan watching people support Maduro and spew propaganda on <a href=""/r/worldnews"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/worldnews</a>"
Its not like Iran has hated America for decades or anything...
"I'm not too familiar with our history there, do they have any reason to hate us other than ""Murica""?"
"Aside from overthrowing their government, general middle East fuckery starting in the cold war, and throwing out a nuclear deal that the whole world agreed on, not too much."
The whole world didn't agree on that nuclear deal.
Iran didn't.
They started violating it from the beginning!
"<a href=""https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14910/iran-nuclear-deal-violations"">https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14910/iran-nuclear-deal-violations</a>"
"You know what, I'll just take the loss there. Iran has definitely had compliance issues and skirted the rules, even before the benefits to the deal were taken away."
So just overthrowing a government and 70 years of war then.
Didnt we shoot down one of their civilian flights in their airspace in the 80s?
&gt; Aside from overthrowing their government 
multiple times... which led Iran into turmoil rampant with religous extremism.
Because the US hasn't stopped fucking with Iran for almost seventy years.
I’ve never seen Reddit this bad before.  I’ve been on an off this website for 8 years.  But the front page actively supporting Iran because they hate Trump?  It’s incredible.
I’m genuinely impressed with these people.
Let's see Iran show off how big and bad they are.
Attack American interests directly. With your own army. No using proxies.
"Come on Iran, let's see how you fight for Allah."
Show the world your not the Persian Pussy brigade
"""We started a war with them!"""
"We have the same relationship we've had with them for decades. They aren't planning on doing anything they weren't planning to do before Soleimani. They are just now using it as an excuse to justify it and trying to turn people against our government, including ourselves."
I hope America does not go to war. Smells alot like the past ones.
"Everyone knows that Americans don't have the appetite for a war and the Iranians don't have the resources for a war.  Hence, no war."
"Americans don't need the appetite, just those in power."
"Iran has been committing acts of war against the US via proxies intermittently for awhile now.  That's sure to continue.  They probably already have something planned, and if they pull it off it will be painted by the media as a response to Trump's action.  "
"Having said that, I doubt it will truly escalate but if it did it would not be a long affair.  Trump isn't going to do Gulf War 3.  That's not his style.  At most, he'll blow up every floating thing in the Persian Gulf owned by Iran and he'll fire missiles at every identified military asset in Iran non-stop until there are no targets left to warrant the cost of the missile, and that'll be that."
If you think the Syria/Iran issues smell fishy you'd be right.

"if this smells like past world conflicts to you, you need to get your nose checked out. Iran is shit. neither the world nor their citizens back their gov or their actions. "
this was a warranted response. don't let the fear mongers sway you. Iran's government is garbage. a full scale liberation is in order. So i really hope a singular strike doesn't bother you that much
Their outrage might mean something if they didn't swear vengeance every time someone looked at them funny.
"I think it's funny how the democrats defend Iran which is a country that beheads and murders gays, transgenders, etc."
"Fun fact, Tehran is actually one of the sex-change capitals of the world."
Isn't it because they'd rather men be trans than gay?
That's my understanding.
What? You have a source for that?
"As of 2008, Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except Thailand. The government provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance, and a sex change is recognized on the birth certificate.  "
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_Iran"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_Iran</a>"
They sanction funds for sex reassignment surgery in order to fit all of their citizens into the category of either male or female without any grey area for those who are homosexual or transgender. Those who get these surgeries performed are subject to social stigma from their families and communities.
"It surely is a mess there, I read so many confusing things right now."
I’m assuming it’s because it’s a poorer country there’s very loose health and safety laws
"You know what I find odd is how Iran is saying stuff like ""Oh we dont hate you America only trump"" and then everyone is like ""Oh i see Iran thats ok if we get rid of him we can still be friends"""
W T F. They are literally using a divide and conquer strat and the morons on social media are eating it up. Like do they think anyone who hates trump cant be a bad guy?
"Democrat or republican, Iran aint your friend."
"Like shit, if Trump was the reason youd think Iran would have been besties prior to him taking office."
Of course they hate Trump. He won't bow and won't send pallets of cash. What nerve...
"Honestly I don't think what Trump did was a good idea but the left wingers are really killing me on this one. They were fine and completely silent as Obama bulldozed Yemen, Libya, Syria, etc and they didn't let out a single peep as he destabilized the region and funded/armed terrorist proxies."
"But now that Trump continues this work, suddenly they're all anti war activists who just realized how bad it is. Like come on, Trump's handling of this has been shit but he inherited the situation from Obama and Bush and their gaggle of mistakes."
Anti war activists huh?  Despite criticizing Trump for wanting to pull out of Syria.  Guess they want it both ways.
"They're fine with war as long as its their party doing it, sadly.."
I had a lot of conservative friends who supported Trump on the basis that they opposed the war mongering under Obama.. and now they've 180'd to defending Trump's actions in Syria and Iraq.
Its all so tiresome..
"A post from an actual right wing sub on popular? Huh, neat"
The situation with Iran is like a clip of a cop slamming down a perp but not the perp slapping the cop first.
"Iran sponsors terrorist groups to kill innocent civilians and they're religiously intolerant. They want to sponsor jihad worldwide and prevent anyone who thinks differently from practicing their religion freely. The MSM needs to stop talking about them as if they are a democratic and free nation. They are a dictatorial, terroristic, Orwellian, theocracy."
Apparently Iran was the only country on the planet to suffer from the CIA during the cold war. 
"At what point do you drop the victim act, and realize that most of your current problems are self-inflicted by your own backwards ideology? "
"Presumably never, as the mullahs want to hold onto power and the US/Israel is a useful tool to rally the sect."
Perfect!
Yet the media sides with terror
I think part of big part of what pisses me off here is that Trump was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.
"If he hadn't acted, Soleimani would have carried out the attack he was planning and probably caused quite a bit of damage. I assure you it would have leaked that Trump had the chance to take him out and didn't. Democrats and the media would be screaming about Trump not acting when he should have because he wanted whatever damage that happened to happen so that he'd have an excuse to go to war/declare martial law/cancel the elections/whatever nonsense they want to accuse him of. They'd be calling for investigations about what Trump knew and when he knew it."
You just can't win with these people if you have an R next to your name.
"After the embassy was attacked they were trying to turn it into ""Trump's Benghazi"""
What attack was Soleimani planning?
"You act like it's a stretch to believe that the man who was basically Iran's Minister of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force"">Terrorism, Destabilization, and Covert Action</a> was in Iraq to carry out the type of activities he's been responsible for orchestrating for the past 22 years. "
"<a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/soleimani-anti-imperialist-hero-200105211451136.html"">The man wasn't a hero by any stretch of the imagination.</a>"
Soleimani wasn't in Iraq for a vacation. He was there because he was coordinating the type of activities he has long coordinated and the Iranian government thought no one would touch him. 
"You know full well that, had he carried out a major attack that led to harm to our human assets in the region, you would be calling for Trump's head for not doing more to stop it."
"Of course Soleimani was in Iraq coordinating violent acts. That's what Generals do. If we had a clue about anything more specific we would have sabotaged the plan. Now the new appointed Commander of the  Quds Force can carry out those same ""plans."" Problem solved?"
Wait ... attacks on us?  You think that's what Iranian Generals do?
I guess that we were right to kill him then.
"I find it very curious that this guy has <em>this</em> strong a vested interest in supporting Iran at all costs, to the point where these kinds of double standards are not only acceptable but laudatory."
"Look at his posting history. It goes back to 2016 but, don't worry, it's not long."
I've seen a lot if Iran apologists on reddit through this whole thing.  IIRC Iran has social media involvement when things like this happen.
Of course Soleimani was in Iraq coordinating violent acts. That's what Generals do.
"So your argument is that it's acceptable for Soleimani to carry out violent actions against Americans (acts of war, in fact) but not acceptable for Americans to carry out a violent action against Soleimani in retaliation? "
Wow.
That's not at all my argument. I'm curious as to why killing a powerful public official is at all proportionate to storming an embassy.
That's not at all my argument.
"No, I'm sure that's not the argument you intended to make but it is the direct implication of what you said. If you don't like it, you should have picked your argument more carefully."
I'm curious as to why killing a powerful public official is at all proportionate to storming an embassy.
It's not proportionate. That was the point.
"Trump drew a red line. He told Iran that he wasn't going to fire back for all the antics they've pulled, but if they ever hurt an American citizen there would be hell to pay. Iranian-proxies (who certainly were directed by Soleimani) <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/04/politics/american-contractor-trump-iran-strike/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">killed a US Contractor in one of their rocket attacks</a> and crossed that line. Now, it's important to keep in mind that embassies are considered sovereign soil of the countries they belong to -- the storming of the embassy was a direct attack on US soil. That, in light of the events in Benghazi several years ago and coupled with crossing the red line was what led to the response. Again, Soleimani was no saint -- his actions are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US troops and the serious injuries of thousands more, along with <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/01/06/793895366/how-are-iranian-americans-reacting-to-the-death-of-gen-soleimani"" rel=""nofollow"">plenty of atrocities in his home country</a>. This was a response years in the making, not simply because of a one-off event like so many of you on the left want to portray it."
"Now, that's not the whole story. There's a strategy at work with this sort of thing that those of you on the left aren't seeing. A straight up war benefits no one in this situation. A war will cost Trump his base, as a large chunk of his base voted for him precisely because they believed he would avoid taking us on a foreign excursion. A war definitely does not benefit Iran -- their economy is weak, their population is discontent, their greatest assets can be easily destroyed without so much as laying a boot on the ground, and they would be up against the most powerful military in the world. No one in the US is talking regime change in Iran like they did back in 2003. There won't be an invasion. No one on either side actually wants a war."
"Trump's action, then, was to up the ante -- not to start a war but to call Iran's bluff and push it to fold. To paraphrase Eliot Ness from the Untouchables: if your opponent pulls a knife, you pull a gun. Iran hit the US and the US hit Iran harder. Iran can try to hit the US even harder than that but the result will be widespread destruction that will cripple Iran and that it likely won't be able to answer. <em>The idea is that, by presenting a response to Iranian violence that cannot be answered, Iran will be dissuaded to respond and instead come to the bargaining table.</em> You don't try to push around the guy who is bigger than you and who has shown a willingness to throw punches. "
"If you hit Mike Tyson, he's not going to hit back proportionately. That's why no one takes a swing at him. We're the United States. You hit us, we're not going to pussyfoot around and take commensurate swipes at you. We will put you into the ground."
"It's a risky strategy that could easily backfire, perhaps too risky, and I don't blame anyone who would oppose it on those grounds. But there <em>is</em> a logic there. It is much the same as what Reagan did with the Soviet Union. When Reagan was elected, everyone was scared to death that he would lead the country into World War 3 due to his aggressive policy against the USSR. He stood up to them, he pushed back, and he didn't bow to their threats. The result wasn't war, but rather a Soviet collapse that <em>no one</em> one would have predicted prior to Reagan's election. "
There isn't likely to be a war with Iran. Iran would be suicidal to continue upping the ante with the cards it holds and it knows it. The war only happens if Iran directly starts it.
"Maybe they have always been chanting ""Death to America"" since we toppled their government in 1953 (Operation Ajax) and because we occupied their close ally in 2003? Just a thought."
Or maybe it was due to Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalizing Iran's oil industry (ie theft) while booting out foreign corporate personnel. 
Now you can argue that Britain had been exploiting Iran since 1913 via AIOC but there were other ways a transition to Iran ownership of the industry could have been achieved.
Why was the Mosaddegh Administration's intentions with his own sovereign country's oil any of our business? Nobody has tried to topple the US government for renting out our oil fields.
Ask the Brits. It was their $ that built the infrastructure in question. 
If you knew history the question would answer itself.
"1901 - William Knox D'Arcy purchased land from the Shah for 20,000 pounds (2.1 million pound value today) for land in what would become Iran. The Shah also received part ownership in D'Arcy's company and a guaranteed 16% of the profits."
"Oil was found in 1908 and APOC was founded in 1909. D'Arcy spent over 500,000 pounds looking for oil and was nearly ruined by the time oil was found."
As more oil was found - all exploration and development paid for by APOC - Iran chafed at the deal and their 16%. They wanted more of the profit.
"From 1923 to 32 Iran attempted to renegotiate the deal, eventually both parties landing in The Hague to settle the dispute."
"A new agreement was ironed out, but WW 2 upset the apple cart a bit with foreign powers seeking to seize the oil fields. "
"By 1950 Iran was again demanding a new deal. In March 1951 Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara was assassinated by the Fada'iyan-e Islam who, coincidentally, wanted to nationalize the Iran oil industry."
You know the rest of the story.
"Like it or not a British entrepreneur used his fortune to build and industry, nearly going bust in the process. 500,000 pounds in 1909 is a massive fortune = to about 52.5 million pounds today."
"The company survived WW 1, the great depression when an oil glut depressed prices and a year's revenue was less than the taxes due the crown, seizure of oil fields in WW 2... Iran took none of the risks during any of this. Then they resort to theft at the point of a gun."
because we occupied their close ally in 2003? 
Close ally? 
Oh dear. You must be young. You've kind of tipped your hand here and shown that you have no clue what you're talking about.
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War"" rel=""nofollow"">Iran-Iraq War</a>"
"Relations were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_relations#Post-war_reconciliation"" rel=""nofollow"">starting to normalize</a> before the US invasion of Iraq. That's a far cry from being ""close allies."""
"<strong>EDIT:</strong> Can someone please explain why I'm being downvoted so heavily here? The assertion that Iran and Iraq were close allies in 2003 prior to the Iraq War is so farfetched as to be absurd. Meanwhile, the poster to whom I'm responding has been spreading pro-Iranian propaganda all over this thread... hence my hostile tone."
Germany was once an enemy of the US. In 2003 Iraq was an ally of Iran. What's your point?
"Apples and oranges. Germany was largely rebuilt by the US post-War and the American-German relationship was <em>never</em> as contentious as that between Iran and Iraq. West Germany and America relied on each other for <em>survival</em> in the Cold War that followed hostilities. Iraq's Ba'ath Regime was Sunni in character. The Iranian government is Shiite. They fought a much longer and much nastier war against one another than you seem to realize -- there was no ""reconciliation"" afterwards for a long time. The two were <em>not</em> friends by any stretch and were only beginning to normalize relations, as I said before."
"But you seem rather insistent. What makes you so certain Iraq was an ally of Iran? Do you have proof of this unprecedented assertion (I've never heard it before, and I've been around for a while now)?"
"And if Iran was Iraq's ally, why didn't Iran step in to help save Saddam during the invasion?"
"I understand the Iran-Iran war was extremely violent. There were somewhere around 500,000 casualties?  But I don't think the differences in how we became allies with Germany and how Iraq became allies with Iran is relevant to this discussion. Shi'ite regimes (Islamic Dawa Party and Islamic Supreme Council) rose to power in Iraq after we deposed of Saddam. Iran funded these parties and gained regional influence whereas Iraq received economic and political stability in return. That makes them allies. Generally states don't like it when their allies are occupied indefinitely"
"You are talking about after the fact of the invasion. From your wording, I was under the impression that you were talking about an alliance prior to 2003."
You stated:
because we occupied their close ally in 2003?
"They weren't their ""close ally"" in 2003 was my point. We didn't occupy an Iranian ally. Certain parties within Iraq became allies of Iran's after the fact and that is something quite different."
It is a common counterintelligence tactic to set up proxy parties in nations that a country wants to make a puppet. Russia accuses the US of having done that in Ukraine with the Euromaiden protests. Iran has been doing the same thing in Iraq and Soleimani has been the one organizing it.
"Tell me something -- as an American, what do you feel you gain from a powerful Iranian presence in the Middle East, one that is able to set up puppet states and create its own sphere of influence? I find it intriguing that you have such a deep commitment to the Iranian framing of this situation."
Actually there's a side to this that I haven't seen discussed. The Iranian people are unhappy. This sent a message that the US would support a revolution.
Consequences. Here you see them represented clearly.
And Iiberals will still tell you they only have a problem with Trump and the GOP lmfao these people are trained to hate the west
In the second picture he should be hiding behind something and pissing himself
Was half expecting the person in the right panel to be wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt
Reddit
"Before:  meh.<br/>
After WWIII!!!!"
I've always felt that this is the one good thing about dealing with terrorists: 
"You never have to worry about pissing them off, because they're already perpetually pissed off."
I wonder why Iran hates America and Israel. There can't possibly be a valid reason for this.
Trump is the only president to have talked the talk and walked the walk in recent American history. I doubt Iran will try their bullshit if they realize the US actually follows up on their threats
Talking the talk and walking the walk... How's the wall going?
"Oh, the wall will be built, even if the democrat traitor try to stop it."
Accurate
All the media freaking out when it’s the same shit different day.  I expect some harassment of vessels in the usual spot and perhaps a terrorist bombing or two.   The usual.
"If you were to believe that the Middle Eastern war zones were only inhabited by Tusken Raiders, you’d almost be correct."
I thought it was death to just Trump.
"Well, that shows that you are poorly informed."
There was an article on the front page about Iran stating it’s beef is solely with Trump.
Oh well I'm SURE that an article on the front page of reddit must be accurate and also sure that Iran is totally telling the absolute truth!
They were chanting Death to America long before Trump
There was an article on the front page about Iran stating it’s beef is solely with Trump.
"TIL that Iran has been regularly chanting ""DEATH TO AMERICA"" for 40 years in anticipation for Trump.  Incredible."
So let’s go to war?
"We killed an enemy combatant in Iraq.  That's it.  He was a very bad man, no shit.  We've been killing enemy combatants in Iraq for 2 straight decades.  News at 11!"
Hopefully this turns into nothing. 
Hopefully Trump turns this into nothing.
"I love how people blindly side with Iran while ignoring their attacks on US nationals in Iran, on US embassies, while ignoring terrorists attacks don’t by terrorist groups openly funded by Iran, and ignoring their open mistreatment of their citizens, denying them freedoms of speech, expression, protest or religions, all under an anti-democracy, anti-west, oil dependent theocracy. "
"But yeah we bombed a general who was a leader of some 30 thousand Iranian Quds, and who just killed a group of protesters because they didn’t align with his crazy ideals. Boohoo we were almost this close... to letting the left convince us to give Iran MORE terrorist funds."
If your point is that relations between the US and Iran have not change so the killing of Soleimani is not that big of a deal then I disagree with you. The significance of soleimani's death lies not in damaged relations but that it's a spark in a cog of gunpowder that is the Middle East.
Although Iranian-American relations have been hostile for ~40 years there has never been such a major act of aggression involved. With this act of aggression any retaliatory or pre-emptive attack will most likely lead to large scale war that will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths at least.
"Yeah attacking a US Embassy, not aggressive at all."
Do you think there's a difference between militia attacking an embassy and a drone effectively assassinating Mike Pompeo?
Edit: Thought he said Solemani since I wasnt paying attention.
"Solemani is a terrorist uniformed combatant, Pompeo is a civilian. Bad comparison."
False comparison. Soleimani was a uniformed combatant and a legit target. Pompeo is not.
"yeah i thought he guy was talking about Solemani, i was not reading right"
Mike Pompeo is a valid terrorist target who mastermind an attack against an embassy?
"My point is that, yeah, the guy was evil and deserved to die. So does Kim Jong Un. And plenty of other authoritarian dictators. The difference between Soleimani and al-Awlaki, for example, is that Soleimani was a very high level figure in a powerful government with huge influence in the region and tons of powerful allies and a much larger army than any other force we've fought in the last 40 years. He wasn't just some terrorist hiding in a compound with porn and a couple armed guards, this was an assassination with tons of political ramifications."
"If a similar attack were to happen on Pompeo (in a world where we didn't assassinate Soleimani), what do you think would be a justified response from the US government?"
"A terrorist was killed in a valid attack, end of discussion. Pompeo isn't a terrorist, the main reason I got my response wrong is because NPCs are boring and I hardly ever read your responses."
"It's not really end of discussion though. The full ramifications of this are yet to come, that's the whole point. It's like saying 'al-Awlaki is dead, terrorism is over.' I would hope both liberals and conservatives can see that"
"He's one of many who needed to be taken out, the day the left can't handle a terrorist being taken out is a day i frankly dont care what they have to say on the matter."
So then the rest of Iran's government needs to be taken out? Are we prepared to go to war to make that happen?
Considering they fund terrorism and killed 1500 of their own citizens sure. But since Trump apparently is a Russian agent he's attacking his own allies so how do you figure into that NPC?
"There have been tons of ""major acts of aggression"" on both sides in the last 40 years, starting with the storming of our embassy. "
It is not at all likely that this attack is going to result in a war.  There is zero upside to a war for Iran.
"Dude you clearly are young and dont remember the Iran Hostage Crisis. It was on the news, everyday, for over a year. It cost Carter his job."
"That happened in 1979 right? So 40 years, like the guy said."
I actually did not know about this. I'll look more into it
Trump made it clear to Iranian top brass thar any retaliation will be met with bombs on their defense ministry.
Do you think they believe him when he says that now?
[removed]
This is obtuse. Iran has not been adhering to the treaty and no intention of adhering to it in the future.
"The only time that the United States should be killing generals is if we are involved in a declared war. You just pointed out that we had a treaty with Iran that we broke, and you're using that as a justification for an extrajudicial killing"
"General is also a spymaster and terrorist. We broke no treaty with Iran - we exited the poorly conceived Obama nuclear deal. For a handful of promises Obama unfroze Iran's assets, sent them pallets of cash etc... "
And HERE is the kicker - the agreement had a 10 year expiration clause. So even if Iran followed the terms 100% they'd be free to restart their nuclear program in 2025. 
But that's moot since Iran has been violating the deal for some time.
Here is a UN report from 11/2019
"<a href=""https://apnews.com/452a336123d742718027f219f6dd256f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apnews.com/452a336123d742718027f219f6dd256f</a>"
General that wasn't allowed to leave Iran since 2007 yet was in the open at Iraqi Militia funerals after attacks on US embassy.
"Nay Nay, Salami had to pay."
A foreign general responsible for an attack on our embassy?
Do you have any direct evidence whatsoever that he directed or was responsible for the attack on the embassy and that it was not just what exactly it was which is an extension of Iraqs political unrest.
Was he vacationing in Iraq?
So I ask you if you have any evidence and your response is well he must have because he was in the area. So basically what you're saying is that is killing was justified due to circumstantial evidence and that is all the United States needs to execute a lethal strike
"The terrorists started spray painting ""Soleimani is our leader"" on the embassy. By their admission he led them"
Wow that's weird cuz the White House hasn't said anything about his involvement in the embassy attack they keep saying that he was planning future attacks I wonder why if they have evidence that he was behind it they're not sharing it especially when that would absolutely justify their decision. Almost like you're making stuff up (or whatever news source you use is) but that can't be the truth. If the White House is themselves not saying that he was involved in the attack then he wasn't involved in the attack because trust me if they had any evidence of that they'd be screaming it from the rooftops as that would be a concrete justification for the strike.
"I wouldn't trust the White House to be predictable. Anyways, I'll produce a couple links after I eat dinner. Thanks for reminding me that I need a source!"
If any of the links are blogs don't bother. You are admitting that the White House is basically completely mismanaged and incompetent because if they had evidence he was behind the strike they should have led with that as opposed to providing no evidence and isolating and alienating our allies. even if you are correct the best you can say is that the White House totally and completely mismanaged it at the expense of the greater US power and stability in the region.
"The guy was well-known to be in charge of planning and administering Iran's terrorist attacks.  This is not some speculative theory.  It's well-documented.  The fact that he was and continued to be directly involved in orchestrating terrorist attacks made him a combatant, and therefore fair game for killing.  And killing him, rather than merely foiling the latest of a series of terrorist plots, was a much more effective means of stopping such attacks.  As a practical matter, it disrupted Iran's ability to plan and execute such attacks.  It also sent a strong message to Iran that their efforts to escalate this proxy war will not be tolerated, and that the United States is not afraid to directly strike Iranian leadership."
"As unrealistic as it is, if there was another world war who would be our allies?"
"Likely, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO"" rel=""nofollow"">NATO</a> members."
Were looking kind of stacked ngl.
"Yup.  Solid reason our buddies aren't fucked with too often either.  Mess with a NATO member, you're messin' with all NATO members."
"the bigger question, who is going to go toe to toe with us over a piss-ant country like Iran"
I mean China is Iran's number 1 buyer of Iranian oil.
Didn't downvote you:  but the most recent data I can find shows Iran as being only China's #3 supplier.  You just don't go toe to toe with the world's only superpower over your 3rd biggest supplier of anything.
"Let me put this in other words to clarify, China is Iran's biggest <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=where+does+iran+export+oil+to&amp;oq=where+does.iran+export+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2.4992j0j9&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">customer</a>. You understand that Iran can be Chinas #3 supplier, and #1 buyer of Iran oil at the same time right?"
"Let me put this in other words to clarify, China gets to decide what China does, and China is motivated by things that are important to China, not Iran.  What is important to Iran is not important to China just because they are important to Iran, even if, indeed, they are important to Iran.  I hope that was clear."
k
"Russia, probably. The US and Russia only ever see eye to eye during warfare, but we consistently band together during world wars*. Also, Russia tipped us off about the embassy and we tipped them off about a plot in Moscow (<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/30/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-discuss-better-u-s-russia-relations/2773031001/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/30/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-discuss-better-u-s-russia-relations/2773031001/</a>)"

You are aware that this sentiment is fomented by The Iranian government and the conservative wing of that government aren't you? All of the Persians I know love America. Many of them came here because they hate their government. We must be careful to not generalize people for what their government does. This cartoon is also telling in that it apparently tells us that Soleimani's killing was completely unnecessary i.e. it didn't change anything in the mind of this cartoonist.

Who said it's no gain? The meme points out there is no change to their attitude. Killing him didn't sour relations because they were already bad.
Or were you trying to ignore that to score a rage point?

How incompetent of a government do you have to be that you can't even hold a state funeral without causing the deaths of a few dozen people?

"In 1989, a <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-06-mn-1929-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">funeral procession in Tehran</a> for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was interrupted when his half-naked remains toppled out of an open coffin live on state television. Mourners had blocked the path of a truck carrying the deceased leader of the Iranian revolution and tore at his burial shroud, knocking his body to the ground. That led the broadcast to be cut short and his body airlifted by military helicopter away from the crowd until his remains could be rewrapped."
"Oh, Iran. Go to a funeral and stay for the funerals.."
"The IRANY of the stampede is they were chanting ""Death to America"" while being pounded into the concrete by their fellow barbarians."

Wow. They keep chipping away and we keep allowing it.
"You say that, but how many cities in Virginia are becoming 2A Sanctuary Cities? Police are basically refusing to comply. The national guard as well. These laws are unconstitutional on their face, so they can pass them all they want, they're not going anywhere and no one is going to go along with it."
Then screw the frigging sanctuary bullshit and appeal this shit to the Supreme Court before Blackface Northam and Rapey Fairfax strip Virginians of every firearm

It's funny they charge more for learning to shoot than for stealing. Glad to see their priorities.
Well fuck Virginia I guess lmao
"Dangerous precedent being set here. Granted, the bill doesn't completely outlaw indoor gun ranges, but it does make it difficult to have one. And, it makes it doubly challenging to have a ""well-trained militia."" By placing an obstacle between a person and proper gun handling, the VA government is ensuring people misuse their firearms. "
Dangerous precedent indeed.
So the government needs to know how to shoot but not us. Hmmm.....
This bill is squarely targeted at the NRA's range in their HQs. It only applies if you have 50 employees in the building. 
And of course there's the now obligatory LE exemption. They aren't even hiding the tyranny.
I just moved to Virginia and want to learn how to shoot. So now I can’t?
"None of these bills have passed yet, and it's unlikely any of them will. Don't worry.  If you're in Northern Virginia, I recommend Gilbert's Small Arms Range. It's where I learned to shoot."
I will look into it! We are only stationed here for a little while and I want to get proficient ASAP!
Section B of this bill needs broken down into a more easily read format:
It is unlawful to operate an indoor shooting range in any building not owned or leased by the Commonwealth or the federal government <strong>UNLESS:</strong>
(i)     fewer than 50 employees work in the building
<strong>OR</strong>
(ii)
"(a) at least 90% of the users of the indoor shooting range are law-enforcement officers, as defined in <em>9.1-101,</em> or federal law-enforcement officers,"
"(b) the indoor shooting range maintains a log of each users name, phone number, address, and the <strong>LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHERE SUCH USER IS EMPLOYED</strong>"
<strong>and</strong>
(c) the indoor shooting range verifies each users identity and address by requiring all users to present a government-issued photo-identification card.
​
"So according to part (i) you can have an indoor range in any building as long as fewer than 50 people work in the building. As some have mentioned this seems like it is targeting the NRA's HQ range. I could see them arguing it's purpose is to prevent someone from putting an indoor range in one of the hundreds of empty Sears, Dillards, etc that share a building with a mall with hundreds/thousands of ""soft targets"" around. Would seem weak to me."
​
"Part (ii) seems to be geared towards city/locality owned ranges. For example, if a city police department has its range in the basement of some administrative/training building where more than 50 employees work. The building isn't owned or leased from the Commonwealth or feds, it is probably owned by the city. All the log and ID requirements only apply to this sort of range... because (a), (b), and (c) are all listed under part (ii)."
​
At first read this seems like little would change with most local indoor ranges. That being said....I am interested to hear how it is presented/debated. Maybe my understanding of English is slipping in my old age.
God that’s insane
What is the purpose of this bill? This seems like a completely unnecessary law.
This one is aimed specifically at the NRA headquarters.  Pure petty spite.
Maybe I'm reading this wrong but I don't think it makes them illegal unless they don't meet certain criteria.  Namely if the business has more than 50 employees or they fail to ID people?  Correct me if I'm interpreting this wrong. 
"""B. It is unlawful to operate an indoor shooting range in any building not owned or leased by the Commonwealth or the federal government unless (i) fewer than 50 employees work in the building or (ii) (a) at least 90 percent of the users of the indoor shooting range are law-enforcement officers, as defined in § 9.1-101, or federal law-enforcement officers, (b) the indoor shooting range maintains a log of each user's name, phone number, address, and the law-enforcement agency where such user is employed, and (c) the indoor shooting range verifies each user's identity and address by requiring all users to present a government-issued photo-identification card."""
"Wtf is the point of this law?! Are there a lot of shooting ranges that employ more than 50 people, why does that matter?"
Almost sounds like they want to know the identity of anyone and everyone shooting.
Almost sounds like they want to know the identity of anyone and everyone shooting.
"I know you're copy/pasting this, but when you do, it should at least make sense. The reply has nothing to do with the amount of employees a shooting has."

Wtf is the point of this law?!
To which I replied
Almost sounds like they want to know the identity of anyone and everyone shooting
"I'm not sure why you felt the need to reply in such a way that didn't contribute to the discussion in the first place, but my reply certainly made sense."
The problem is why do they need this law?
Ya I agree with you. Almost sounds like they want to know the identity of anyone and everyone shooting
it looks like it makes them illegal unless the building is owned by the state or federal government and 90% of the users have to be law enforcement. Thats peak rules for thee but not for me right there.
"So many ""and's"" and ""or's"" makes dissecting this confusing"
"(b) the indoor shooting range maintains a log of each user's name, phone number, address, and the law-enforcement agency where such user is employed, and (c) the indoor shooting range verifies each user's identity and address by requiring all users to present a government-issued photo-identification card."""
"this is the part that should scare you. Either your gun range closes down, or you keep a registry of all of your customers, their address and phone number? How convenient is that? Once the actual gun bans start, you go to the ranges, collect the membership information, then go house to house collecting the guns."
"Clauses (i) and (ii) are separated by ""or"", while the (a)(b) and (c) subclauses of (ii) are separated by ""and"".  So basically for an indoor range to be allowed under this law, it would either have to employ less than 50 people, or it would have to be 90% LEO used, with those LEOs (and guests, which is what the 10% would allow) having their contact info, agency, and photo logged."
"So as far as the non-LEO citizens go, only the ""fewer than 50 employees"" matters.  The big question is how many indoor ranges actually employ more than 50 people?  The only one that comes to mind to the Virginians I've heard from is the range at the NRA headquarters, which makes this bill sound much more like a personal vendetta against the organization than any ""gun safety"" measure."
Thanks for clearing that up. Sometimes legalese makes me go crosseyed.

Traitor
No wonder Sloppy Joe and his fellow Democrats are so eager to keep Crackhead Hunter out of the national spotlight--Burisma is actually a career triumph compared with his other escapades.  He's one of the scuzzier douchebags since Martin Shkreli and Jeffrey Epstein.  Next we'll hear about his necklace made from underage hooker's teeth.
Hollywood definitely should not be dictating state policy: Here's a recap and rant
"Bill Cosby drugging and raping women, Woody Allen marrying his wife's adopted child, Weinstein sexually assaulting people, Huffman and Loughlin bribing the system so their kids get into universities, Polanski raping some girl and escaping to Europe, Jussie Smollet faking a hate crime (and getting a slap on the wrist), Bowie/Jackson/R.Kelly/Tyga/a myriad of other rockstars doing terrible shit. And the average Joe is forced to listen to them, because they control the medium. "
"Hollywood is constantly going on-and-on about anti-vax, organic veganism, shaming people for not driving expensive hybrid/electric cars, shaming people to make reparations to people they never wronged, telling people they aren't cool because they don't have the right skin color, and people of a specific color are more equal than others, telling people the law is a sham because it doesn't apply to celebs - therefore down with rule of law for everyone else smh."
"Every goddamn self-righteous celeb supporting Hillary and telling average Americans are idiots and deplorables was a middle finger to good Americans. Trump was just a small push for a little bit of fairness, to retain just a little bit of autonomy from some tax-happy career bureaucrat."
"Avicii, Tom Petty, Phillip S. Hoffman, Heath Ledger, and countless other celebrities all died of drug overdoses, so the media establishment (who are junkies) shaming people to decriminalize their next fix. Soon, they'll be saying everyone should legalize a new set of happy drugs, and everyone will be on the government dole for soma made by Uncle Sam."
"And somehow, celebs with all of their dysfunction, get the harebrained idea to tell average Americans that they somehow know what's good for me and mine? "
"All that Hollywood money didn't do shit for Hillary, and it ain't going to do nothing for Biden, Sanders, or Warren. "
"The vast majority of their views on gun control, frankly, boggle the mind. Why would Hollywood need guns when they have bodyguards following 24/7? It is ironic that Hollywood, of all institutions, would oppose gun violence when nearly every movie &amp; tv studio perpetuates it. De Niro talking about gun violence while reaping the benefits of gun violence in movies is hypocritical. Drug dealers have Godfather posters in their cribs ffs. It's easy to say yes to illegal immigration when celebs and their industry are not impacted by it. Some applicants now are asked if they can speak Spanish for entry positions. Learning another language for the well-to-do with a private tutor and free time is easy, but try doing that while working two factory jobs.  "
"Those Hollywood idiots need to remember what happened to regular people during the L.A. riots, when LAPD took a couple days off while downtown L.A. burned. "
"Hollywood celebs can pay for their own 24 hour private doctors, they aren't affected by the never-said-but-implied-bankrupting tax increases associated with universal health care. Celebs don't need to schedule an appointment six months in advance when, inevitably, everyone on the universal health care system gets sick. "
"Did any Hollywood celebrity get thrown out on the street during 2008 financial crisis? Oh wait, those assholes in Hollywood buy their houses in cash! "
"Celebs launder their money and stash them in Panama, Mauritius, or Lichtenstein (check out the Panama papers).  And even if they paid taxes, they don't wince paying half of 10 million, because that's still 5 million in their pocket. The point is, the celebs can espouse some batshit tax policy, but they're not hurt by it, not like the average Joe. "
"A lot of good Americans are living on the edge, and they don't got five million in their pocket. They were told that free trade was a ""net-plus"" and that illegal immigration is a net gain for the economy. For whatever reason, all this liberal shit didn't workout as good as the original government grant funded thesis said it would be. Normal people said no to illegal immigration and unfair-free-trade, and those celebs and their media machines shamed and slandered goodhearted Americans and called them racists."
They deserve a lot worse than some jokes at their expense.

I know where this plant is.  All it ever did was line former Senator Reid's pockets with money.
"Solar will never be a primary source of energy.  Germany has tried to be exclusive solar and wind, and their energy costs have gone up."
"Comparatively, France is primarily Nuclear, and their energy costs went down."
"Solar and wind have a host of problems that you just can’t fix.  Both require weather cooperation for maximum efficiency, which is impossible, and both have issues of maintenance and repair."
"Wind has issues with broken turbines and occasional fires (and killing birds) and solar requires the mining and use of toxic metals, which is seemingly ironic as broken or trashed panels risk exposing those metals into the environment."
"I’m looking forward to modern thorium reactors, and India is looking a developing them for their grid.  The US has had thorium testbeds in the past, but I don’t know if any are running."
There is no purely thorium reactors currently. Plans for them have been made and discussed but thorium has only been used in minimal amounts with other elements if ever used which is rare. I believe the US is suppose to be building a full functioning one soon tho.
Is there a reason we are trying to save coal when nuclear is a better option?
Because you shouldn’t shut down an industry until you have something to replace it with.  
"The main appeal of coal, obviously, is its cheap, and even in “eco friendly” areas they often use coal as backup power at night if there is higher demand."
Look where the article came from lmao
Shouldn't this be viewed as a positive?
"No, a waste of our money is never positive"
"It is a cautionary tale that the technology isn't ready for widespread use. Even if you look past the incredible costs (financial and environmental), the advancements happening make any implementations at scale untenable."
Yeah this giant circle of mirrors shit is not ready for widespread use. The article clearly shows how traditional solar panels are decreasing in price and will continue to be more productive and an excellent alternative energy resource than this hot mess of a project was.
"Solar and wind can never be a viable replacement for traditional energy sources because it is too sporadic. There is no viable way to store excess capacity on high output days and on low output days, they can never meet demand so they must always be backed up by traditional power plants. Germany is learning this the hard way. They are having to pay neighboring countries to take their excess capacity on high output days and still operate and maintain a network of coal plants to fire up when output is too low to meet demand."

"“The Black Book of Communism,” a postmortem of communist atrocities compiled by European and American academics in 1997, concluded that the human cost of genocides, extrajudicial executions, deportations, and artificial famines stood at over 94 million.... No matter where it was tried, communism has always resulted in mountains of dead bodies. As for socialist economics, it has always resulted in shortages, inefficiency, poverty, and desperation. <a href=""https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/100-years-communism-death-deprivation"">The verdict of history is clear, but only if people are willing to see it.</a>"
"Sadly Bernie and his supporters ""don't see it."""

Bernie wants to be one of the leaders.

"Long story short, most Iranians are happy to see sol, go."
"Here is a post from <a href=""/r/texas"">r/texas</a> that has a comparison of whats on fire to the size of our state. When I saw the abc map I was trying to figure out who was right. "

"I think the reason most ""news"" outlets or ""journalists"" express the size of land area in acres is because the definition of an acre is so poorly understood by the public. As your link stated, there are 640 acres in a square mile, so an acre is a square approximately 208.7 feet (or about 63.6 meters, if you prefer) on a side. "
"The problem is that few people can visualize or understand those numbers without something to compare them against, leaving the door open for maps that could be wildly inaccurate yet still accepted by the average Joe. Obviously, ""journalists"" aren't chosen for their math or cartography skills, and frequently fuck up simple calculations."
Not fake. Check your facts.
Australia: North-South 3600KM &amp; East-West 4000KM
United States: North-South 2500KM &amp; East-West 4800KM

This post isn't about the size of Australia. It's about the size of the fires. I assume you didn't even open the article? But took the time to pull up the country dimensions? Strange world we're living in.
Nobody said anything about the size of Australia  compared to the US. 
"According to Alexei, ABC News editor Matt Zarrell ""Appears [to have] used Himawari-8 🛰️ thermal anomalies ('hotspots') from Jan 2 ... so anything hot (cars in full sun, industry)+ fire used in land mgmt."" In other words, that's not a map of stuff on fire, but a map of virtually anything in Australia that gets hot enough in direct sunlight to get picked up by a very sensitive Japanese weather satellite."

...remember who/what her constituents are! I hope you're right!!
"From seeking to very much happening, while we sit and fetter away any chance of retaking the House while Republican veterans of the House are retiring like people fleeing a sinking ship. Democrats are heading for the far left and in states like Virginia, Kansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, even in my North Carolina, they’re not losing ground, they may even gain ground in my state. At least in Kansas, Louisiana and Kentucky the GOP managed to hold the Legislatures, for now. "
"This is not the year for complacency, I don’t care who you are, or where you live, if you aren’t out there helping campaigns, trying to run yourself or even voting, you’re doing far less then what AOC will get her party and the people in it to do, even if it costs them in the short term,  she’s dragging them to the left so that any victory in future means goodbye to capitalism or even a mixed economy, goodbye to the interpretation we put on the 2nd Amendment, goodbye to small businesses being given a chance to grow to create local jobs, or big businesses the chance to expand into more states. "
"The stakes are so beyond high, that every single statement by Democrats that sounds horrific to us and common Americans, and isn’t turned into an ad a week later, is a loss we can tack on the board. It’s giving a free pass for them to hold the House and damage the Senate majority the GOP has. If we don’t fight back now, yes even in January, I can assure you it won’t matter a damn what we do in July or August, and it will show in November."
If only the blue dpgs understood that.
"They already are a portrait of Marxism, they just aren't ready to take the mask off and show the American people their true face. Although, they will show some ankle to those paying attention. AOC is too stupid to realize that her impatience is going to fuck it up for all of them."
"I imagine it’s somewhere in between. The regime has supporters who I’m sure came out in support of him, others were socially pressured or physically coerced. It’s not a wholly natural thing but I imagine their society has some similarity to ours in its veneration of the military and people bought into this guy being a superhero."
"I mean, is it really that hard for you not to call someone he or she if they do not like being called that?"
Is it really that hard to understand that the rest of the world has no need or desire to play into those delusions?
"People who expect the rest of us to modify language based someone feels that day don’t understand the function of pronouns. They are, by definition, generic and impersonal."
I've grown libertarian on this after doing it a couple of times now:
It wasn't actually that hard to adjust to it the couple of times I was around a trans person.
"If they'd asked me to call them by a nickname I would do so - hell, I prefer going by a shortened version of my name and would find someone to be a bit of a dick for using my full name after I've asked them to use my nickname."
"None of this is to say you can't or shouldn't make jokes, but we deal with delusional people all the time (flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, etc.) and any decently polite person will just humor them long enough to politely excuse themselves from the conversation."
Make it my choice and maybe I will.
"Make it no choice and I'll call you whatever I feel like, because I'm give-a-shit fluid."
"It requires almost no effort on your part. So I dont see what the issue is. If someone in some way informs you that they prefer different pronouns, why not just got with that?"
It also doesn’t require much effort on my part to engage with someone who thinks they’re Napoleon. I have no interest in participating in or encouraging the delusions of someone who is clearly not healthy.
Encouraging fantasy is harmful and history is going to look back on this crap the same way we look at the lobotomy today.
"Edit - just to be clear, I wouldn’t go out of my way to use the “incorrect” pronouns and would more than likely just refer to that individual in the third person. But I’m not going to rewrite English grammar for them."
And that's perfectly fine. My only issue is people who go out of their way to upset those who prefer different pronouns. Or make fun of them in front of them.
It requires no effort on your part to refrain from <strong>forcing</strong> me to use made-up words like xe or xer.

"To figure out what the Dems are really doing here, we need to read between the lines. They are pretending like they want to compel certain witnesses, but they are really terrified that the Republicans will call other witnesses they don't want questioned outside of Schiff's closed star chamber. "
"This is likely to end with many Democrats pleading the 5th including the Presidential frontrunner. They have no power to stop any of this.

This peckerhead makes me embarrassed to say I live in NY
The media is going to say the US is alone and Iran isn’t.. but it’s quite literally the opposite. 
Unless China or Russia backed them with troops arms materials and fought side by side they wouldn’t stand a chance. Terror cells survive they don’t lose they pick themselves up and move. You can’t destroy beliefs. But Iran isn’t going anywhere.
So far it doesn't seem like Russia or China are budging for Iran.
and why would they?
No reasons. Other than oil they probably don't give two shits about Iran at all.
"Russia has had a Sunni Chechen problem for a while now, Beslan, the Moscow Theater hostage crisis, St. Petersburg metro bombing. "
China's rounding up Sunni Uighurs nonstop because of their fight against the PRC.
"China and Russia are kidding themselves if they think they won't get burned down with the Iranian ""good"" Islamists (Hezbollah). The USA shouldn't back the Sunni Salafist Saudis just because China and Russia are half-heartedly backing the Shia Iranians."
Let the Sunnis and Shia kill each other and let them fight it out in Russia and China's backyard.
We would destroy them. They don’t stand a chance.
"They can't even defend against Israel, do people really they could defeat the US?"
"Iran is like your neighbor's small and yappy dog that won't shut up. Lots of bark, but no bite!"
No more wars why does every want needless wars
"It’s not about wanting war, quite the opposite."
The reason I don’t worry about a war with Iran is because Iran knows such a war would be unwinnable.
"I don't really trust the press sources, I'm going after whats being said by world leaders and their subordinates.  They flat out said they have something up their sleeve coming that is terrible and would have never seen coming."
Someone break down everything for me.
How unlikely or likely is a chance for war? Should I be concerned? Not really educated on this stuff.
"A war with Iran wouldn't mean much to the average American since we can project a lot of power without many ""boots on the ground"".   I don't see Trump trying to occupy Iran when doing so in Iraq, a much smaller country, went so poorly."
Just all the talk of Iran retaliating and all my friends being scared shitless and acting like this is a massive ordeal has got me shook up. Sorry for sounding a bit idiotic.
Obviously your friends aren't old enough to remember 9/11/2001.
Yeah true. 
I think they’re just really worried about the draft. I think(hope at least) there’s  a slim chance of that though.
We had thousands of Americans murdered on US soil.  The Pentagon itself was attacked.  Two of the most iconic buildings in the US were destroyed.  We ended up invading and occupying two countries.
No draft.

Doesn't make his speech any less funny though.

"Then, they gave their 302s (notes) to an FBI attorney who, surprise surprise, determined he perjured himself"
"Democrats then dragged him through court, bankrupted him, and used it as ‘proof’ Trump is a Russian spy"
"Let Flynn keep exposing the lies by the FBI and DoJ, hopefully until after the election."
Pardon him if the crap judge actually forces him to serve time.
Then renominate him to National Security Advisor.

"The FBI and DoJ have been exposed as lying and fabricating evidence to spy on innocent Americans.  They pretty clearly targeted Flynn because they were afraid that he would expose their corruption (and since Obama tried to keep Trump from nominating him, it seems clear that Obama was involved in the illegal spying on Trump and his campaign)."
"Remember, the DoJ destroyed massive amounts of evidence when ""someone"" (they don't have any record of who) wiped the iPhones and deleted all text messages of Lisa Page and Strzok."

The damning messages we do have are just whats left from their older phones.
His motives remain unclear.......
Dang. He kills 40 people while he is dead.
It beyond fifty now!
"Probably a true death count, but the 40 dead were probably counter protesters.  I so hope Iran knows they are alone in the world, and I do hope they do something stupid ( ideology says they will) , and we just fucking take out all of their oil refineries and starve these fucks into the ground.   take out dams, and electrical facilities.  These dip shits have no idea we can send them into the stone age in 4 hours.    WTF - I thought Persians we smart?"
Impeachment #2 coming right up.  Bring it.  You're voting on your own pink slip.
"Icing on Trump's re election cake, my friends...icing on Trump's re election cake."
Soleimani orchestrates numerous acts of war against the United States and Trump retaliates - perfectly justified. Too bad Schiff won’t give us a straight answer about what his issue with the operation is.
Edit: clarity
Schiff has to be the worst poker player on earth.
"So the intelligence is unassailable when it says what you want it to say, but suspect when it doesn't benefit your party?"
"He was a designated terrorist, with travel restrictions in place, found in foreign country, involved in war crimes, attacks against American embassy, in the company of militia leaders planning additional attacks. A damn shit, cannot understand those facts, he should be. Removed from Intelligence committee."
Hahaha. It will never happen.
That's insane.
"They need to punish him for exposing that they fabricated ""evidence"" against him.  And they need to hurry up before Barr starts showing how much the DoJ and FBI have colluded to spy on and  frame innocent people."
"EDIT: McCabe was involved in setting up Flynn, who has been proven to have lied to the FBI.  Why isn't he being prosecuted?"

"While I don't agree with it, if that's the standard, then Comey, McCabe and Brennan should each get 20 years."

The laws around Chain migration and Anchor kids should be changed. What other countries have this sort of laws? 
"1 or both parents should have to be citizen for the child to qualify.   Every adult should have to go through the process and cut the chain part. 1 person was allowed in , not there 18 relatives ."
Like Melanie’s parents?
"If you dont like it vote in favor of politicians who will to end it.  Unfortunately most of the left candidates are pandering to the woke individuals by saying they want the ""dreamers"" to get to America.  Vote in favor of candidates who want to slow the illegal and chain  migration into this country."
You mean where Kerry is secretly meeting with Iranians in France after they threatened to release a list of people they bribed?
Surprised to learn he is still alive.
"i know, i thought for sure he would have been in the car with Soleimani"
"If people act crazy and hurt themselves under the guise of the world ending in 10 years, would that fall under the “yelling fire in a theatre” restriction of free speech? "
It’s obvious very few of the alarmists genuinely believe the world will end shortly. Trying to convince others it is can be potentially endangering to the public.
Every 20 years since the 70’s we’ve only had 10 years left.

"The best course of action would be for Jane, Steven et al to dial it back and concentrate on the science: not hysterical mob ""science"" but real science, with careful observation and rigorous skepticism, testing of hypothesis and analysis.

<strong>Article:</strong>
"While reasonable people can debate the wisdom of killing Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, there is little doubt that President Trump acted lawfully—under both domestic and international law—in ordering his death. The president has the constitutional authority to take military actions, short of declaring war, that he and his advisers deem necessary to protect American citizens. This authority is extremely broad, especially when the actions must, by their nature, be kept secret from the intended target."
"Congress has the sole power to “declare war,” but it hasn’t formally exercised that power since World War II. Since then, the U.S. has fought long and costly wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan."
"To be sure, there have been congressional votes, often vague and controversial, authorizing some military actions, while others were conducted without any congressional input. And there are serious scholarly debates about whether full-scale undeclared wars are constitutional. The courts have declined to resolve that question. But there can be no serious debate about the president’s constitutional authority to order a single attack on an enemy combatant who has killed and is planning to kill American citizens. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama issued such orders."
"Critics of the order to kill Soleimani claim that this military action was different, because it could provoke a full-scale war if Iran decides to retaliate. They argue that Congress must authorize any military action that might result in an all-out war, declared or undeclared. But virtually any military action could escalate into a war, as evidenced by the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which started World War I."
"The targeting of Soleimani was more justified, as a matter of law, than the targeting of Osama bin Laden in 2011. The killing of Soleimani was in large part an act of prevention, whereas the killing of bin Laden was primarily an act of retaliation. Would anyone doubt that if Mr. Clinton had succeeded in killing bin Laden before 9/11, as he tried to do, such an action would have been legal under American law? So, too, was it legal for Mr. Trump to order the targeted killing of Soleimani, who was planning to continue his killing spree against Americans."
"The killing of Soleimani was also entirely legal under international law. The Quds Force commander was a combatant in uniform who was actively engaged in continuing military and terrorist activities against Americans. The rocket that killed him and a handful of others was carefully calibrated to minimize collateral damage, and the resulting death toll was proportionate to the deaths it may have prevented."
"The killing took place in a foreign country, but so did the killing of bin Laden and others who have been targeted. U.S. military and civilian personnel are in Iraq with Baghdad’s approval and have the legal authority to protect Iraqi and American citizens and to neutralize threats to their lives. All the relevant criteria for legality under international law—using authorized and proportionate force to kill a combatant who is engaged in continuing violence—have all been met in this case."
Why then are so many accusing Mr. Trump of acting unlawfully under both domestic and international law? Would the same legal criticism be leveled at Mr. Clinton or Mr. Obama if he had successfully targeted Soleimani? Are the legitimate concerns about the wisdom of the action motivating the baseless criticism of its legality?
"Whatever the motivations for trying to find or invent legal objections to the killing of Soleimani, such efforts are dangerous because they could constrain future presidents from taking military actions that are necessary and proper to protect Americans. Let’s continue to debate the wisdom and long-term implications of Mr. Trump’s decision, but let’s not conflate wisdom and policy with legality."

Good read
"In any other country she wouldn't be where she is right now at all, LOL."
She might be the PM of Sweden...
"Ah, true. Sweden is a weird and backwards place."
"In other countries,  she could call herself a communist."
Someone should inform her that there are in fact more than two political parties in the united states and she can change her affiliation even while in office.
"So move there, crybaby."
"In any other country you'd be locked up, effing fruit cup."
In any other country she'd still be a bartender
Well yeah most countries with a pareliment system have coalition groups of parties. That's how they all have a socialist party that does so so. That's exactly where she would be. Over with the socialists yelling for more taxation.
"A Labor Party would be most interesting. Representing the working classes and their platform would be and often is an entirely Economical platform focusing on full employment, job training, flat taxes and the Land Value Tax (which is basically 100% agreed upon by conservative and liberals as the perfect tax). Taxes not taken out of your hard work but taxes taken from Rent. 
The Rent is the land and the value of the land. Effectively turning “taxes” into rent is much friendlier and allows you the individual to keep their entire paycheck and not lose 30% from let’s say NY state"
I think we can all agree though that they're both fucking nuts.
"She is correct. Osasio Cortez is a social democrat. Social democracy is not socialism, and Joe Biden is not actually a Democrat but more of a Manchester Liberal. Still the neoliberalism inside of the American political bureaucracy is tragic. 
There should multi parties."
"Oh, please explain. ""Social democracy is NOT socialism?"""
I think we have too many people just making up terms.  What in the actual fuck is a Manchester liberal?
"It's like saying ""Spousal rape is NOT rape."" Because in spousal rape you get to choose your rapist whereas in regular rape it's just some random rapist abusing you."
"Gang rape isn't rape, it is merely ""social sex"" because a majority agreed on it."
“democratic sex” because 9 out of 10 voted for it.
That's an even better analogy.
Social democracy is not socialism
I too want this explained. Preferably with definitions and compare/contrast platforms.
"The way I kind of look at it is &lt;adjective&gt; &lt;noun&gt;. Social democrats are liberals (not 'Liberals') that want higher taxes and a strong safety net beneath a market economy. Examples are like Denmark where they tax a lot, but they provide lots of universal, social services. If you look at lefty pages, they <em>hate</em> social democrats because social democrats are still ""capitalist pigs"", lol."
"Democratic socialists are full blown socialists with democratic tendencies and ideals. They would advocate public ownership of the means of production, and that the public has a say in that economy. An example of that could be like the public owns the economy and everyone can vote on referendums over what the economy should do. Kind of like if the public was a shareholder or on the board of every company. A Soviet system is like authoritarian socialism. So, democratic socialism operates like that but with strong democratic systems and ideals. I don't know of any current democratic socialist society."

"Thanks for sharing this, in the UK we have just had an election, where a socialist Labour party promoting all of these ideas was thankfully decimated."
"So we have been saved from being dragged down by their hatred of the very people who they claim to be protecting, the average working person."
"Missiles fired, a horrific plane crash, and now an earthquake? They're having an interesting day in Iran, to say the least."
"A <em>really</em> interesting day if that earthquake was a secret underground nuke test, or a bunker busting MOAB courtesy of the USAF."
the earthquake originated from about 10km deep.
From what I've heard 4.9 would be way to big for a nuke test.  Iran gets a lot of earth quakes.

"Were you taught that 2+2=4?  Well listen up, bigot, 2+2 is actually just 1+3. There is systematic racism built into the number line that gives EVEN numbers advantage over the oppressed and innocent odd ones. Even the name, “odd”, is racist.  The evens made it up so as to convince everyone that being an odd is somehow a negative thing. "
"Clearly, the system must be torn down and built anew. "

1 and 3 are prime numbers.  They have prime privilege!
"Funny, but 1 is actually not considered a prime number in modern mathematics."
1...the Asian number in intersectional math...
Two libturds are approaching each other going 2 mph on their electric scooters. One leaves Starbucks at 8 pm and the other leaves Patagonia at 6 PM. At what point will the two libturds intersect at a Chik-Fil-a protest.
How the fuck are these terrorists even part of the UN? Worthless organization.
I think it’s time they sat on the human rights council.
Right next to the leader of the human rights council... Saudi Arabia.
"Well, they do know what human rights violations look like."
That's...the whole point of the UN. It's SUPPOSED to be a place where all countries (even the shitty ones like Iran) have a place to air grievances so that we don't end up back in another world war.
"The UN won't prevent a world war, just as didn't do shit about N. Korea building nukes or hundreds of other mass murdering committed by some of these countries."
"The UN isn't a sovereign government and it only has as much power as the weight that the countries that make it up are willing to put behind it.
That generally involves a shit-ton of economic sanctions, which it regularly does. 
If you think we should just invade or bomb whatever country is doing things we don't like, sure, you aren't going to be into the UN, but unfortunately we have to deal with the fact that those countries have sovereignty."
The UN isn't a sovereign government and it only has as much power as the weight that the countries that make it up are willing to put behind i
"In other words, it doesn't have no power whatsoever."
"You're missing the point.
The UN can't prevent wars. It can't prevent weapons of mass destruction in the hands of dictators. It can't prevent mass murdering, bombing of people with chemical weapons, etc. It can't prevent countries from initiating terror attacks against innocent civilians. It can't prevent invasions. There are no shared interests for the organization as a whole because there too many conflicting interests. It can't distinguish between good and evil because it's subjective. "
What is its value if it doesn't have power to stop any of these things from occurring?
Zero.
It can't prevent countries from initiating terror attacks against innocent civilians.
But it can prevent other countries from meddling or saving those innocent civilians from a terrorist government. Like it happened in venezuela. Where the ONU sanctions anyone intrevening and does nothing to enforce that Guaido is president. 
"The ONU is trash. An useless organization that have brought nothing good into the world except, giving criminal credits to useless countries, like mine for example, and their stupid human rights that apparently only apply to thieves, murders and rapist."
But it can prevent other countries from meddling or saving those innocent civilians from a terrorist government
how convenient! /s
Really? So why did Trump ban him if the UN “doesn’t do anything”.
More likely a trump didn’t want to be embarrassed by his blunder on an international scale like always.
But I guess we had this coming.
"lol, do you really believe Iran can embarass anyone? The number one sponsor of worldwide terrorism that murders it's own, hangs gays in public and scolds women to death for infidelity?
If you are embarassed by anything this evil man has to say you are a fool and a hypocrite."
This is Iran’s FM. A diplomat.
"I don’t see Trump banning North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, or Russia."
Banning dialogue is counterproductive and makes us look bad.
"Look bad to whom? Other terrorist regimes?
If you want to hear him talk CNN is happy to interview terrorists."
So far history indicates differently....
How so? There were countless wars since the UN was established. Russia invaded Crimea and they didn't lift a finger as just one example. The peacekeeping force is useless as well:
"<a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-12-11/crisis-peacekeeping"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-12-11/crisis-peacekeeping</a>"
The fact that world war 3 hasn't erupted yet is not something that can be statistically credited to the UN. That's like saying if you drink orange juice and don't have cancer then OJ prevents cancer.
"Nah, the point of the UN is to let well-connected foreign bureaucrats get cushy jobs in the US, bash Israel incessantly, and find ways to expropriate wealth from the west."
Read about UN and then ask why Iran would be invited. School failed you. But you can change that going forward.
"You obviously are so dumb you read that literally. Yes, ALL countries are members of the UN. This is exactly what makes it a useless organization as it's not a coalition meant to protect mankind but rather a political battleground with conflicting interests that ends up achieving nothing."

"What, you made MONEY? As in REAL cash dollars??

Oh my god, you must be like a genius or something!"
Senegal is part of the UN - the UN is fucked up.  some shit hole has a vote because the UN gives them enough money to get off a donkey.
how is the foreign secretary of Iran a terrorist?
"Wow.
He works for a terrorist government that kills their own, hangs gays in public, scolds women to death for infidelity and outsources global terrorism by funding and arming groups like Hezbollah."
If you knowingly work for terrorists what does that make you?
So just like Saudi Arabia?
gay rights and women’s rights are now conservative values? 
The USA armed terrorists (so called moderate rebels) in Syria for years and still does. 
the USA funded terrorists in kosovo to fight against serbia in the 90s (a group the US itself designated terrorists)
what does that make the United States?
"Conservative values include protecting our freedom, and yes that includes women's equal rights. WTF is wrong with you?"
"Also, assuming all conservatives share exactly the same values on every single subject is wrong.<br/>
It's not a homogeneous group. Some support gay marriage, others don't. It's the unfortunate result of having to choose between two parties. Typically neither one will represent 100% of your beliefs. It's a choice between the lesser of two evils."
"Regardless, it's pretty messed up to compare hanging gay people to any type of political conversation going on in America."
women's equal rights
"Sadly this needs definition.  Basic human equality yes, 3rd/4th wave man hating leftist feminism - no way"
I thought those were liberal values. I guess they go down the drain when it comes to cozying up with Iran huh?
"Are you seriously going to compare the US to a terrorist regime that targets and kills innocent civilians? Wow, liberals really have lost it."
"Gay rights and women’s rights  (3rd/4th wave feminism) are NOT conservative rights per se, but not killing people for bad choices is."
"Women's rights in Islam are 1st wave issues, i.e. the vote and being able to drive a car - basic equality which is a conservative value."
By definition dip shit.
Excellent.
I guess AOC will have to fill in for him
I think her aide is filling in her.

Power move
Why is preventing communications between countries a good thing? What the fuck
We don’t let rogue States and ongoing love affairs with terrorizing Americans continue to get away with poking the bear. 
Unless you have a pallet of cash lying around...
The entire point of the UN is so that we can work out the issues between the world and those rogue states in a way that doesn't involve war.
"That would work with, you know, states that don’t go rogue. And will stand by treaties and such. "
"Not states that are used to doing whatever they want by any means necessary. Like, you know, state sponsors of terror."
what’s a rogue state?
One that sneaks around in the dark and gets +5 to backstab.
[deleted]
"You know that treaties have to be sent to Congress, right? Obama didn’t do that with Iran. So, not a treaty. I assume that’s what you’re referring to."
And yet the UN hasn’t stopped these wars from happening. At all. And we get the <em>honor</em> of paying for this privilege and hosting these wonderful people. 
If it were up to me—and clearly it’s not—we’d expel the UN from American soil and leave the organization altogether.
and hosting these wonderful people
Some of whom commit crimes and declare diplomatic immunity!

I'm praying that Trump refusing to let this Iranian minion into the country will cause the UN to leave the US on their own accord.  Set up shop anywhere in the EU they want.  It will be a great day off they get the hell out of our country.
How can the UN stop these wars from happening when you don’t give it power?
The UN is a negotiating platform.
Trump more likely banned him because he didn’t want to be humiliated again on an international scale.
Trumps cry baby behavior to international affairs really needs to stop.
I didn’t see trump ban Russia or North Korea from the UN.
How can the UN stop these wars from happening when you don’t give it power?
"It can't, regardless of how much power it has.  Russia is on the UN Security Council, and would veto any UN action to rein in Iran, just as China would veto any UN action to rein in North Korea."
The UN is a negotiating platform.
It is a giant anti-Israel circlejerk that thinks it is relevant.
Trump more likely banned him because...
...he's been under sanctions since August that prevent him from visiting the US.
"Are you retarded?    Do you 'really' think the UN is a place ""  we can work out the issues between the world and those rogue states ""?    Really?  what fucking planet are you from?  That BS was gone decades ago.  The UN is a place to bash Western culture, at the expense of the US and Western culture by shit hole countries."

Thanks for acknowledging you lost the argument. First one to make a personal insult is the one who is out of ideas...
And war is the best solution? <em>Another</em> war?
We tried it your way. That was simply free cash and broken promises. 
It’s not that anyone on the conservative side wants war. It’s that we don’t back down when someone attacks American soil. And embassies are American soil. 
"Let’s hope Iran is smart enough to know this is a losing hand they’re holding. If they’re not, we cross that bridge."
"I'm out of the loop here, did Iran broke his promises in JCPOA?"

"Careful, you're letting reason get in the way of <em>feeling super alpha</em>."
Why don't you go to live in Venezuela so you can get in line to ask for help to the United Nations and see how effective they are ?

"By allowing a country, who we know is developing nuclear weapons, to run a nuclear program, and then sign a deal which allows them to recieve reactor technology from the west, and to be given money to run that reactor program, Democrats weren't just supporting it, they were funding it."

"Since jury nullification is an icky no-no word to statists on both sides of the phony political divide, the power to determine who is law abiding and who isn't is solely in the hands of the lawmakers who also want to take  your guns"
"Exactly.  I dont see anything about ""law abiding"" in the text of the 2A."

Im all about peace and these people are preventing it.
"So much this.  I'm all about 'green' energy when its economically viable, and even if its only slightly more expensive then the alternative I'd probably still go with it.  I want a clean environment, I have to live here.  I want a clean ocean, I like to swim in it and eat the fish that come out of it.  Its in my <em>interests</em> to have a cleaner more 'green' future.  I feel this is a common stance among conservatives as a whole as well, but the left has apparently no interest in talking to conservatives on the issue in a language they can understand.    "
The issue is a lot of the left wants to use environmentalism as an excuse to radically shift America into communism which is rightfully rejected outright by folks.  We need more conservative politicians to get out in front of the lefties and quit giving them the issue.  Show them a conservative environmentalism as a viable alternative.

"Also, pro-gun democrat, here. There's a lot more of us than you think."
Maybe that's because we never hear democrats speaking up against democratic party insanity and hypocrisy
"I think Democrats are only 'insane' because Fox News paints them that way.  A Democrat pitches gun reform but the message is relayed as 'Democrats want to take our guns'.  It's disingenuous and gross, and the volume of people that buy into that sort of bullshit makes it impossible to have real meaningful discussion on issues.  I don't think I fit the American definition of Conservative any longer, so I'll say as a former Republican and Conservative the second amendment is definitely something I'm sympathetic towards.  Fundamentally I do not trust government, and fundamentally I do believe in having an armed citizenry.  However I also cannot in good faith say I believe we don't have a problem with weapon ownership in this country.  Reform is possible and reasonable, and I thinks its worthwhile for our politicians to discuss what that can look like."

"...because ""gun reform"" always seems to boil down to ""we only want to take <em>some</em> of your guns, or make them prohibitively expensive to own""."
"This is called ""incrementalism"".  Democrats know they can't get away with banning all guns outright, even though that's what many prominent ones have admitted they want to do.  So they do it a little at a time."
"The Founders foresaw this, which is why they prohibited the right to keep and bear arms from being <strong>infringed</strong>."
Maybe that's because you aren't listening to us. I hear it all the time.
Let me explain the logic behind the tweet for those having trouble breaking it down:
"1st point: ""If you think its okay for Iran to have Nukes..."""
"This point is suggesting that there is no way Iran is going to follow any conditions laid out in the Iran Nuclear Deal, so giving them millions of dollars is not only letting them develo nukes (and there is PLENTY of evidence that they have not followed the sanctions/restrictions in the deal), it is funding it. The author is saying that supporting the Iran Deal is no different than ""being okay with Iran getting/having nukes""."
"2nd point: ""Not okay for law abiding Americans to have guns..."""
"This point is talking about those who think that because bad guys are not going to follow gun laws, then banning guns (or certain types of guns) from the U.S. will stop the bad guys from getting guns."
"Now, the crossover between the two points. If you believe that bad guys are not going to follow gun laws so guns laws are not enough, but also believe Iran (a country run by bad people) is going to follow a deal (parallel this with ""gun laws"") so the deal alone is enough, then you might be a Democrat."
"Note: This is not to say that ALL Democrats hold either one or both of these views. But, it is suggesting that if you hold both of these views, then it is highly probable that you are a Democrat. To that, I do not disagree."
"Most of my more liberal friends don't want Iran to have nukes...or anyone for that matter...they just have different ways of getting there. We do disagree on gun rights. I'm not a gun guy and I'll never understand gun worship but I do think that stable, law abiding citizens have every right to arm themselves...the problem with my own argument is who gets to define stable..."
the problem with my own argument is who gets to define stable...
stability should be assumed until proven otherwise via court ordered ruling of mental incompetence.
It's not really the same thing though.
There's obviously a difference between a country being armed (i.e. having an army with access to weapons) and its citizens being armed.
This argument would only make sense if we were talking about people who don't think America should have nukes but Iran should.

Wtf are you talking about? You srsly think that? What about their actions lets you believe that?
what they really want is America destroyed and white people dead.
"Hey man, lets not generalize. Commie scum like the ones we see in Chapo do want this. But I dont think those idiots represent the majority of normal democrats."
Agreed.  We have to stop demonizing and generalizing each other.
They need to start speaking up then.  The divisive rhetoric and outright disdain for white people from their leadership gets no pushback from them if they do exist.
I'll speak up right now for you. The vast majority of Democrats don't think this way. The loud minority that make up crazy news stories you see on T.V aren't indicative of the average liberal.
"Unfortunately it shows up universally within their leadership, rank and file politicians and all of their mainstream media platforms.  For me it is at the point where you’re probably in the minority."
"I think most Democrats don't understand the effects of their policy and don't see how their choice favor Global elites more then themselves. I think it's hyperbole to say they want whites dead but, not if you think they want all threats to their power destroyed by any means."
One has to be pretty far gone to believe any of this. When people want less guns it's because they think it will stop crazy people from shooting others. Also I think there even was a deal to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
"The ""deal"" with Iran was about as retarded as the ""deal"" with American criminals.  ""We'll make it illegal for law-abiding citizens to have guns, but you criminals can keep on breaking the law and doing whatever you want anyway!"".  Trusting Iran to honor the agreement is the same as trusting criminals to obey new laws."
How is this a line of reasoning a thing? Obama established a treaty with Iran (and several European nations) designed to impede Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Trump backed out of that treaty with no new deal to replace it.   
Which party is ok with Iran getting Nukes?
Every liberal I know is against anyone having nukes. Who is this twitter lady talking about?
"The ""Iran Nuclear Deal"" and the pallet of cash certainly won't dissuade Tehran from developing and deploying nuclear weapons."
Only people I've ever meet who are ok with Iran having nukes were Libertarians. Liberals in general are anti nuclear weapons for everyone. 
I guess middle of the road Democrats accept Iran will have nukes at some point in time. I dont see any proof they want that.

"White libs are the most awful, vile, and obnoxious of all people"
I'm going to start with the fact that most Democrats dont want to take guns away from most people or restrict most people from owning guns. What they want is the NRA advocating for known criminals to have access to guns. If you abuse your spouse or partner you shouldn't be allowed to own a weapon.
If you abuse your spouse or partner you shouldn't be allowed to own a weapon. 
That is not where the disagreement lies.
The disagreement comes when the government tries to take away someone's constitutional 2A rights before due process has been carried out.
What they want is the NRA advocating for known criminals to have access to guns. If you abuse your spouse or partner you shouldn't be allowed to own a weapon.
Do you really think conservatives are Not in agreement with you there?
That is faulty logic.
Why can't I own a nuke? What if I want to take down a hostile foreign power when the government does nothing? I should be able to own as many as I want!
Why can't I own a nuke?

Someone hasn’t read the fine print or the big print of the Iran Nuclear Deal that a <em>conservative</em> president backed the US out of.

"Iran is on the brink of economic  meltdown.  Wasting their three refineries puts the country on pure meltdown.  The problem for the people is they have 2M thugs willing to beat down citizens.    iran is a clear cut example of why you need to keep and bear arms.  The Iranian public hates these fuckers, and would toss them out in a heart beat, but they can't."
This should be good.
"I hear Hamas is interested, he's got the arm strength to hurl rocks at Israeli police."
he's got the arm strength to hurl rocks at Israeli police.

"Insane, right?  How the hell does this even happen?"
The one thing that drives me nuts about the Trump Administration is the utter lack of discipline.
I dont think its a lack of discipline Im betting its leakers and this was a trap.
"When I saw it posted on various parts of Reddit, and saw how badly it was written, I figured it wasn't real. "
There's no way that you would handle the pullout that way.

Awwww.
"I feel like this is the case, and if so, the administration staff is not separating personal bias from their duties."
Honestly... this is goofy.
But the other thing we know right now is that there are a bunch of deliberately shitty actors in the government leaking stuff and doing malicious compliance.  So we'll have to wait days to know what really happened here.
"Lack of discipline in cleaning house before he took over, perhaps."
"Most of the procedural issues coming out of the administration are from Obama holdovers or Never Trumpers actively working against him, and the media playing cover for these obvious tactics."
"This is easily the biggest and longest lasting mistake of his presidency. Everything from russia hoax, leaking, and administration hamstringing is from Obama hold overs or never trumpers"
Rush limbaugh was right again.
"Wait, what?"
The NYT is telling lies and somehow liberals are twisting this as being Trump's fault. Is anything not Trump's fault?
It seems to be a leaked draft. The admin still has to many leakers.
"Just because 5% of a story is true, that doesn't mean the story isn't a complete lie. It just means they deviously used 5% truth to make their lie more compelling."
They arent telling lies. Them and Reuters reported on what they were told by the white house.
The  PM of Iraq has the letter.
Wow you have really swallowed those lies whole haven't you.
Huh?
"Did this come from someone close enough to the White House to tie to the White House, or is this just career Pentagon business? Still, huge bungle either way."
I assume this is a partisan general leaking/causing diplomatic trouble for the Trump administration.
it's called incompetence
That's more on the Pentagon than the New York Times.  That drafted letter should have not been leaked.
The memo wasn't even signed.
"It wasn't a draft, it was already translated in arabic, you can see it in the back side of the letter in transparency. "
"And *even* if it was, the meaning of the letter was pretty clear and couldn't have changed significantly. So the ""draft"" spin is pointless."
"I didn't say it was a draft I said it wasn't signed.  Which makes it just words on paper, not a policy, instruction, or order.  Meaning this was a leak at best, or fabrication at worst."
Methink the only fabrication is your spin. The PM of Iraq now says they have a signed copy. In any case they considered the letter to be official.

They sent the letter to Iraq. Not in the NYT at all
More exactly: the letter was released by the Iraq PM.
"How the hell is this on the Pentagon? The NYT has been lying about everything for years, why would you believe a letter was leaked?"
Because it was first released in Iraq by their news network.
"When I think of integrity in journalism, I think of Iraqi propaganda."
I'll withhold judgement for more info to come out.
"Lol, well that's even better. Nothing like old trustworthy Iraq news."
Baghdad Bob has always been the most trusted name in journalism.
How do you know it was authentically transmitted by the Pentagon?
Might have been. All I know is NYT said something so we therefore know absolutely nothing.
"More importantly, by all reports if the letter did actually exist, then it was a draft which was completely taken out of context, which means the NYT was lying."
"LMAO please what was the context of ""as requested by the Iraqi PM and parliament, we are withdrawing unconditionally"" ?"
The letter is here:
"<a href=""https://www.en24.news/2020/01/us-sends-by-mistake-a-letter-announcing-the-withdrawal-of-troops-from-iraq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.en24.news/2020/01/us-sends-by-mistake-a-letter-announcing-the-withdrawal-of-troops-from-iraq.html</a>"
"There is literally no context in which it could mean anything different. This so called ""draft"" meant what it meant and nothing else."
"What does that mean ? Simply that the Pentagon has been replaced by a bunch of incompetent hacks like much of the rest of the Trump ""administration"". This sort of thing never happened under Obama, and it didn't happen when Mattis was at the head. But now that the onanist in chief is surrounded exclusively by bootlicking sycophants, it's no surprise to anyone that this happens on a regular basis."
"The context being lied about here is they were claiming it was released, which it wasn't, it was just a draft. The media pretended it was a real letter that had been sent."
"Nobody claimed it was officially ""released"" by the Pentagon. It was released by the Iraqi government, meaning the Iraqi governement received it before anyone else. We don't know how, if it was sent to them legitimately or illegitimately (leaked) or by mistake (this is the official explanation), but the fact is, the letter meant what it meant and cannot be spun in any other manner. And no general drafts a letter like this without receiving orders coming from very high above, since the president has the sole authority to order such a withdrawal. It simply doesn't happen. And it was already translated into arabic, we can see it translucently on the back of the letter, so it can't have been a hoax. Else they wouldn't have called it a draft sent by mistake, but a hoax."
Iraq had asked for the US to leave in a symbolic vote. He could easily have been wording something up so he had something ready to go in case the order was given to withdraw. 
The NYT reporting a leaked unsigned draft and reporting it as fact without even asking the Pentagon if the letter was legitimate was an outrageous piece of dishonest journalism.
"It has one aim, to disinform their readers and to stir up trouble."
The Wall Street Journal called it a purely symbolic.  I guess the left-wing “news” sites went overboard with their hyperbole again.
I guess the left-wing “news” sites went overboard with their hyperbole again.
They always do the same garbage over and over again.
Leaving a destabilized country is nonsensical. Now that circumstances have been escalated it is going to be now even more difficult to proceed in the future
The idea that people still kinda believe the news is hilarious
.... this was completely on the administration. They released the letter to the Iraq military. Blaming the media is not the move here.
"From the article, it looks like the letter wasn't even sent.  Someone leaked a draft.  "
"""Driving the news: AFP and Reuters set off a frenzy by publishing a letter from Marine Corps Brigadier Gen. William Seely informing the Iraqi military that the coalition to fight ISIS would be ""repositioning forces"" and preparing to move ""out of Iraq"" in the coming days and weeks out of respect for Iraqi sovereignty. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told reporters that the letter was simply a draft and was not meant to be released."
"“That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released…poorly worded, implies withdrawal, that is not what’s happening,"" Milley said."""
"So, it seems to me someone in Gen. Seely's office needs a lesson in confidentiality and discretion."
My fault if misread.
"I think a lot of people are misreading because, again, some news agency ran with a story before verifying all the facts and all the other agencies just copy/pasted the story without going more in depth.  Another testimony to the shameful state of current journalism."
What is shameful is that people's first response is to believe what they are told by the media.
"Yeah- curious what the truth is, as to when it got out and who it went to- whether the press or to Iraq officials."
"That's a good question.  Either would be a huge breach of security, I'm sure."
NYT times lying to the American people as usual.
"Liberals: ""how can we blame Trump for this""?"
"You have no idea whether it was released or not
You were just told that by someone who is likely lying"
Feels like a play by the administration.
"Milley says he was told the draft letter mistakenly suggesting US troops were leaving Iraq leaked: ""It was sent over to some key Iraqi military guys to get things coordinated for air movements ... it went from that guy’s hands to another guy’s hands, then it went to your hands"" "
Sounds like we need better Iraqi military guys.
"The American General Staff is an incompetent mess imo. Between this mess, the Afghan Papers, and soon to be Iraq papers. It is crystal clear that they are effective in short engagements with enemy Air and Naval Forces. However, they are unable to effectively wage a prolonged ground campaign."
"Part of the problem is that military doesn't have clear defined goals of what success and ""winning"" are, and neither does the American public. This is what the major lament of the Afghan papers are- officers complaining that they don't know what the long-term objectives are, and that's a failure of leadership at both the military and political levels."
What are we doing but holding back the tide at this point?
Ooops is an understatement.  Don't give the #left ammo
That sucks
mess
Not sure how they’d have the letter If it wasn’t sent to them.
Fake News? Nah! Never happen! /s

"She endorsed Bernie Sanders for President and just doesn't care about being PC about Israel, doesn't seem antisemitic to me. "
"I'd also like to point to the credulity of the website that did the polling, not really an unbiased source."
A simple google search will give you fine examples of her anti-semitism but then again your response “she endorsed Bernie..” so thus she must not be anti-Semitic. LoL dude that argument is so weak and I equate it to someone saying something stupid about minorities only to be followed up with “but he voted for Obama.” Defending a known anti-Semite gives us a large clue about how your own anti-semitism.
"I did and her statements were mostly focussed on the state of Israel and the handling of Palestine, not the Jewish people."
"Equating the two is already antisemitic in my mind, but we can have different viewpoints on that aspect though it's hard to argue that most Jews do not live in Israel."
"It's a pity that any discussion on Palestine is made impossible because those who try will be called an antisemite, even Bernie Sanders has been called that which is mind-blowing."
"There are even laws forbidding criticism of Israel on campus and from government personnel, which is rather alarming from a first amendment perspective."
"I can agree she should be more careful with her words and try to find more common ground with the Jewish community, but labelling any criticism of Israel as antisemitism is deeply concerning."

But ISIS provided a useful foil for the Islamo-leftist alliance, because ISIS was just so over the top cartoonishly evil that it made your regular Islamists and stealth jihadists look moderate by comparison.  "
"This one is trickier for them, since we were told (lied to) by Obama that Iran was moderating, so why was their terrorist in chief in a third country organizing attacks on our embassy?  In order to preserve some semblance of credibility, the more moderate Democrats have to say ""Yes, he was evil, but this was strategically unwise.""  And the Islammunist wing is just straight up outraged since fundamentally they think America brings jihadist terror attacks on itself."

Ole Bernie loved what he saw when he got to take a peak behind the Iron Curtain. And he's an idiot. These dumb fucks have no idea what they're wishing for.
They call our POTUS a russian asset.
The cognitive dissonance on display after Trump just wasted a key asset of a Russian ally is staggering.
YES. Nobody is talking about this!
"They know exactly what they’re wishing for.....free stuff from the government at the expense of wealthy successful people. What they’re too dumb or entitled to see is that the promises of paradise have been disproven throughout history by every government that has tried it. Hell, we are watching the failure of Venezuela in real time."
i know this will sound dumb and stupid but another one of my reasons i want trump to win again  is because i dont think id be able to handle that fucking commie scums accent. That shit is brutal to listen to lol
"They are siding with iran, who best ally seems to be Russia, this is all a plot to secretly pay off the goverment for stealing oil and giving Putin more land,  and power in america as trump will remain in office under his thumb. Geezdo you need racheal and cnn to tell you everything!"
"That's the bottom line, isn't it. I don't know if ""thousands"" is the right number but, the guy had it coming after the embassy attack. Last straw and all that. Its outrageous that these posessed national government leaders, would oppose their own nation like this."
"Man its sad, and childish."
"Im no fan of Soleimani, but there is way more at stake here than just ""taking out a bad guy"". This isnt Bin Laden or Al Baghdadi who were genuinely awful people who were responsible for the death of thousands, but had no affiliation with a sanctioned state. Thats a big deal, you dont murder other countries top military brass unless you want to start something especially when you admit to it! This assassination is extremely reckless in the grand scheme of things and threatens even more American lives just because you wanted to send a statement. That statement, by the way, to Iran is basically ""come at me bro"" and to the the world, the US president is willing to remove or murder foreign leaders on a whim with no process or consultation required, and THAT should be fucking terrifying."
the US president is willing to remove or murder foreign leaders on a whim with no process or consultation required
Maybe they shouldn't BOMB OUR EMBASSY. You talk as if Mr salami was totally innocent and hadn't literally just attacked us.
Right?
SMH
Bottom line: Don't bomb our embassy!  Don't kill Americans!
Especially now that we have a President with cojones who puts Americans FIRST.

I agree with not having troops on the ground. Casual reminder that we are in the year 2020 and we will not be invading Iran on horseback.
Did you see the actual image of the bombed out embassy? You literally read like an Iranian propaganda pamphlet. That's EXACTLY how Iran is spinning this to make it sound awful. You basically sound Iranian...

I am not sure you're aware of the attack on our embassy in 1979. It started the exact same way.
How did it end ? 
Stop it libs.
This is clearly a very different situation separated by about 40 years of history. I’m not sure what kind of comparison you are attempting to make but the killing of one of Iran’s generals would not have been a appropriate response to that crisis either.
This is clearly a very different situation.
"It's the exact same, only separated by 40 years of technology and agression, If Carter did what Trump did and stopped a war by killing a couple of terrorists, he wouldn't have gone down in history the way he did."
I'm just so glad you're not someone who runs ANYTHING in our country.
ahh yes i see you have not done any reading or research into this at all. How typical.
"I’m not aware of any assassination or murder here. We killed enemy combatant on a battlefield, which is what militaries do."
"Wasn't aware that the Baghdad Airport was an open battlefield. Even the Iraqis weren't aware, and that's why they're giving our forces the boot. They see the writing on the wall, and don't want to be host to yet another debilitating conflict."
"This isn't 1850 where troops line up on an open field and wait to get shot at. This is modern warfare, and Soleimani was openly working to attack American lives and property. "
"Also, Iraq isn't exactly giving us the boot. The Iranian-influenced parliament passed a <strong>non-binding</strong> resolution which carries no force of law. To kick us out, they would have to pass a <em>binding</em> resolution with one-year notice before taking effect. It's basically an Iranian PR stunt with no real-world implications."
Wasn't aware that the Baghdad Airport was an open battlefield.
I congratulate you on waking up from the coma you entered in 2002.
Wasn't aware that the Baghdad Airport was an open battlefield.
"We are authorized to use force in Iraq, granted by our Congress and theirs."

We’re seeing who learned from the frenzied push for stupid wars in 2001-03 and who didn’t.
"The folly of those wars was the idea that we could remake the Middle East in our image, either via active nation building (Afghanistan, Iraq) or more passive regime removal (Libya).  I don't think anyone is under that illusion anymore."
"I swear, if 9/11 happened today the modern leftists would feel sorry for the terrorists who flew the planes. They would do anything to spite the orange man."
"The leftists would want to find out which youtube video ""forced"" them to attack the US."
I'm old enough to remember 9/11 and there absolutely were idiots saying that America brought it on herself and that it was Bush's fault.
Not in any large numbers. The fringe has taken over the Democratic Party.
They were probably just responding to gentrification.
OH NO! WHITE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD FULL OF CULTURE AND VALUE! :'(
They'd probably blame it on climate change.

"The scary thing is if, God forbid, something happened to a Republican, these assholes would smirkingly tell us how they brought it on themselves while their supporters danced in the streets."
"So glad my Democrat parents aren't alive to see what the party has become.  But, even my die-hard Demo  Dad  recognized the change and voted for Trump.

John McCain could have been in the WH and done exactly the same thing and the Democrats would still side with Iran.

"I dunno, I'm a Trump supporter but i'm with Rand Paul on this one. Not a fan."
"One man should not be making these decisions that can spark a war, whoever that man is."
Our government was set up specifically to avoid that by congress being the branch that declares war.
"Yes the guy was a d-bag and deserved what he got. But this should have been a case presented to the American people, and we decide through the legislature."
"I understand the concern about having one man with the power to kick off a war, I don’t like that either. The problem is that requiring congress to approve everything our enemies can take advantage of the indecision to do damage just short of forcing congress to act. This has been Iran’s strategy for 40 years."
"We are not at war with Iran, but they have been at war with us since they took over the embassy in ‘79."
"Even if you disagree with the extent of the Executive's current military power, it's a fact that Trump acted well within it, and already has various forms of legal approval for strikes like this through the legislature. I think any constitutional issues come up when we get into massive conflicts without declaring war, not time-sensitive targeted strikes."
Ya know I read into it a bit more after commenting and I'm surprised that it's actually not so black and white as how I viewed it.
"I think you are right that he can take military action without approval, because apparently we have only declared war 5 times in our history, the last being WW2."
So my understanding of it has been a bit off.

If you can’t see that the hit on Sulemani escalated tensions instead of resolving them
I’m going to go out on a limb and say that attacking a US Embassy is what actually escalated them.

"Iran is a big mouth, if u can't figure that out after 40 years of threats, then i don't know what will. The last time this happened in Iran itself it was a disgrace for Carter for not taking prompt action, when Trump takes calcuated immediate action that causes the terrorist to immediately arrest harassing the embassy, now this makes him an asshole and a warmonger. Naaaah bro i think your hate for Trump blinds you and makes u hate America, have some dignity and pride in your country don't follow the treacherous left. Btw, world politics is exactly that of a brawl, but the difference is if your not a pussy of a country you SHOULD retaliate, my America is not a pussy, idk about yours."

or US airstrikes on militia positions last month that caused the protests to start in the first place escalated them
It's almost like there is a huge string if events that led to this. All caused by the US entering the middle East. 
This also could have been stopped if Obama or Trump got us out if the middle East like they promised. We don't need more people dying for no reason

"Yeah, that's why they were attacking us in the 1780s.  Oh wait.  No it wasn't.  <a href=""https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-09-02-0315"">Back then, they thought they had the upper hand, so they told the truth about why</a>:"
"We took the liberty to make some inquiries concerning the Grounds of their pretentions to make war upon Nations who had done them no Injury, and observed that we considered all mankind as our friends who had done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation."
"The Ambassador answered us that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet,1 that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise."
"That it was a law that the first who boarded an Enemy’s Vessell should have one slave, more than his share with the rest, which operated as an incentive to the most desperate Valour and Enterprise, that it was the Practice of their Corsairs to bear down upon a ship, for each sailor to take a dagger in each hand and another in his mouth, and leap on board, which so terrified their Enemies that very few ever stood against them, that he verily believed the Devil assisted his Countrymen, for they were almost always successful."

Not to mention practically funding ISIS through flase flag operations.

I’m sure pretending to care about something else.
So you're perfectly fine with this guy killing people and not doing anything about it if could potentially avoid a larger conflict? Get your head out of your ass-Iran has been a terrorist state for over 40 years. You don't appease terrorists.
"We’re not avoiding a larger conflict, that’s the bullshit war hawks are constantly selling. Yes Iran is a terrorist state. The saudis are also a terrorist state and are in fact the worlds largest terrorist funding organization. Would you like to start assassinating Saudi generals?"
"If Saudi generals actually foment attacks against the US, sure. But they don't. They fund a lot of terrible things, but very little of it is directly meant to attack us. They aren't telling people to attack our contractors or to storm our embassies. That's the difference here."
"Red herring. This guy was responsible for killing many people. Apparently, you're fine with that. I disagree."
We have tons of military leaders responsible for killing thousands and thousands of innocent civilians. Are you prepared to punish them? I’m not saying their intent was the same as the Iranian but the results have been worse. You’re blinded by bias. We’re not always the good guys my friend. Iran could never dream of accomplishing the death and destruction that we’ve achieved in the Middle East over the last 30 years.
"That is different. How can you not see that? Civilian casualties in both Iraq and Afghanistan were the result of collateral. Name a war in which civilians weren't killed. War is an ugly, horrid, non-glorious affair. I'm not saying that I support any of it, because I have never supported the war in Iraq. We should not have ever invaded. I used to support the war in Afghanistan, but I haven't in years. If we're to condemn our military leaders, then you must be fine with punishing Obama as well as Bush, and Trump. All three were/are Commander in Chief. Obama's hands aren't clean of civilian deaths. No president who has ever sat during a time of war has clean hands. "
"Why would you defend a man who has killed many Americans, your countrymen? And if Obama were president and had done this would you be so outraged?"
"Yes, I'm prepared to go after anyone who is a terrorist or supports terrorists. How about you?"

Stupid comment.
There. Will. Be. No. War. 
We don't want war. Iran literally can't go to war against us. There will be no war.
You mean the country that just attacked our embassy?
"You DO realize that Obama attacked 7 sovereign nations, that we were not at war with, and launched (on average) about one un-announced drone strike per day for 8 years.  Do you see HIM as mentally unstable?"
"Is it really that many drone strikes? That's nearly 3,000"
"There is no circumstance under which this could ever lead to a war. Iran has no significant airforce. We control the Strait of Hormuz. Their land armies are insignificant. If they retaliated, we'd bomb them into oblivion and let their enemies finish them off in their own time. WE would never even bother setting troops down in Iran."
"There's being anti-war, and then there's being so pacifistic that you'd let people attack us with impunity."
"Oh cool, you seem well versed in US law and totally don’t listen to CNN."
"was not a Ben Sasse fan, I often thought of him like a RINO, but this quote is good."

Determining your mental capabilities based on your skin color is literally racism.
We’re all green pedes here.
Yeah but the same people will argue you're not really black because you're a conservative.
And those same people will argue that Shawn King and Rachel Dolezal <em>are</em> black.
Trans racial is the crazy people term they use.
"Is that being taken seriously now?  A year ago they were saying that’s offensive, no one can change their race. "
Then people pointed out that black and white are so much more similar than male/female.
I'm not sure what they're taking seriously. I think it just went by the wayside because freaking out about trans issues is the fad now.

Yeah...my dad told me stories when he participated in the student demonstrations in 1989. It’s like listening to veterans talk about their war experiences...

Don't you dare stray off the ideological plantation!
"TLDR; The new progressive ideology is <em>fundamentally based on Identity.</em> It's not a side-result, or the end result of a chain of logic, it's the very core."
"I like the term 'Identity Marxism' to describe the new dominant Progressive ideology. Classical Marxism at it's core proposes that there are two different economic classes, and that the (poor) 'oppressed' class needs to band together and overthrow the (rich) 'oppressor' class."
The new 'Identity Marxism' replaces Economics with two groups of oppressed and oppressor Identities. Progressives themselves call this 'Intersectionality' as in Inter (banding together) Sectionality (different groups).
"As classical Marxists see the world in terms of class struggle, they see the world in terms between groups of Identities. It couldn't possibly be that we want border security because we believe in the importance of Rule of Law and that an open border breeds lawlessness. It has to be identity because their worldview simply cannot fathom any possible reason for things other than Identity."

"I think one could kind of say that the rich white progressive culture would be LGBT culture and the rainbow flag. Intersectionality and Identity Marxism makes them really, really want to be part of an oppressed class. Of course people simply aren't LGBT but that is why they're are inventing 'genders'.  It really becomes just a sort of celebration of any sort of sexual deviance in a more general sense.  This helps explain why it is so important of an issue to progressives that the .001% of people that are transgender be accomodated in their every whim."
"That stuff kind of gets my adrenaline going, all of the ""genders"" and stuff. These far leftists don't even know what basic science is. Gender and sex are the same thing, I think if you're going to say you're something that you're not, it should be called a gender <em>identity</em>, not just gender. Both gender and sex is either male or female. None of it is based on feelings... All of the dems want to show that they're inclusive and tolerant of everybody! Even though they're probably the most intolerant people in the U.S. You say one small thing that goes against their views, and you're the biggest piece of scum on the planet. "

Inter (banding together) Sectionality (different groups).
"Nitpicking, but that's not what the word comes from. Intersectionality is the idea that the individual is the intersection of various identities. A black lesbian Muslim club-footed non-binary immigrant woman is the intersection of various identities based on race, ability, religion, gender, biological sex, and national origin. Intersectionality assigns that person oppression points and places xer on the totem pole accordingly."

"I have more respect for Black conservatives than I do anyone else. The hatred y'all receive, and the actual stereotypes y'all break is unreal. We are blessed to have people like you"
The problem is your biggest opposers are other black people.  If you aren’t thinking the same as other black people you aren’t furthering the interests of all black people. Most white people outside twitter really don’t give a fuck or even know that 95+% of blacks vote democrat.
I know a lot of white liberals who are probably harder on black conservatives than black liberals! The fact that they think they know better than black people themselves seems racist to me.

The irony of being a strong black conservative woman in 2020 and being told you’re a racist or a bigot by a white democrat is amazing. Then again that is racist in and of itself by telling or assuming because a person is a person of color they have to vote a certain way. I’m sorry you went through that my friend.

"It's a marxism thing. See, Marx believed that the world is purely composed of interest groups that act solely for the benefit of the interest group and to undermine contesting interest groups. This is why marxists are so against corporations: they believe corporations act to undermine employees and small businesses exclusively and that doing so always benefits corporations as a whole. Applying this to race, you develop a belief that not only are races always acting to undermine one another (commonly referencing colonialism and slavery, albeit in a single direction of white on black) but that this hierarchy can only be eliminated by swapping the winners and losers (Socialism takes apart corporations in the belief that is benefits the workers, race politics shits on white people in the belief that is benefits black people or constitutes equality). As such, the interest groups must be unanimous in belief, otherwise the premise that there are only interest groups falls apart."
I remember growing up learning that it was illegal or frown upon to tell people who you voted for. And it was a secret. I believe you should vote for the person you believe is the best candidate. And don’t feel bad at who you voted for because it’s your vote not your friends vote. So if they want to vote a certain way that’s fine but they have no business to tell you who to vote for.
Listened to an interesting podcast from  the Hoover institute where they talk about how African Americans are so overwhelmingly democrat that neither party really has to cater to them. Democrats know they have the vote so they don’t have to actually do anything for them while republicans know it’s a lost cause so they also don’t need to do anything to work for their vote.
"Doesn’t matter what color, religion or sex. Vote for who you agree with more."
Feel your pain. As a fellow back conservative I’ve learned (unfortunately) I have to keep it real quiet most of the time. 
At New Years I was a party for my gym. I was outside smoking a cigar in peace when a fellow gym goer leaned to me and was like there’s a trump voter in the party. He started going on and on about one particular guy and honestly I got scared I’d reveal myself too. I was already drinking and I was alone. Not to mention I just feel like there are times and places it’s totally inappropriate to bring up politics. 
I just hate how people assume cause I’m black before even hearing me speak that my views are a specific way. It’s disgusting and offensive.
"I’m sorry you went through that and there is nothing wrong with saying with a big smile on your face “I’m here to have fun man, not talk politics.” I think people who bring political talk at inappropriate times are sad and pathetic individuals who really lack true joy in their lives."
"Anyone telling someone they should act, talk, or vote in a certain way because of their ethnicity is as racist as they come (ie the whole Democrat party) and opinions should be immediately disregarded and they should be distanced from you OP. I’m glad you can see it for what it is."
"No, the fact that we can call you a racist because you hate Mexicans and Muslims alike means you are considered mainstream. Now we know racism isn't circumcized to white poeple, it's widespread among all conservatives."
You know what I hate even more: when conservatives have to literally announce their ethnicity associated to their political views's
I.e
"""Hispanics for Trump""
""Blacks for Trump""
""Women for Trump"""
Why is this only a thing I see on the right? Why does it matter? Why call attention to your ethnicity when you're talking about politics?
"Why isn't it just the ""conservatives party?"""
And this is coming from someone from a political background that specifically highlights identity politics as its key feature? I’ve lost count of how many ethnicities and genders that the Democrats have tried to appease over the most recent election cycle. 
"All I see from the left is this perpetual glorification of identity. So before you point fingers at minority conservatives for pulling the race card (which by the way was directly influenced by the left’s insistent portrayal of us as traitors to progressivism), you should take a look at what your own side has been doing since the turn of the century."
So we can both agree that both aides play identity politics.
"Democrats do so to secure votes (which, btw, has worked). While conservative do so just to ""get at the libs."""
Got it 👍
So your justifying using identity as a weapon to get votes?
Dems got their hands on the identity politics ball first. Conservatives would have definitely done the same thing if the ball was in their court.
Politics is a dirty game.
"Never once seen a Conservative say 'You must be an (insert identity here)' as a debate response. However, 'You must be a white male, southerner' or 'Zionist' (Jew) is very common from Progressives... "
It's very plain that only Progressives who believe that Identity is a valid reason to disregard someone's opinion.
"Just at the Golden Globes, Progressives directly appealed to the 'Self-Interest' of Women as a group, against the interest of Men. "
"Anyways, there's definitely also 'X for Bernie, Biden, etc' groups too, so I'm not really sure where you were going with this. "
Why is there a need for Conservatives to be defensive about it when they don't think Identity is important? Because Progressives control the Media and Culture and have put them under siege. That's what this post was about.
Because the way that the Left plays identity politics is to claim that all minorities are automatically Democrats. Or else they’re race traitors. 
The only way to break that is for those conservatives to stand up and say “No we are not”.
It has to be done to break the hold.
Only democrats are allowed to make fun of things. Obviously Republicans are too simple minded! /s
And yet the celebrities that won had to virtual signal.
"And that's what makes it even more funny. They should have done as he said, but they just can't help themselves."
"Just so disappointing, and with fair warning.  Once again, another actor/celebrity that I really enjoyed before they felt the need to preach to me and everyone else who would listen.  If I never see Patricia Arquette or her ""on full display"" alabaster globes, I'd be totally okay with that.  And sunglasses indoors?  At the Globes?  Get over yourself much?  "
"Yes, I get it, we should all vote.  That's common sense.  Be the change you want to see.  I don't think she's earned the right or respect to be uniquely qualified in either education or life experience to advise me, her seemingly tragic childhood notwithstanding.  ""Tragic"" does not equal ""educated""  or ""informed"" in my world.  She's had limited experience with what most call day-to-day life, so thanks for the advice, but I'll go with my own experience, thank you."
"'Our next presenter starred in Netflix's Bird Box,' Gervais said towards the end, introducing Sandra Bullock."
'A movie where people survive by acting like they don't see a thing. Sort of like working for Harvey Weinstein.'
"As the audience gasped once again in more fake 'what, me?' horror – beautifully proving his point – before booing him, Gervais jeered back: 'You did it, not me…'"
"Okay, the 7 minute opening monologue is great, but we need a full highlight reel featuring all the good stuff he said over the course of the show."
Says Piers Morgan... in the Daily Mail... 
Satire is dead.
Seriously.  Coming from Piers Morgan this is like 11 layers of irony.
Piers has realized the left is batshit insane so he pretends to be moderate now until you mention firearms then he's back to being just like the rest of them.
"They <em>have to</em> virtue signal, not signaling, not finding nazis under every rock, heaven forbid you get found out not calling out the most minor infraction of social justice etiquette that will ruin your career."
"This is what he was ultimately doing; calling them out not to dismantle their PC witch-hunt culture, to call them out for the cred it provides and to shame them into living up to the ideals. He wants them to be far left."
Tucker and Trump are in violent agreement: America does not want another war.

"""Recognizing Poverty Act?""  WTF?  I recognize that we have FAT POOR PEOPLE!!!  There, I fixed it."
"I mean $12,490 is very low but defining poverty is very complicated considering local factors affect it.  To be honest I think this can be defined at the state level but never at the Federal level.  The states should decide how well they will take care of their own."

Ilhan Omar is the byproduct of the wider Islamic-American community. They don’t want to criticize someone from their own ranks by being a Bigot. But all hell apparently breaks loose when we say Islamic Terrorism is a thing. Fucking Hypocrites.
Ilhan Omar is the byproduct of the wider Islamic-American community.  
"It has to be pointed out that of the four Muslims elected to Congress, every single one of them has been a nutbucket anti-Semite with connections to Farrakhan at best and Hamas at worst."
Can you please toss me a source on that? Not disagreeing with you I want to save it for later.
"Keith Ellison was a member of the Nation of Islam who <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/01/politics/kfile-keith-ellison-nation-of-islam/index.html"">defended Farrakhan</a> over a decade after everyone realized what a maniac he is.  "

Omar and Tlaib's anti-Semitism is widely documented but I can give you examples if you'd like.
No those two I knew about thanks though!
"Racism 101 (liberal logic) - if you are white, you're a racist.  If you are not white, you are not a racist."
Izlom is immune to criticism
I think that's just your logic.
Ilhan Omar should be charged with treason.
And bigamy
And immigration fraud.
And ugly
And dumdum
"But she's a Whymin, so she can't be criticized."
"She is one of the spokeswomen for the left now that's why her horrible words are ok or defended by them. Trumps son in-law daugeher and grand children are Jewish. Yet the left call him anti semitic, while Omar boldly makes comments against Jewish people but the Democrats praise her."
This is leftist Standard Operating Procedure: always accuse the opposition of anything wrong you are doing.
"Example: We should have known from day 1 that the moment they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with the Russians to influence the 2016 election, that it was actually Hillary doing it."
"I was about to say this isn't alarming, this is the Left's MO, but then I realized that it absolutely IS alarming that someone THAT far left is in such a high position of power in the United States. The fact that people though it was a good idea to vote for her speaks volumes about the state of ignorance of the people of the United States, and that sends shivers down my spine."
What moron would claim Trump is anti-semitic? His daughter and grandkids are jewish.
"I had a guy seriously argue with me last week that Ben fuckin' Shapiro was an anti-semite. The bar cannot be any lower for them to consider you a bigot, all it takes is any conservative thoughts whatsoever and they'll just make up the rest."
I’m not saying that Trump is an anti-semite...but just because your kid converts to a religion doesn’t mean you can’t have an existing prejudice against that religion. I’ve seen it happen.
"I think putting a bounty on our president is an act of war.  Better ask Crazy Nancy and Schitt first, though, just to be sure."
But she prays for the President!!!/s
Prays for him to lose
Then vote to declare war. Why are we waiting.
Because these fools cannot even agree to pass a budget each year.  No way they will have the courage to go on record for something as controversial as declaring war.  They abrogated their responsibility decades ago.
"And we shouldn't declare war, Trump said he killed Salami to stop a war, not start one."
Agree.  My point is that about all our exalted political leaders can do lately is name Post Offices .  You cannot run or manage military conflict or national security that way.  It's why we have a Commander in Chief in the first plave.
They can't even submit their articles of impeachment lol
All Trump has to do is say refuses to go to war with Iran and anyone who disagrees with him is (insert insult here)
They would fall all over themselves to declare war.
Because the democrats forcibly stall every fucking thing possible.
They should now very dramatically kill the guy who put out the bounty. Same as General Salami.

"Are you gonna gloss over them attacking our embassy? Or shooting down our drone? Or hijacking American/European ships? What about the constant chanting of ""Death to America"", them threatening to attack the US, or breaking the nuclear agreement a dozen times?"
"The dude was considered a terrorist and Iranians are cheering his death on Reddit, he was responsible for hundreds or possibly even thousands of American and Iranian citizens but apparently taking him out is the first thing that's happened out of nowhere!"
"The US Military conducted an assassination mission against a foreign terrorist, we're at war with terror and the organization that man served was on that list."
This foreign terrorist just so happened to be an Iranian general.
​
Name one serving US general that fits any characteristic of him.
"Yeah.  They should get John ""I was in Viet Nam"" Kerry to take their case to the UN."
Remember when Obama gave Iran money?
And now it's being used to put a bounty on a POTUS
Hmmm
What's funny it's only about 1/20 of what obama gave them lol    
Also only cause it's happened joke: quick call kathy griffin she can be funny and important only in iran. Most of us will get this and wish she stay over there.
Remember anti-war protests during his reign?  
"Of course not, they never happened."
"No. I remember when Obama gave Iran their money. And in exchange Iran agreed to not build a nuclear weapon, allow inspectors to ensure they weren't building a nuclear weapon, and the entire international community agreed that the agreement was working."
I also remember Trump tearing up that agreement for no discernible reason.
And yet they continued making nuclear weapons and made a fool of your dear leader
According to who? The IAEA said that Iran was in compliance with the deal. I'll take their word over some random on the internet.
"yeah...no. They were delaying inspectors, hiding stuff before they could get there, same shit they and NK always do."
"Source? Every source I've seen says that the IAEA, the international community and our own IC all agreed that Iran was sticking to the agreement."
"Strange, because everything I've seen says that they thwarted all efforts at inspection, usually delaying them up to 30 days before letting inspectors in and our own intelligence satellites watched them move stuff during those periods."
They also released American prisoners.  These seem like good benefits for giving them their own frozen assets back. 
Considering Trump mocked the deal and touted his own negotiation skills I'd like to see what his tactic is gaining us.

"<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sent-cash-to-iran-as-americans-were-freed-1470181874"">No, not at all</a>"
"What's amazing about this is that the Obama administration ""insisted there was no quid pro quo"", meaning they want us to believe they gave Iran the cash just for the hell of it??? And somehow that's better than using it for ransom? Both are bad but at least one can be said to have good intentions?"
Did you even read the article or just the headline?
"""The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran’s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi."
"<strong>The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague</strong>, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before."""
"We didn't just ""give them money""..."
Edit: I love getting downvoted for quoting the article... Silly facts ruining all the fun!
"Why<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sent-cash-to-iran-as-americans-were-freed-1470181874""> secretly airlift</a> it if it was all on the up and up? Why hide it from congress with the <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hatch-demands-answers-on-the-99-999-99999-payments"">$99,999,999.99 shenanigans</a>?"
"Well a ""unmakred aircraft"" is a completely meaningless term. It's rather common for governments to use plain white aircrafts with nothing but a small tail number on them. Theres nothing nefarious about it. As for keeping the transfer of money hush hush, I'd hope the government would keep a shipment of a billion dollars in cash a secret until after the transfer was complete... It would be rather irresponsible to announce something like that before it happens."
"And is there anything that requires the congress to be informed in the first place? I know they're in charge of the US budget but this would fall under foreign policy which the executive branch has full control over. Just because they were pissed about not getting answered doesn't mean their questions needed to be answered. As for the $99,999,999.99, I couldn't find anything about it other than that its just a weird number. I'd love to know the reason behind it. (I'm going to assume it has something to do on Iran's side of things because if it was on out side it probably would have been found rather quickly.)"
"But at the end of the day, None of the conspiracy theories about the payment hold any water because this wasn't some back room deal with Iran and the US... It was a settlement made in front of an international court. So unless you think the Hague was in on hostage negotiations to sort out the ransom then I don't know what to tell you."
Here's the thing. There's lots of shady shit surround this. You can see it. I can see it.
"You're making tons of excuses, though. That's cool. They're legit excuses. They're still excuses. "
"If it was on the up and up, you wouldn't have to make excuses. Simple. In the same vein, I cannot fucking fathom what Trump meant when he implied the sites he'd attack were important to ""Iranian Culture."" That sounds like he wants to attack UNESCO Heritage sights. I can make excuses for what he may have meant (e.g. they like to hide military bases in children's hospitals), but they'd still be excuses."
Watch how easy this is for me -- Trump was flat out wrong and dumb to say that shit about cultural sites. 
Can you admit Obama's actions on this were weirdly shady and worthy of criticism? 
"As for the $99,999,999.99, I couldn't find anything about it other than that its just a weird number. "
At $100 million he needs congressional approval. So he did <strong>one single penny less</strong> and then did it 13 times.
Again... shady.

What's the conversion rate of Candian moose cock to the US dollar?
80 millions for the head of one of the most powerful persons on earth ? Lol is that all the money they have to spare ?
Probably all that's left over from what Obama gave them
The demand for terrorism has been increasing and they can't afford to keep up with inflation.
"60M of it came from the ICC judgement when the US Navy murdered 290 people, including 66 children on a passenger airliner in Iranian airspace that the US held onto for 30 years until Obama released it to them."
"But of course the US isn't evil for killing almost 300 innocent people and having its ships in the PERSIAN Gulf, right?"
only to have our military being able to find your ass anywhere and send a missile up your ass while their at it.

Why bother? Just take out the Command and Control with another drone. Not like we dont know where he is.
Who knew that the cost to have the US obliterate Iran would be so low?
Hahaha... So are you joining the Marines to kill some rag heads? Don't ever start a war you haven't already won. That's the motto of the US... you should keep it that way. US has more enemy's than true allies this days.

"EDIT: It literally, also states in the article linked, that ""It is not thought the bounty has been backed by government officials."""
It was announced on state tv and wasn’t retracted. You’re kind of splitting hairs.
Anything to be able to defend Iran.
It doesn't change the fact that it wasn't the Iranian government placing the bounty.
No idea why this is downvoted...
Article says that this was a eulogist making a statement about how it could/should be done.
It’s not an official bounty as far as I can tell.

Snopes is a terrible source.
"Highly ignorant of you to think that just because it doesn't support your falsehood that it is ""terrible."""
Snopes bias has been demonstrated on this sub countless times before. It isn’t a credible source any more than far right leaning sites.
Could you please show me where Snopes bias has been demonstrated? Would love to check this out for myself.
"I'm not in a place to take time to search but I'll give you one instance off the top of my head.  There was a statement that democrats tried to impeach every ELECTED Republican President since Eisenhower in the 60s.  There have been six Republican presidents since then,  the only one who the democrats never introduced articles of impeachment for was Gerald Ford, Snopes rated that statement as ""mostly false "" when in fact it is 100% true.  5 out of 5 elected republicans had impeachment  articles against them.  Even if the statement didn't say ""elected"", then it would be 5 out of 6 presidents, which a non biased fact checker would probably rate as ""mostly true""."
"ere have been six Republican presidents since then,  the only one who the democrats never introduced articles of impeachment for was Gerald Ford, Sno"
"<a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-impeach-gop-presidents/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-impeach-gop-presidents/</a> "
"I'm assuming you're referring to this. It says nothing about elected presidents, just presidents."
"The title of the article is ""The Democratic party has tried to impeach <strong><em>every</em></strong> Republican president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. """
The definition of every is 
"""used to refer to all the individual members of a set <strong><em>without exception."",</em></strong> emphasis on the without exception part. So yes, this is mostly false, as there is an exception."
"The conservative talking point has and always has been that every ELECTED republican president since Eisenhower... Snopes takes that claim, REWORDS it as it sees fit and rules it as mostly false to discredit the actual talking point which is 100% true. If you can't see the bias in that then you are part of the problem. Especially given the second half of your statement.  The claim could easily have been rated as mostly true and it would have not received as much disdain for impartiality but it would also not discredit the talking point which is what Snopes intended to do. Honestly it's not a secret at all that Snopes is incredibly left-leaning, you have to be insanely brainwashed to believe it is a neutral fact-checking site."
"Snopes donates the maximum possible to democrats and only democrats. They slant their stories to the left, it is known, they are not a legitimate source for anything"
It's kinda weird how snopes can spend 10 minutes telling you why something is basically accurate and then labels it false.
That shows you really don't get it. Dunning Kruger.
"I get that snopes is the biggest joke of a fact-checker possible. Their members are known liberals. Their bias is incredibly obvious. They literally fact-check the Babylon Bee, which is a satire site."
What do you see there that's false?
Why that specific number?
It implies that every person in the US should put up a dollar.
"Na, at this rate the Iranians might do it for free."
"Next time Iran does a military parade, you can just see it as a target-rich environment."
"Just like all the US troops in the ME, being used as bait by these DC psychopaths, right? "
"The same DC psychopaths that didn't sign up for military service, nor served.."
Its many US targets to take out in the ME...
LOL...hell the next Lotto Max here in Canuckland is $70 million.
This guy...what a nut. 
OK well...since we can see a tattoo on a rat's ass with our satellites and surveillance...I mean...
Democrats have been trying to do it for free. They have been missing a cash cow.
Well I guess silver lining is if it works out for them we’ll get some of the money back that Obama gave them.
"You mean the $61.3M that the ICC has ordered the US Navy to pay Iran for shooting down 290 people on a passenger airliner, IN Iranian airspace, including 66 children that they refused to pay until Obama released it to them?"
"No I mean the hundreds of billions in cash on pallets, so really the $80M is a drop in the bucket. Don't worry though, the US is totally the bad guy and the sole reason the middle east is a hellscape"
326 million. Put me in coach.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
"Man, that's like a mandalorian level bounty. I see this becoming a video game."

How much does one of our drones with a combat payload cost? Probably more I am guessing
"The old predator drones were apparently 4 million each before payload. However The ""reaper"" class drone that took out Soleimani is roughly $64 million before payload, and is the same drone that was shot down by Iran years prior."
"Nope, remove his military power and let Iran rise up and lynch his butt. Do not make him a martyr or a rallying point, just make it impossible for him to continue to rule and for his army to function."
"if I'm not mistaken the population hates their rulers and would love to be a free country again. I'm not saying invade, I'm saying that it may not be a rallying cry for them"
"Exactly, I know a number of Iranian exiles who would love to return to rebuild a modern Iran, once the Mullahs were gone."
She's spot on and gorgeous
I'm disgusted that Trump has not taken action on this. The UN forces Americans to take in these foreigners who would otherwise be illegal.
About time.
"Not really. They should have a trial in the senate (for multiple reasons), but Pelosi doesn't want to give them that (for the same reasons). IF they dismiss without a trial they give her a win."
"There's only a couple of days left for her to officially submit, and then they can move forward with the Senate dismissal, correct?"
"I agree with the proposed rule changes, but what are the chances that the 3 main RINO's in the Senate will toe the party line? Romney, Collins and Murkowski could definitely vote against. Repubs need simple majority to dismiss, and the RINO's could turn the tide."
"Pence would break a tie, and he wouldn't go against Trump."
Great point. I forgot that he is President of the Senate.
"It’s the right move for the Senate, but it’s also what Pelosi wants.  There’s 3 paths for her:"
"Send the articles over and Trump is acquitted.  Democrats can talk about how the Republicans didn’t hold a fair trial, but Trump can still say he was acquitted.  Dems don’t want that.  This is a loss for the Dems and win for Republicans.  I’ll be shocked if this happens. "
"Hold the articles indefinitely, in hopes that the Senate flips on Election Day.  The problem with this is that the longer she holds the articles the worse it looks on her, even with the Dems claiming it’s because of trying to get a fair trial.  People will grow weary of the games, and will tire of the oh so urgent articles of impeachment that weren’t urgent enough to actually send to the Senate.  The risk for the Republicans, though, is that it allows for the continual media and Dem outrage machine to keep rolling, which may or may not move the needle if they find a narrative to catch steam.  It’s a small risk, but in politics anything can happen.  This is a likely loss for Dems, with a very small chance to turn on the Republicans.  Personally, I’d like to see the Republicans call her bluff and keep the attention on her games, but that’s just me. "
"Hold the articles and the Senate dismisses the charges.  Dems will claim that the Republicans didn’t want to hold a fair trial, and Republicans will say that the Dems didn’t have a strong enough case to send the articles over.  We all saw the farce of an inquiry from the Dems, and Trump’s actions aren’t impeachable, but the media and Dems will beat the “Republicans didn’t want to hold a fair trial, so they refused to have one”.  The needle doesn’t move at all in this scenario.  It’s pretty much a draw, which is the best the Dems can hope for in all of this.  "
"Just my opinion, fwiw"
"Hold the articles indefinitely, in hopes that the Senate flips on Election Day."
"How would this work? If the session ends all unfinished congressional business ends, effectively voted down or vetoed. Impeachment would have to start <em>all over again</em>"
"You forgot option number 4, and it's the most realistic one:"
"4)Sending the articles, eventually, and the senate holds a fullblown trial, bringing in heaps of exculpatory evidence strategically withheld during the house proceedings. The house proceedings already made a pretty weak case, but by putting either Mulvaney or Pompeo on the stand, the republicans can convincingly clear Trump of all wrongdoing and score a major blow against the democrats."
​
"In essence, Schiff has tricked Pelosi into a lose-lose situation, by pubilicly sketching a narrative he didn't have an ounce of supporting evidence for. Pelosi could then either call him a liar (someone of her own party, unlikely) or start the impeachment proceedings Schiff was after. If Pelosi follows protocol, democrats are going to lose seats in the house as independents see it for what it is when the senate provides a fair trial."
"Should she hold until after the election and should the senate flip (I don’t believe this likely) Republicans should move to dismissed the articles. Not sure whether Chief Justice Roberts would agree to it (He cares far too much about his own image for a CJ), but it would absolutely be the proper move."
The whole thing is such horrible fiction. The house impeached. The gavel came down. The votes were taken and entered. The articles aren't even a legal formality to be sent. They don't even require physical copies or an actual runner to send them to the senate. There's no provision in the Constitution for the Speaker to hold the articles. They are de facto legal prima fascia proceedings that automatically move to the Senate. The rest of this bullshit is fuckery.

What the fuck there needs to be mandatory voter ID and voter purges every 2 years.

I want to assume these are people that passed away but the figure is staggering and ripe for fraud.
"they where letting people in california register the day of voting with nothing more than proof of residency that's it, note proof of residency is not proof of citizenship."
"So, when they say voter turn out is 50% in some states/counties, that might actually be closer to the true count of voters?"
But CNN told me that voter fraud never happens.
"That’s the funny part, show me a single sport, contest, bet, or any other competition—and You’ll find a cheater there. BUT when it comes to elections— where power, and money are the end goal....well no one cheats that. How very racist of you to insinuate otherwise."

"Nothing stirs liberal hearts like death, mayhem, chaos and evil...."
"How can she be serious? Imagine feeling bad for people who literally want to kill your country's people  and are supporters of an animal who killed 600+ americans?!?! These creatures she's ""moved by"" would murder her instantly if given the chance because of her nationality/religion. Outrageous."
"Stuff like this is why the left are going to get trounced in Nov. Worse than Labour lost in the UK. The people are sick of their insane, anti-American, pro terrorism rhetoric"
Why is she wearing that head covering?
"Oh yeah, because if she doesn't, she'll be beaten and probably raped."
This is just yet another case of Trump talking too much. The US military would obviously never target cultural sites.
Do you think the things he says reflect who he is as a person?
"Yeah - I am pro Trump but we need more clarification.   If they are hiding nuclear activities at sites, then so be it, but Churches/Mosques and historic sites being bombed/blown up is purely an ISIS thing and even Iran killed those fuckers."
"Agreed.  Targeting or threatening to target civilian sites, which is what historical/cultural sites are, is terrorism.  Threaten military sites, nuclear sites, heck even police stations, government buildings, and electricity/telecom as those are all legitimate military targets."

"The country is deeply entrenched in enormous poverty and violence. People leaving and requesting asylum from a country with sky rocketed murder rates and mass corruption shouldn’t be a shocking issue. 
I think it might’ve been mistaken. The asylum seekers would have to be sent back to their country of origin but the Mexican State has agreed or somewhat, to take in asylum seekers from Guatemala"
"I can see what Tucker is saying about all the post-strike justification but were we going to let our embassy go unaddressed? After all Trump’s ire over Benghazi? I don’t think so. What the hell was an Iranian general doing in Iraq, walking around like he owns the place? I can tell you but you already know the answer. The real question is: why didn’t Soleimani get eliminated earlier?"
"Lots of good points. I didn’t get a chance to read the full article, but caught some of his monologue. I wonder what he would have done in Trump’s shoes."

This right here.

Most of Reddit fucking loved his monologue bro idk what you’re talking about
Most of reddit aren't rabid leftists still crying that Hillary lost. They tend to stick to the main political subs because elsewhere people are sick of their shit.
"I kind of agree. Although from my personal observation, I’d say roughly 80% of Reddit leans left. A large portion of them are also unwilling to acknowledge any good thing orange man has ever done in his entire life."
"I mean, yeah probably. I lean left in most things. But there's a difference between a liberal and a leftist. The further to one side of a quadrant you go the more insane you need to be. "
"I think it's safe to assume most of reddit users are centre left. Places like <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> are hard authoritarian left."
"Ricky's speech was great and needed to be heard, but he's not someone conservatives need to champion. He's still very much a liberal in a lot of ways and is strongly anti-2A."
"My God, that is just perfect. I can see them all clutching their pearls. Hollywood is a cesspool of hypocrisy and perversion. They certainly needed to be brought down a peg."
There is no host yet for the Oscars this year. Please let it be Ricky G. Don't I wish.

Was this the guy who played Dominic Badguy in that one Muppets movie?
"Anyway, I totally agree with what he said."
"Just so I'm sure, you're saying the world shouldn't listen to film and tv celebrities?"
Clint Eastwood yelling at a chair?
Charlton Heston?
Ronald Reagan?
Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Donald J Trump?
"Legitimately, is there some threshold of seriousness?  What are the qualifications?"
Wasn't Charlton Heston the head of the NRA for a while? Didn't Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump become president? Weren't Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan both governor of California?
If the argument is that we shouldn't care what celebrities think...
"But sometimes we should take them seriously enough to elect them to major office, or cheer while they yell at a chair..."
Then how does one transition from merely a celebrity who should be silent and one that we should pay attention to?
What's the difference?
Obviously they rise to the level of being taken seriously.
How is that different from any normal person?
Because I guess your average Hollywood person is a whining sniveling little bitch.
"Isn't the argument then that whining, sniveling little bitches shouldn't voice their opinion?"
"But some celebrities aren't that, right?"
Anyone can voice their opinion... doesn't mean that I have to listen to them or take them seriously.
But it is fun to laugh at and mock them.
"Right, like if the users in a supposedly intellectual sub claim their rationale is one thing, but that makes them hypocrites, so then they immediately abandon that rationale without admitting they were wrong in the first place, and then it just devolves to school yard name calling and no one bats an eye, they just throw insults and downvotes?"
Something like that?
"I agree, it's fun to laugh at them and mock them."
Anyone can voice their opinion... doesn't mean that I have to listen to them or take them seriously.
"I absolutely agree with that part, though."
"Not sure anyone claimed this was an ""intellectual sub."" It's more a place to chill out and run into a few triggered troll tards in the process."
"reagan and trump were/are president, so one would think they should be knowledgeable when it comes to politics"
*Should* being the operative part of that statement.
"But when did they transition from ""just"" actors, to ""serious""?  Clearly it was some time before the inauguration.  Presumably before their parties nominated them, too."
Any idea when they might have crossed the threshold?
Isn't it just...  If you listen to them and they sound serious and make sense to you?
And I absolutely acknowledge that you may think I listen to ridiculous people.  But I probably think the same of you.  Right?
"My point being, it's not some inherent attribute of the person that's lacking."
"Ie, this post (and Ricky's statement) is just an ad hominem attack that should be taken no more seriously than the opinions of the people it is attacking."
How can you call a billionaire and millionaires democrats lmao
"Almost every actor is Democrat, as well as some of the richest people in the world like Warren Buffett. To say that rich people can't be Democrats is bullshit because there are just as many rich Democrats as Republicans. Furthermore, there are many less wealthy people who are Republicans so saying that Republicans are the party of the rich is a lie, we just don't believe in people being dependent on the government."
Huh?

"Why are you listing both TERF and Nazi? That's kind of redundant. If you cannot accept a woman with a penis, you might as well be Hitler."
"That’s what I mean. When I say getting surgery to remove your penis doesn’t actually make you a woman, that it’s got to do with biology and our chromosomes, I get called that stuff. And the fact that there are two genders, although in nature and humans there have been transvestites and anomalies - but not some new shit entirely it still means there are two genders basically . And that women should be wary of the trends these days, we should accept our biology and stick to our instincts as we experience causal sex differently than men so we should not whore around like society tells us in order to be “liberated.” That is what the “feminist” in me thinks, it’s not “radical” at all this is common sense. I’d say these are all valid opinions backed by science and I’m not advocating for anyone’s rights to be taken away?? If i don’t want to associate trans women as women like I am, (because we just have abilities that men don’t AND vice versa) then I am a radical feminist? 
Sorry for the novel. I just feel I can’t talk about this to people anymore. I hardly participate but hang out in this sub to read some rational discussions."

Who is sitting next to that douchebag DeNiro?
Are you talking about Scorsese? That dude's the best in the business.

I seriously doubt there are homeless people urinating at the gate of an airport.

"Heres what i think: omar, if given absolute power, would have no gripe with her soldiers mowing down crowds of wrongthinkers.  Thats why she is fine with Iran."
But it's really ironic....she would be one of the first to be executed by the regime.  She is just an ignorant stooge spewing the bullshit of the leftist elites.  Once they have total control they won't need her anymore.  In fact they won't allow any douchebag big mouths like her to hang around.
Did you believe this article?!
"""Killing a terrorist makes you a terrorist"""
"""If you live in a house you're racist"""
"""Its not fair that you work hard and have more money while high school drop outs are homeless"""
I'm just starting to make a list on these stupid quotes
<strong>let me get this straight</strong>
"We killed someone actively working to kill Americans, and we have a US Congresswoman calling us terrorists for it? Omar, you’ve got a lot to learn if you think you’re fooling anyone but your TDS and Muslim terrorist followers."
Dumb cunt
"Wow, I wonder if everything you believe about her is actually fake news and satire?"
I know this is satire. But some of the real news isn’t that far off
It’s way far off. Has Omar ever defended this man or called him peace-loving? 
I’m fine with the satire but people here are confusing reality and satire.  They’re clearly not informed if they can so easily be tricked.
"For one, her tweet about how we should not defend Trump-related assets overseas, saying it’d be wrong of Trump to use American resources to protect against threats to, say, his Hotel chains."
"But that’s an American asset that may involve American employees and residents. Same as attacking an embassy. She has acted as if soleimani’s death is a tragedy. And she has pointed to the (propaganda) funeral photo op to show how important he was to them. But I’m guessing half the people there were forced to be there at gun point. <a href=""https://twitter.com/AzherRubaie/status/1213758406307328001/video/1"" rel=""nofollow"">This</a> is what happened to those who didn’t partake."
"Trust me, I’m informed. But considering her behavior, this satire <em>isnt</em> far off"
"Can you point m e to articles that would describe her “acting as his death is a tragedy?”  I’d like to understand what you mean by that.  Her position seems no different from other democrats, experts on Iran, and our allies around the world.   They aren’t saying the man didn’t need or deserve to die, they are saying there is no clear strategy to prevent this causing more violence, and Congress wasn’t involved.  The president just assassinated a very important person, unilaterally, and the whole world, not just Omar, are calling it out as a bad move.  "
"I’m also unfamiliar with what she has said about Trump’s assets overseas (goggles it, found nothing,)."
Check her Twitter. That’s all the proof you need. She even asked a judge to go easy when prosecuting ISIS members
"I have - have you?  I notice you’re not quoting her Twitter because there is nothing there that backs up what you are saying.  Omar has made the same criticism of the President‘ s unilateral, dangerous, unplanned act of war that everyone else is, but she is being smeared with fake news and accused of supporting the evil man that was assassinated.  "
Which ISIS members did she ask a judge to go easy on?   Sounds like you got the fake news version of that story as well.
"<a href=""https://twitter.com/Ilhan/status/1196847767764815872?s=20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/Ilhan/status/1196847767764815872?s=20</a>"
This is in reference to an ISIS member. The only fake news is anything saying she has America’s best interests at heart. Don’t call me a bullshitter in the same breath you ask for a source—just in case I send that source and make you look like a fool
"There you go - it’s ONE person, for whom she asked for a lighter sentence than 30 years.  But you and the fake news said it was more than one person.  What in the letter exactly do you disagree with?    "
"I’m at a loss as to how you think that this source backs up your claim, it shows that your claim was hyperbole!"
"Imagine if a foreign government found a serial killer living in America, and killed them by blowing up his car on the highway with a guided missile, harming nobody else. Would you not call them terrorists?"
"Well you changed your example a bit to fit your narrative. A more accurate comparison would be if one of our generals carried out hundreds of unwarranted plans to attack another country’s citizens and troops, and actively executed American citizens. Moreover, that attack wouldn’t happen on an American highway but at an airport of a different country that general had no business being in anyway. If another country killed him in order to stop future attacks on themselves I wouldn’t call that terrorism. But hey-believe what you want"
"Just know that the country you are currently defending while calling us terrorists has opened fire on its own citizens for not participating in soleimani’s funeral. 
You might want to rethink your argument

"Thanks for this. I noticed I had a left-leaning media bias, so I've started reading more conservative-minded media to get a better understanding of the whole picture. It's interesting how much the information differs on each side, how each worldview seems so internally-coherent when seen through their own perspective, and how twisted and misguided each worldview seems from the opposite perspective. I don't know what to make of this, but I'm happy to learn more about this worldview. There has to be something of value in it also."
I applaud your ability to see both sides. It’s very hard to stay open minded these days and there is bias everywhere you look. Stay vigilant and mind your sources. It’s a crazy world out there. It takes a lot of maturity to say what you just said and I consider to a true American for it regardless of your political affiliation. God bless
WTF is this... opposite day?!
When democrats are so out of touch with reality that the average reader can't spot the satire any more.
"The average reader would have known by the third sentence that was satire, it’s blatant.  The “journalist” referred to Soleimani as a “peace-loving mass-murderer.”"
And we have a current serving member in the House who thinks it's possible for a man-made structure to capsize an island.
Babylon Bee is filling the “It could be true” satire niche left over by The Daily Currant quite nicely 
And now I miss The Daily Currant again...
Is it opposite day?
"2020 - The first time ""Peaceful"" and ""Iran"" get used in the same sentence"
i’m sure she is proud of that.
This horrible person should not hold any office in this country. The people who voted for her should be ashamed of themselves ( if even possible) but she needs to be voted out quick. She hates America yet she holds one of our highest offices and still  hates our people.
"WTF?  Kick this seditious b!tch out of congress, she's a muslim propagandist."
Look at how many people here believed this!  How many other fake stories about Omar have y’all believed?   You’ve created a persona who doesn’t even exist.
You’ve created a persona who doesn’t even exist.
Wrong.  The lunacy of left is so great that something even mildly satirical is believed because there is no lie they will not tell....and they do it without shame.
"Are you saying people thought the journalist was a leftist?  Or conservative?  You thought that any journalist would refer to a “peace-loving mass murderer?”   It’s intentionally contradictory,  making it obvious that it’s satire.  The writing is shoddy and overly simplistic.  And the fact that people believed it meant that they didn’t verify the source."
Someone tell Omar to do it first telling Americans where their loyalty is.
Had to double check for satire flair
A society can't be so open that they let their enemies set up shop. We do indeed need some standards.
Surely there's some legal boundary she's crossing if that comment is real....
"At heart, leftists generally don’t care in the slightest about veterans. They only claim to care when they can use them as a tool to advance whatever agenda they’re pushing that day."
We need more of these guys speaking up. Liberal media are going as far as calling this guy a hero.
Liberals are even editing his Wikipedia page to make it seem like Trump killed a great guy.
Disgusting.
"Okaaay, Soleimani <strong>may</strong> have been a terrorist responsible for the <strong>deaths of hundreds of Americans</strong>... but Michael Moore told me I had never heard of him!"
"And if Michael Moore says it, that means he was probably a good guy, he might even have been an austere religious scholar or something!"
Then he should reenlist. /s
Is that the guy who had that gun myth show?
Of course the Army did. Soleimani's Al Quds force killed nearly every fifth US serviceman who died in Iraq.

"I didn’t ask if the statement was true but if we could ever have our flags half mast for somebody who is not a citizen. That’s why I didn’t name the person listed in the article, I asked a question in regards to flag etiquette."
Forgive me for misunderstanding your question.  Perhaps you may find it more enjoyable to research the topic on your own.
I feel like when allied heads of state have passed away we've done half mast before but I could be wrong.
"Now I want to know too. Churchill, Gandhi, Thatcher... probably would've been good candidates if lowering them for a foreign national is a thing."

There's a list in the article you linked to.
Cool...I hadn't gotten the chance to go back and actually read it yet.
OMG now freaking sad and telling is it that I literally thought this was true until I saw the source.
"Is this true? Because if so that is crazy, why would AMERICANS mourn the death of a man that killed thousands of Americans."
"Edit: just looked at source, obviously fake."

my family was watching the football game before it and were too lazy to change it after it changed to the golden globe so we saw his opening speech.  all our jaws were on the floor when he was just going after them with attack after attack.  we were cracking up the most when the hollywood elites sat there in silence after his jokes at them.

That genuinely made me laugh out loud
"*thank your god, he's a hard atheist."
He’s made that very clear too
"Oh, man, does he ever. ""Militant"" atheism is the term I used to use. When I was new to reddit, the default group of subs included <a href=""/r/atheism"">/r/atheism</a> and I swear he was on the top of that sucker 2-3 times a day. They still allowed memes at the time, or some other image format that is no longer allowed, but man, seeing his face that often probably drove me to unsub. He was MEAN."
"I am all for believing in what you want to believe. But I had a similar experience. I'm an atheist myself and i don't actively go and try to debunk and shame religious folk. If anything i was relieved I didnt have to worry. But when i was knew to reddit i subscribed to atheism and i was shocked. ""Militant atheism"" is the best way to explain it. All the stuff they complain about other religious groups doing they kind of do."
"Any time you have a subreddit that’s about NOT believing in something, all they’re gonna do is trash people w opposing views. Everybody should have a space where they can talk about beliefs but the atheism sub blocks anybody that’s religious so it’s just a big neck beard, echo chamber of superiority"
"He's a fedorable little tosser, but I'll give him this, he supports liberty."
"He knows many of these actors are so called ""Christians""."
"Never heard <em>that</em> before.  Calling yourself a Christian, in Hollywood, is damn near Epsteining your own career...or at least your major box office gigs..."
Wait did he actually say this
You bet your sweet ass.
Thank the lord yes he did.
"they bleeped out the ""fuck off"" part, but yes.  it's on video linked much farther down their page."
So spot on and hysterical.
Wow.   I love this speech.
He really despises that crowd... god bless him
I guess he is tired of doing these shows.
"He said ""Thank Your God"". He doesn't care which God they thank, he's an atheist. "
Dont miss quote him.
"The nervous laughter during the whole thing was great too, but this quote was my favorite."
"I love how Comedians are finally stepping out again and challenging the status quo.  Comedy is suppose to be edgy, even uncomfortable."
Comedy is supposed to point out the stupid in everyday life that everyone is just accepting.
"Exactly. The people that just accept everything hate it, and that's fine by me. I point out stupid things people blindly accept every day, and it's not popular. They blindly defend it without any good reason."
"Like why we find it SO important to say ""bless you"" when you sneeze. I'm religious, and I think it's one of the dumbest traditions around. The lady I worked next to would get so offended if there was silence after she sneezed, but she's said multiple times she's not religious. I mean, I guess ""Bless You"" isn't strictly a religious term, so maybe I'm wrong."
"It’s just a colloquialism at this point, you don’t have to overthink everything lol"
"I think saying, ""bless you"" is just being courteous and nowadays letting someone like a stranger known that there still are caring and polite people in the world. Just like saying, ""excuse me"" when you're in someone's way even if it's like both of you reaching to open the door."
"I just went to a wedding, the fight on dumb traditions was on"
I say “salud”
"I don't know about bless you, but the German phrase we all know and I won't attempt to massacre the spelling of, in old germanic ment something like ""I hope your soul stays in your body"""
"Nope, Comedy is supposed to mock Trump. Orange man bad.. Republicans bad... Vote blue /s"
"Him, Chappelle, and Burr are all shining examples of this rn."
"Louis CK too. They are all Liberals, but they are finally at least calling out the bullshit on their own side."
[deleted]
Same with Bill Burr.
Plus Bill will never be able to be called racist because he married a very nice woman who happens to be outside his race.
You know he's definitely been called racist before and bill fucking unloaded on that person
"Oh, that's not gonna stop anyone"

I fall into and helped to boost the first part of the  category 😂
Or that French actor Juicy Smooyay. Nobody is safe with Dave cuz he sees the humor in everything
[deleted]
Nor should anyone - get over it - if you can't laugh about yourself you are too serious and should just exit stage left.
"bruh, he's french, which means he's all about the wine.  it's juicy sommelier."
The other thing is stuff like Black Bush were freaking hilarious! Not the vitriol and invective of most comedians today
Word - I don't ge offended.  heck I am an Irish Catholic - any jokes about being a drunk - Nah never heard one.
Plus people seem to.forget. we might have different political views in America. But we all are on the same fucking team! Joking about eachother should bring us closer
M A R S Mars bitches.
"I should preface this by saying I am Liberal (just enjoying reading people’s thoughts on Ricky’s Golden Globes monologue), but this is something you don’t get with Liberals."
"You will never see someone in a left-leaning sub say “Oh this guy is a conservative but I still enjoy and respect his work because...”. It just doesn’t happen. We’ve all unanimously decided for some reason that if you’re conservative, we have to hate you and everything you do, and it fucking sucks. "
"So over the past few years, I’ve developed the eccentricity of being staunch Liberal in my views, but mainly enjoying socialising with Conservatives."
It is what it is I guess.
It's no fun to be hanging out with zealots
"That is admirable. People need to realize that at the end of the day we all want the same core things, a happy and prosperous life for as many people as possible, we just disagree on what should be done to achieve that goal."
I said that to a liberal at work who was adamant that conservatives do not want that. I was dumbfounded.
The idiots on both sides are so loud that it’s quite easy to forget that the other is not just a stereotype who wants what you define as chaos. 
It’s sad how we forget that others are human because we have a label to slap on them.
I'm pretty center. Maybe a tad to the right. And you just summed things up well for me.
"I cant stand the liberal parts of reddit because they are WAAAYYYY too far up their own asses. It's hard to have a open discussion because they immediately hit me with ""muh enlightened centrist"" meme. "
"I never get that with conservatives. It's all pretty down to earth and at the end of the day good discussions can be had without the snarky ""yeah ummm no you're wrong sweaty"" pretentiousness."
That's the difference between having ideas and holding an ideology. 
"An ideology relies on beliefs but comes at you as a package: you have to hold beliefs A B and C but also have to hold onto D E F because those allegedly follow from ABC. Whereas a thinking person can hold onto A,C, and F as well as others at the same time."
"And they should even understand that A and C might be good in one context, but terrible in another."
Context? You mean being a racist!
"Yeah, ideology doesn't do nuance."
<em>one of us.  one of us.  one of us.  one of us.  one of us.</em>

"Most of my friends are liberals and it's actually kind of funny to me. They won't touch anything remotely conservative. But if I want to watch or listen to anything, I know it's going to be made by liberals. So I just learned to suck it up and deal with it.  My friends will happily shit on anything conservative in front of me. But the moment I disagree with anything they've said. They'll physically shake with anger. I have one friend who wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks because I told him I didn't think churches should lose tax exemption if they talk about something like abortion."
I have one friend who wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks because I told him I didn't think churches should lose tax exemption if they talk about something like abortion.
"He must not understand the tax code. They can talk about any social issue they want, they just can't advocate for specific candidates."
"Well we weren't arguing about what the law is, but rather what it should be. He held the Beto O'Rourke view. I feel completely the opposite. Nobody attends a church under compulsion, nor are they supported in any significant way by public funds (I've talked to liberals who think that they are funded like schools)thus I feel they should be able to espouse any political or non political views they want. I used my work as an example, which is a non profit funded by medicaid, and actively advocates for local candidates that support increasing that funding, which gives them even more money. I actually had to fight with my boss who wanted us to attend a rally, instead of our weekly manager's meeting, which was at the state house since it's contrary to my views(it's a nuanced issue for me)."
Sorry for lengthy comment. But my point is this friend can't handle any viewpoint that opposes his own. I was respectful toward him. But attacked his views.
And Andrew Schulz!
That dude will blow up soon. A very funny human.
"Have you listen to Ricky from back in the day? Check out his Opie and Anthony bits, they’re gold"
Bill Burrs 'philly rant
You are not kidding - he goes off.  Thanks for the tip.
That room was the very definition of uncomfortable.
"Great point- and brings to mind the recent Seinfeld quote (to some degree echoed by other comics) that touring college campuses is nearly impossible, lest the students become hopelessly triggered by free speech."
"That's because comedians are tired of being silenced. All the far left, emotions matter more than facts, everyone needs to be offended culture, goes against everything stand up comdey is about."
I think Kevin Hart getting publicly dumped from the Oscars was a big warning to many comics that anyone can be silenced.
"so many comedians have all said the same thing... they can't make any jokes that might offend anyone, especially not jokes about literally anyone who isn't a straight white christian male."
"seinfeld, bob saget, louis ck, and many more have all said it.  comedians used to be big on the college campus circuit, but now most colleges don't host comedians at all.  the kids are so woke that they demand coddling of their snowflake emotions and they will throw hysterical tantrums, heckling the comedian directly, or harassing them after/online.  when comedians supplicate to this hysteria, it's just not funny anymore, so the rest of the audience leaves.  then because the woke are a very loud but tiny minority, they're not enough to support a show from just their numbers."
"most people don't realize... progressives aren't even half of all historically leftist voters.  not even close.  they're just loud and hysterical.  before thinkprogress went under, they commissioned a bunch of surveys and polls, and found progressives are only ~6% of the population.  supplicating to snowflake hysteria is the fucking worst thing that could have been done, and it shows... trump is literally filling stadiums with lines and crowds of thousands of people outside.  meanwhile, none of these progressive dem candidates can even fill a grade school gym.  there are more people on line to use the bathroom at trump's rally during the peak of his speech than total attendance at any dems' event.  "
everyone needs to stop supplicating to hysterical snowflakes.
"I’m Liberal but this “woke” minority just fucking suck. When I attended university, I just could not deal with the PC culture, it was stifling and so inauthentic that I felt like I was marooned on an island with a bunch of aliens. But most people were not like that, it’s a vocal minority. "
"The vast majority of other Liberal’s I’ve ever met have just been normal people who laugh at offensive jokes and think PC culture is bullshit. But now if I identify myself as Liberal, people immediately assume I’m that “triggered” stereotype, because they are so damn loud and the majority of us don’t give enough of a shit to speak up."
"So these days, most of my friends are either conservative or very covertly liberal."
"Leftists are not liberals, Liberals and Conservatives both generally have the same goals for the country but disagree on how to get there. "
"Leftists(in america) are the woke Socialists who think America is a no good evil bad place, want to silent all opposing viewpoints, display PTSD symptoms when a conservative speaker comes to speak on a college campus, and show more respect to terrorists in the middle east who kill innocent men, women, and children over there, oppressive dictators who uses chemical weapons on their own citizens, Show more respect to MS 13 one of the most violent gangs in the world whose motto is ""Kill,rape, control"", than Americans."
"I don't even know what it means to be a Liberal.  I am classic liberal, I believe in individual rights over that of the state, I believe everyone is equal and should be judged by what they do, not color or religion, or sexuality.  I also believe in gun rights, law enforcement, the right to keep your own money and the right to say whatever you want.  Now, does that make me a conservative?  But most conservatives believe all those things too.  I am a fiscal conservative and a libertarian too.   We are all mixed up and vote based on varying issues, but I just don't know what these labels even mean anymore.  It is so confusing."
"it doesn't have to be this aggro normally, but these people are literally hopping their private jets to go rape children, followed by glam red carpets, and lecturing us about environment and politics, and they deserve to be mocked relentlessly."
Not really. Its supposed to be funny. Ricky is damn funny.
"That wasn’t comedy though, that was just the truth, but the fact that it had to be said, is funny."
"The fact that it had to be said, is the least funny thing about it."
That wasn’t comedy though
Sure it was. Comedy has always been about truth and calling out ridiculous shit for what it is.
The ability to attack the right in an edgy way has dried up. They have to drill for laughs in a new field.
Comedy is conservative again
Thousands of supportive comments in the other reddit threads suggest this guy has bipartisan support.
"This is whats known to stand up comedians as ""burning the room down"""
"Meaning, no other comedian can follow your act. For an extreme example check out Bill Burrs 'philly rant'"
Burr's rant was the stuff of legends.
When a man gets pushed to far. It was the real deal.
too*
"I mean no other comedian could follow Bill Burr regardless of what he did that night, the crowd was pretty belligerent."
"Well, not these days. I remember a time where ol billy red nuts was unknown. "
"Also, after the philly rant another comic had to follow(poor SOB). And BB actually started to turn the crowd back by the 13th minute."
"The great Patrice Oneal used to love to do this, he called it ""walking the room."""
He was great. Old O &amp; A shows with him are the tops.
I miss that man
I wish the camera went back to Tim Cook when Gervais mentioned the sweat shops. 😂
Or to DeNiro when he mentioned not being political.
"Wait, are you telling me DeNiro isn't an expert in political science?"
But he is one of the biggest actors in Hollywood. That means he is also one of the biggest authorities on anything else.
I won't watch the Irishman because of him.  I don't care if it is free on netflix.
You shouldn’t watch it because it’s 3 of the slowest hours a human could endure
"My wife wanted to watch it, I fell asleep."
"I actually loved the movie.  And it's 4 hours, lol.  I just split it into 4 1-hour watch sessions.  Probably should have been a mini series"
yeah i broke it up too.  and it felt like a nice last homage to the mob movies of old.
Also it’s 4 hours long. Pass
I won't watch any of his movies anymore... I skip past godfather 2... that POS
Go figure the elite owners of the most powerful sites... sitting in a room full of deviant pedophiles.
When he uses sweat shop workers. Cant make it up... they keep the company that fits them
This man is a breath of fresh air
He had a show I watched recently on Netflix was it?
After Life.
"It was about a guy dealing with losing his wife to cancer  It was non-PC, gritty and low-key wonderful...but not for kids."
[deleted]
"Not to diminish your feelings but that was the point of the joke.   I could not get past Rita in Dexter, I had to wait two years to take the series up again."
"“You know nothing about the real world, most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg”"
LMAO he’s the best
And still the dumbass of Joaquin phoenix starts talking shit about veganism and climate change 🙄😒
Lord give me strength...
I like Joaquin but did he really start lecturing about that stuff
I thought he was drunk.
"He has crippling social anxiety on stage, it's just his natural predisposition. I am not gonna knock him for it."
"Joaquin Phoenix most definitely doesn't suffer from stage fright. Have you seen ""I'm Still Here,"" or the related interviews and rap shows he's done? He was acting the entire time for that, and held it together really well."
"I can't imagine him seriously lecturing people as mentioned here; it was more likely just something he did to be satirical, or just for the sheer hell of it or kicks and giggles. Because if the guy has any self-awareness, which his career and public persona suggest, there's no way he'd try to proselytize about anything to anyone; he'd know it wouldn't be taken seriously. (This is doubly true even if you believe his rap pursuit wasn't an act.)"
"he is a hardcore enviromentalist though, has been for years, just because he made a movie we like. does not mean he is on our side."
"Thank you for the award, thanks to the cast and crew, thanks family and friends, bye."
The he shouldn't do award shows. He gets no pass from me
"I really, really hope so."
I want to like him but he convinced me to hate him for all time because of how great a villain he was as Commodus
👍🏻👎🏻
"Heh damn that was funny. Funny because its both so obviously true to everyone, yet everyone is to damn afraid to say it. Finally...bravo Ricky."
"We hear all kinds of Hollywood types talk about ""speaking truth to power"", but in reality they take the safest, easiest path you can take in Hollywood, by going full woke and bashing anyone to the right of Che Guevara as a ""fascist"". They ARE the power, in addition to being utterly narcissistic dimwits, untethered to reality."
What Ricky did WAS INDEED an example of speaking truth to power...one of the very few times we will witness it on that stage.
"Apparently they had an all vegan awards dinner this year.  He said something like, ""Dinner was vegetables...so are the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press association...here's the president..."""
"And then the President said: ""Ricky, every year you say it's your last year hosting.  Would you put that in writing?"""
Hollywood only likes truth that lines up with their version of truth.
"On T_D there’s a conspiracy theory that this was some kind of planned, fully vetted appeasement ploy for rating$ and to make Hollywood seem “safe” again."
Maybe for their Chinese overlords...
"How would it help ratings if nobody knew it was going to happen? I only just saw the clip, I'm not watching the show or anything."
"Word would presumably get out and try to thaw the red states a little toward Hollywood at-large. Seems far fetched but we’re living through all the post-modern, post-logic craziness now."
"I was watching football before hand and ended up seeing the opening monologue. It was hilarious, but once the circle jerk of the assholes giving awards to themselves started, I turned the channel."
"Doubtful, that seemed like vintage Gervais, and he could have just as easily roasted Trump over something. And if hosts again may do so."
"Even if it was planned, it’s hardly a “conspiracy” for Hollywood to plan and try to change its image. No need for tin foil hats. That’s just called PR. Jeezus."
Wouldn't surprise me if that were true.
Tom Hanks face at the very end of the video is priceless.
Loved this
Balls the likes of which Hollywood has never seen. What an honest declaration by a man who knows exactly who he is.
<strong>BOOM. ROASTED.</strong>
Dammit. You beat me to it.
Wow! Listening to that was refreshing!
I don’t know who the lady was but she made a comment along the lines of “kids wake up in the Middle East not knowing if bombs and war are going off because we have a president who tweets things about bombs” during her acceptance speech. 
When was the Middle East peaceful and stable before Trump? When did kids in the Middle East get access to twitter?
"Don't you know? History, all of existence, started when Trump became president."
"Your not kidding. The ""beginning"" of WWII in 1939 started because Trump was elected president in 2016. Also the start of WWI in 1914 was a direct result of Trump winning the Republican nomination."
I asked someone on r politics about what point in history they wanted to return to.
Their answer?
2014.
"Pretty sure Democrats aren't truly that miopic and naive. I think it's mostly an act to make them look like empathetic, genuine people; if they act simple/dumb, that just helps their virtue-signalling as they know most people associate high intelligence with malice, (look at how people talk about psychopaths, for example) and they don't want the public to see them for their own malice."
"Maybe some young people are truly ignorant of history, but I think those who'd be decent anyway aren't going around making such crazy claims; they know they don't know everything, and thus they're the type to actually pay attention in history class and learn things (on their own, hopefully)"
I think it was Patricia Arquette. I dont recall her talking about war and bombs during Obama’s 8 year bomb-a-thon
“That’s because he won the nobel peace prize!”
It’s hard to “wake up and not know if bombs are coming” when you died in your sleep during one of Obama’s countless drone strikes that hit civilian targets “accidentally” instead of killing Iranian generals in precision takedowns.
Was she not the heroin addict in Pulp Fiction?  The role suited her well.
Patricia Arquette always says some dumb bullshit.
I guess they didn’t take Ricky’s advice! To be expected.
Didn’t Obama drone a wedding or two?
And a hospital
"Patricia Arquette should tend to her breast implants instead of assuming everyone who votes will be voting Trump out. Wrong, hon. Stick to the little entertainment gig and hush up."
And why would kids follow Trump on twitter?
The US and especially when Trump is president gets a set of different rules. Like how people declare us a racist country when we are the least racist country in the world. We have overcome our downfalls including our racism in a remarkably short amount of time relative to other countries that have been around longer than us and still haven’t even reached the progress we have.
Absolute legend
Ricky is so NOT PC - I love his honesty.
This was either a brilliant PR stunt because someone finally can sniff that everyone hates their shit or he actually pulled this one over on them. We'll see if he gets any more work.  
All I got to say is hell ya.
"Rocky is pretty fucking liberal. He wasn't calling them out for their politics, just their preachiness."
"That’s fair though, and I appreciate his ability to recognize preachiness in his own people and mock it"
Damn.
It's about time someone in Hollywood said this.
"It’s hilarious to me seeing how upvoted this clip is on other popular subreddits, as if they haven’t been consistently parroting the same exact woke nonsense these celebrities have been espousing."
"You mean like, all of them...?"
What I love most is a lot of the reddit leftist folks are celebrating this too. Like the same people who probably brigade around twitter with the ‘look at me look how woke I am’ attitude
"Someone give this man a medal!! I laughed so hard I was choking on my dinner, take that Hollywood."
"Oh no. Has he been ""cancelled"" yet? "
A comedian NEEDS to be a democrat leftist or else they're not funny and need to be shamed and canceled. 
/s.
He’s extremely left.
"Yeah Ricky is as left as it comes, but he has no problem pointing out the faults and hypocrisy within his own ranks. Something more people all over the political spectrum need to do."
Just like Joe Rogan and Bill Burr who get called Alt Right. Now Ricky Gervis will be called Alt Right.
Ricky Gervais may have just become my favorite celeb
I wonder if they just want to get half their audience back with this light roast.
Damn!  The Russians got to him too!  They're everywhere!
"After Life was a good show, looking forward to season 2."
That was so satisfying to watch.
Oh the truth is so brutal.
"I thought I loved Ricky Gervais before. If you haven’t, go watch his Netflix special"
This was the best thing since sliced bread
"Finally someone said it. I typically don’t like Gervais, but damn, this was a home-run."
I thought liveleak was the only place I could see a dude burn an entire room full of people to the ground
It's amazing that the liberals on Reddit are posting this like it isn't a gigantic rip on them.
"Greta is brave? No, she has it easy. THIS guy is brave."
"Fucking legend. I'm glad someone FINALLY had the balls to say this, and to Hollywood's smug faces!! God, thank you for letting me see this in my lifetime. So incredibly epic. "
"I honestly, I don't know why it popped in my head yesterday. But I thought to myself, ""what industry has more award shows than Hollywood?? How many times a year, every year, do they give themselves an award show?"" Honestly it's like what a dozen award shows?"
"It's so incredibly devoid of any substance it's incredible they still have the gall to put these on. They have all the money in the world, are the top 5% of society, yet they still continue to parade around and pat themselves on the back like a pumped up 5 year old. Fucking pathetic. I hope all those rapists get what's coming to them. "
Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
Edit to correct capitalization mistakes.
"Finally! Someone is telling these out of touch, virtue signaling, hypocritical, Hollywood elites off. Good for him."
Wow! I almost wish I'd watched it. I especially loved the Epstein and Farrow shots.
The look on Tom Hanks’ face really says it all. And these Hollywood liberal elitists wonder why people have stopped tuning into award ceremonies and late night talk shows...
"He really needs to make an ""I'm not feeling suicidal"" clip after that. Hillary will be pissed he's upset all her puppets."
"Awesome, thank you."
Finally a bastard in Hollywood with some balls!!
There is some truth in all good comedy.
Ricky is so goddamn based
Ricky you're my Hero
"Keep watching folks, you just give them credence."
This was the only part I watched of the whole show
"I'm pretty sure he doesn't plan on doing the show again, lol."
"Holy Crap!  Well, he won't be invited back."
"“Everyone’s watching Netflix. This show should just be me coming out, going, ‘Well done Netflix, you win everything. Good night.'”"
About time someone said it
He opened up talking about the BS that happened to Kevin Hart too.
👏 This 👏 is 👏 fucking 👏 awesome 👏
Goood. Hollywood is a hub for corruption and vanity
"Enjoy your visit from the Secret Service, George."
El Chicano was good. Lopez should just transition to drama and leave the comedy to others.
"When you have to use assassinating the President of the United States as comedy material, just like Kathy Griffin did, you apparently are at the end of your comedy career because you have run out of original and quality material."
“Comedian” is a generous title.
When does it require the USSS to take action?
Where is the line... this seems to be pretty close.
[deleted]
I’d say that this borders on the lines of a joke.
Clearly because it targets your side; everyone else and their nan can see that it was a joke and intended as such. There is no need to be triggered by it.
"They keep getting it wrong. These are the people who grew up learning that nothing was their fault. That there was something else they didn't account for, which is why they are wrong time and time again. "
But do they learn from their mistakes? Nope.
"Iran should learn from Kenny Rodgers.  ""Know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away and know when to run""  If they call another bluff, I see all gasoline being gone in the entire country.  Trump is not someone to not take a truly strategic hit.  Iran is already hurting, zero fuel will be crippling.  Iran needs to wise up - they are not dealing with some lame dick like Obama or Bush.  Trump is going to fuck them up and he is not kidding.  heck I hope they call the hand and the US disintegrates all of their refineries with six 21 year olds in Nevada flying a video game.  Turning their entire economy into a starvation shit show.   I want to see how many of the Mullahs henchman are still standing after a year of starvation.  Try harvesting crops with no fuel.  Oh it is hard, how about importing food - oh you can't   well fuck off."
"I would say the biggest issue is that we have given Iran too much deference.  They have no ally.  China and Russia won't go to bat for Iran.  Iran is playing with fire and they are wearing gas soaked clothing.   No country in the world gives a shit if they crash and burn, most hope for them to self detonate.  If they call the US, we take out 3 refineries, they have zero fuel for cars, and farm tractors.  Literally 3 tomahawks send them into starvation."
Don’t post articles that are hiding behind a paywall...
"We need the Chunk!  <a href=""/u/ChunkyArsenio"" rel=""nofollow"">/u/ChunkyArsenio</a>"
"Hey, I just happened to check my reddit and saw your message :)"
<strong>Article:</strong>
"DUBAI—A few days before a U.S. drone killed Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, the chief of the Iranian navy flew to inspect the first-ever joint naval exercises that the Islamic Republic conducted with the U.S.’s global rivals: Russia and China."
"“Today, the era of American free action in the region is over, and they must leave the region,” Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi declared as a Chinese guided-missile destroyer, a Russian frigate and 12 other vessels jointly patrolled the Arabian Sea."
"Instead of leaving, President Trump now is sending thousands more American troops to the Middle East to confront Iran. As for Russia and China, they have shown little desire to get embroiled in an increasingly unpredictable conflict."
"This means that despite the feverish talk of Gen. Soleimani’s death sparking a World War III, Iran nowadays can only count on itself—and on the network of irregular Shiite militias and proxies that the Quds Force commander had nurtured in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and beyond."
"“Iran is one of the most strategically lonely countries in the world. It considers dozens of countries around the world its adversary, and its only reliable friend has been the Assad regime in Syria,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington."
"As for Russia, Mr. Sadjadpour added, “it benefits from an isolated, anti-American Iran that can’t exploit its energy resources.”"
While observers say Beijing and Moscow would be happy to watch the U.S. get bogged down even deeper in the Middle East—a diversion that would give them a freer hand in their own neighborhoods—they have no appetite for exposing themselves to the risks of a possible confrontation.
"“Russia doesn’t have the slightest intention of getting involved in this squabble, and is trying to distance itself from it as far as possible—even though it will keep expressing support for Iran with very loud declarations,” said Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow think tank that advises Russia’s defense establishment."
"“Short-term at least, this is all beneficial to Russia: oil prices are up, and the Iranians—a very difficult partner—are being forced to become much more cooperative,” he added."
"Iran’s strategic isolation perhaps explains a tone of caution that has accompanied its denunciations of Gen. Soleimani’s death. Iranian Armed Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi on Saturday promised a revenge that will be “tough”—but “not hasty,” an indication that Tehran may seek to avoid an immediate escalation that could risk sparking an all-out war with the U.S."
"“Iran is talking about a response, a revenge, and not about initiating a war,” said Abas Aslani, senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran."
"Should such a direct conflict erupt, he added, “I don’t think Iran expects Russia and China to start a war with the U.S. on its behalf. The help they may offer to Iran is different: political support, support in some international institutions. Whether that can also be applicable to providing Iran with some equipment, that is the question.”"
"Iran certainly craves military hardware to replace its obsolete warplanes, ships and tanks—but neither Russia nor China can legally supply such equipment until October at the earliest, the date when United Nations sanctions on most military sales to Tehran are set to expire."
"Russia did deliver an S-300 air-defense system to Iran in 2016, but even that happened after six years of delays that ended only as a result of Moscow’s alienation from the West following its invasion of Ukraine."
"In their official reactions, both Moscow and Beijing condemned the strike against Gen. Soleimani—but stopped short of pledging to do anything about it."
"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a phone call Friday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the killing “grossly violates the norms of international law” and urged Washington to “solve all problems at the negotiating table,” according to a Russian foreign ministry statement."
"China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, a day later told his Iranian counterpart that Beijing condemns “the military adventurist act by the U.S.” and that China will continue to “play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and security in the Gulf region.”"
"Though China has promised to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in Iran’s oil and gas infrastructure, so far U.S. economic sanctions on Iran have hobbled such plans."
"Russia and Iran have teamed up in Syria—with Russian warplanes using Iranian airspace and even briefly operating out of an air base in Iran—but as the Syrian regime stabilized and Moscow found a new accommodation with Turkey in recent months, Moscow’s and Tehran’s interests there have begun to diverge."
Both Moscow and Beijing maintain friendly ties with Iran’s archenemies in the region: Saudi Arabia and Israel.
"Russia’s and Iran’s mutual history is rife with hostility. Russians remember the murder of Russia’s ambassador and playwright Alexander Griboedov when the Russian embassy in Tehran was sacked in 1829, and the Islamic Republic’s support for anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s."
"Looming in Iran’s national memory are lands that Russia annexed from the Persian Empire over the centuries, and the Soviet military invasions and occupations of Iran in 1920 and 1941."
"“Nobody in Russia really cares about Iran, the society doesn’t see Iran as a partner, and certainly not as a friend worth dying for,” said Alexander Gabuev, chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific program at the Carnegie Moscow Center."
"Both Russia and China, he added, are secretly delighted by the rise of tensions between the U.S. and Iran, hoping that a conflict in the Middle East would give them a few years of respite by distracting American attention away from their own core areas of interests in Eastern Europe and Asia, respectively."
"Even though China is now the biggest buyer of Middle Eastern oil, experts in the country’s security and foreign-policy establishment have long argued that Beijing should resist the temptation of getting involved in the volatile region—in part because oil has continued to flow despite the political shocks of recent decades."
"“The Middle East presents a falling significance in the grand strategy of China,” Niu Xinchun, director of the Institute of Middle East Studies at CICIR, a think tank affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security, wrote in a 2017 policy paper. “As a matter of fact, since 2011, many Middle Eastern countries have descended into civil war at the same time, which failed to exert material impacts on China’s economy.”"
"China’s participation in the December naval exercises with Iran is “more symbolic than substantial,” added Zhu Feng, director of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University. “I don’t think China has any interest in getting involved in the escalation of tensions there.”"
"Yet while Iran can expect little immediate help from Moscow and Beijing, the long-term picture is more alarming, said Vali Nasr, a professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins and a former senior State Department adviser."
"“What the U.S. is doing is pushing Russia, China and Iran gradually together. They share a certain common cause in standing up to America’s use of maximum force,” Mr. Nasr said."
"“It’s not something that we will see the effect of tomorrow, but we may look back 10 years from now and see the Trump years as the period where his entanglement with Iran has incentivized Russia and China to develop defense strategies against the kind of policies that the U.S. is using against Iran today—but could potentially in the future also use against them.”"
Thank you once again my friend.

"So? CNN's business model is built around lying. Except for the apology, he fits right in."
"I know there are ‘possibly’ some actual good journalists at CNN who are scared shitless of what has become of their company, those who were outspoken and pissed they would let this ass-clown become a contributor.  I’d say gtfo while they can, save their career, but probably too late.  CNN is on fire and there’s no stopping it until the last ember burns out.  Serves them right."

"""Soleimani was a bastard who deserved to die, but I have concerns about the wider implications in the region"" is a defensible position <em>if you've been a consistent non-interventionist.</em>  If you voted for the people who turned Libya into a failed state with open slave markets, sit this one out.  "
"Also, I would like to ask Mr. Schiff, if Soleimani was ""responsible for unthinkable violence,"" what do you think would be the appropriate sentence for the guy who sent him a pallet of cash in the middle of the night?"
Cash in exchange for reelection? Sounds like Quid Pro Quo...
"Very well said, Bite. There is no way on God’s green earth that this man can be defended. He is a monster that received far less than what he deserved. There is not enough hate on the planet for a man like him."
"May he burn in Hell for all eternity,"
No one’s defending him. It’s a straw man the GOP is feeding you to distract you. There are tons of shitty people out there the world would be better off without. That doesn’t mean killing them comes without consequence that might be greater than letting them live. That people pretending that’s the not the case will cost lives.
Why are you acting like this was done just to kill a bad man?
This was done in retaliation for an attack on our embassy that this dude planned and to stop his reign of terror all over the region.
I’m not. You are projecting.
Why are you pretending like this couldn’t lead to a war with thousands of US casualties?
"It could, but we didn't start it and we can't just sit here letting Iran attack over and over again."
"Yes, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a poor strategic decision."
Nice summation of what has lead up to this point and how foolish the Democrats are being by taking Iran's side in light of this.

"Philip D. Zelikow, the executive director of the 9/11 report, actually identifies nine key moments in Clinton’s presidency when a different decision might have led to bin Laden’s death. “On every one of these nine choices there are people who believe the President could have made a different choice,” Zelikow said. “And, in each case, there are people who believe the President made the right call.”"
"“It then becomes a judgment call — one that in our report we left to the reader to make, after trying to lay out the relevant facts and varying opinions as dispassionately as we could,” Zelikow added."
"We summarized each of these choices, as outlined in the 9/11 Commission report, using as much of the language of the original report as possible. Not every one of these decisions officially came to the attention of Clinton, but his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, kept close tabs on the process — and he worked closely with Clinton."
"The reasons varied why a particular attack did not go forward — fear of civilian casualties, uncertainty in the intelligence, diplomatic fallout, bureaucratic inertia. During Clinton’s presidency, al-Qaeda attacked U.S. targets overseas, not in the homeland. Media attention was fleeting. When the CIA suddenly withdrew its support for one operation, the commission wrote: “It was the duty of [George] Tenet and the CIA leadership to balance the risks of inaction against jeopardizing the lives of their operatives and agents. And they had reason to worry about failure: millions of dollars down the drain; a shoot-out that could be seen as an assassination; and, if there were repercussions in Pakistan, perhaps a coup.”"
<strong>NO BUTS.</strong>
Interestingly the only ones who are sad over Soleimani are terrorists and democrats.  Oh thats rundant..
can we do it without much collateral damage?
"This has aged well. Is a new, open war enough collateral? I believe Qassem deserved his assassination. I'm not sure that the manner in which it was conducted was smart or will lead to anything but the usual trade of many good lives for one bad one. I think we're about to trade many more, because I don't know if DJT has the finesse needed to de-escalate."
"Also, if you know the history of the region, you'll also know that the Iran's rival in the region, Saudi Arabia, are an equally destructive, destabilizing force, and their rich wahabbists are our best bet as far as who funded 9/11 — but they also pay big in Washington and are really close to DJT, so they get a pass. <strong>Seems like this is their war and we should let them fight it?</strong>"
"I'm no hippie, all for making local war to keep global peace. This aint it, chief. Seems dumb. Dems wouldn't do better, but I gotta call stupid when I see it."
Qassem's death happened without much collateral damage.
"""Collateral damage"" doesn't mean ""Won't make them angry enough to try to attack us yet again"""
"It means: ""Will this attack mostly only kill the bad guys and not kill other civilians."""
"This aint it, chief. Seems dumb. Dems wouldn't do better, but I gotta call stupid when I see it."

"Eh, Florida is very liberal from my experience, but I probably am wrong. Super funny picture though!"
"Only in major cities (Orlando/Miami) like anywhere else.. I live in very conservative area of Florida. Most of the state is rural. It's a swing state, not a deep blue."

Center left still votes liberal/democrat.  But I agree it isn't a screaming commie cesspool like NY/CA/Portland.
Are there any rural areas that arnt horrible? It seemed from my experience it is either meth or extreme poverty everywhere there but the cities and beaches.
"I enjoyed my time in Ocala which is north central Florida, about 30 mins south of Gainesville. Beautiful horse country there.  I live on the space coast now and it's pretty nice as well, lot of great companies to work for here.  Extremely low taxes and cost of living, not surrounded by lefty screamers."
"That's what so great about Florida... No income tax, great for small business and you don't have liberals trying to force their ideas down your throat lmfao"
"Sadly can't say the same, they're stuffing them down hard for me"
If you liked that area I dont think we would agree on much about places to live.
"Which is totally fine, pretty awesome thing about living in the most diverse and greatest country in the world."
Jacksonville is a big city that is always republican
"It all depends where you go tbh. Dade and Broward are pretty liberal on paper, but there's a lot of right leaning people because a good amount migrated to Florida to escape Socialism. We also have a Republican Governor who has one the best approval ratings in the country (If not the best)"
"Eh Florida is weird. It’s probably the weirdest Republican state. I would say RINO is the best word to describe Florida politics. Many RINOs are good at Republican economics but suck at the social stuff like abortion, guns, etc. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts is like that. Meanwhile here in Florida, the Republicans have managed to keep the state one of the least regulated states in the country. At the same time we’re more liberal on abortion than most conservative states. The RINO state government gave us red flag laws last year. We’re already one of the five states to ban open carry and it doesn’t look like it’s going to change anytime soon. It also depends on what area of Florida you’re talking about too. It’s an odd state for sure"
Yeah it's weird for sure
"Like most states, only a few districts are liberal and their packed with them. Most of the districts are conservative and loosely populated."
Ah I see. I must live in one of the liberal ones but I try to stay strong :v

"Oh, you're one of those loons that actually think their will be a draft."
Would you like some lubricant?

It's easy for lefties to fit it up there because their heads are empty.
"As a former soldier with a family, I have no problem leaving them to protect them and others from terrorists that knowingly attack legitimate American installations and target and kill Americans. It's people like us that secure your freedom to talk ridiculous crap. You're welcome"

"We freed them from a genocidal dictator who was ethnically cleaning the country, thousands of our troops perished in their lands and we helped them fight off a complete takeover by ISIS. If they want us to leave, they can repay their debt."
"Yes. After everything we've done for them, they can repay their debt. They don't get to pull a hindsight 20/20 move with Saddam and ISIS. 
If they kick us out for defending our embassy (our sovereign soil that the Iraq gov was SUPPOSED to defend), and blame US for escalating, then fuck 'em; pay up."
How many of them even remember Sadam. He lost power 17 years ago. 20 somethings were small kids.
They blame ISIS on the fact that Sadam was taken out of power. Iraqi see their country much different than Americans do.

That is like someone coming to your house and living in your bedroom. Then after 17 years charges you for the updates they made when you ask them to think about moving out.

"Hardly. It more like seeing your abusive boyfriend in your house that you can't get rid of, beating the ever living shit out of you and kicking down the door to get him off you. Then cleaning out the gang of thugs squatting there. Then leaving and watching the house immediately get broken in by the neighbors and pillaged, coming back to kick their ass. Then leasing a room there and spending a fortune fixing it up, then being told to get out because you beat up some other neighbor thug who was threatening us."
"Yup, makes Iraq look like an ungrateful POS.  Though I think Iraq needs to become super majority Sunni muslims, as right now they are a nation divided."
People say we are only there for the oil...yet if that was the case we'd had net-positive by now.  So that opinion seems full of shit and propaganda.  Why don't we take their oil?  Use the proceeds to help keep peace in the region because they obviously can't.  If its not us it'll eventually be China and Russia while the Europeans sit on their ass.
I think the most charitable way to view the American left today is to see their goal through their eyes.  Their goal that they believe will result in good outcomes is to bring the US into the fold of a one world government with a completely global and socialized economy.  
​
"Thus, the ""citizen of the world"" crap I see at my daughter's school.  "
​
"Continuing to be extremely charitable (just to point out their insanity), they believe that if the whole world is run by 1 global socialist government, there would be no more wars, no more killing, no more crime, no reason for the existence of nukes, stuff like that.  "
​
"They believe this can only happen if we eliminate patriotism (and they're doing the same thing in other countries, too).  From that goal, they believe if they diminish the spirit of our patriotism, they'll get closer to eliminating these hurdles to their goal.  The primary way to destroy that patriotism is to disparage our nation and its history.  "
​
Pretty Orwellian stuff.
This is really accurate as far as the global citizen stuff.  I am finishing up a busEcon degree and almost all of my 400 level mgmt classes have a 1 week unit on being a social conscious company that emphasizes global citizenry.  It's taught at all levels - home school your kids everyone.
home school your kids everyone.
"For as long as it's legal, anyway. I suspect that once we hit 35-40%, the feds will suddenly declare homeschooling a ""national threat""."
Excellent description of the left taking them at their best.  But it always comes back to history repeating itself and human nature that is ingrained in our DNA.  No one is going to work while others reap the same rewards while sitting on their dumb uneducated asses.  Never has happened and never will.  But the truly dumb and brain dead deny thousands of years of recorded human history and believe in a fairly tale sold to them by the very people wanting to rule over them and subjugate them.
You need to find a new school for your daughter.
"Yeah, I did."
If you believe this then you haven’t spoken to a Democrat in a long time. Maybe instead of “looking through their eyes” ask one?
"From a former Dem who is still surrounded by Dems both in the workforce and the family, pull the other one. These are the commonly held ""progressive"" worldviews that led me to abandon the party."
I’ve never heard “one world Government “ from any Democrat. Probably because it’s fabricated.
Have you heard them talking about what the US should do based on UN Resolutions or how we are violating International Law?
I live and work near Washington DC and work with people who were very involved with many different Democratic campaigns over the last 10 years.  From campaign managers to phone bankers.    
"Furthermore, it is very clear from their own campaign information pages to surveys of average Democratic voters."
"You're definitely right about the 1 socialist government, but I'm not seeing the anti-patriotism bit. No one but your strawman says you can't love your country. People are disparaging the attack, not because we like guy, but because killing an Iranian war hero (in their eyes) has caused the Iranian people who were previously attacking the government to embrace it. In addition, Iran is now cancelling the nuclear deal, and Iraq is expelling US forces. Guess who's gonna fill that power vacuum? Sure, we iced a terrorist, but the cost has been massive."
"We didn't just ice a terrorist, Trump stopped an active invasion of US soil.    "
How do you not understand that?
I fail to understand the part where he stopped an active invasion. Is Iraq US soil?
All embassies are considered US soil.  Attacking a US embassy is a pretty bad idea.
"Embassies are not US soil, common misconception. In addition, the militia backed by Iran (technically not Iran but admittedly close), failed to enter the embassy itself. In addition, they vandalized it, no one was harmed. In addition, this is not an ""active invasion"", it is neither."
An Iran backed militia vandalized the compound surrounding the US embassy on Iranian soil 4 days ago. Trump didn't stop an active invasion by killing the guy. 
"What he did do was ass up the situation, ruin the nuclear deal, harm the Iranian population's support of the US, make the US look bad internationally, and now Iran is swearing revenge. This was an utter failure."
They were attempting to breach the embassy and had overt plans to try harder.  They launched multiple attacks  and had no intention of stopping that attack until Trump responded.
"That wasn't an attack, it was a protest. No one was hurt. There was a standoff, tresspassing, some tear gassing, a couple fires, and a sit in. We have worse protests here in the US. Before the airstrike, we had a mostly peaceful protest consisting of a few hundred people. Now, we have millions of people with newly increased support for their government screaming Death to America, and swearing revenge. Trump killed a terrorist, but he made a thousand more."
"It wasn’t an attack, just a violent mob threatening to kill them and “trespassing.” "
Lol!!!!

And? That's just pictures of the fires.
"And yes, US Embassies are, for all practical purposes, soil of the US.  The US personnel and military were in present danger and the POTUS has a clear Article II duty to protect them from further incursions.    "
"Furthermore, under international law, the US Embassy is provided all protections and the US all privileges and immunities to protect its embassies just as if it was US Soil.  "
​
"<em>767 Third Ave. Associates v. Permanent Mission</em>, 988 F.2d 295 "
​
Killing a member of a military actively attacking or planning to attack US Troops and diplomatic missions is squarely within the international law and US law province of the US government.
"You'd have a very good point if any US personal were in danger, or if they were attacked, or if the protesters were armed. None of those were the case. As it were, the militia actually requested the protesters to leave. Not to mention, the POTUS hasn't provided much proof that the official was planning anything. It's worth noting this may be a ploy to take attention off of the whole impeachment thing, but whatever."
"They were in danger, go look at Iran’s announcements."
I stand corrected.
"However, I don’t believe this was an utter failure.  By all accounts, this guy was the source of a lot of misery and death, including hundreds of US casualties.  "
"I don’t think much will come of this, to be honest.  Iran can swear revenge all they want.  They’ve been chanting “Death to America” for decades, arming terrorists all over the world, and engaging in these kinds of proxy attacks for too long.  So let them swear whatever they want.  "
"They can choose to de-escalate the situation, or they can choose to make things much worse for themselves.  I don’t think Trump wants to go to war with ANYONE, but I also don’t think he’ll back down if Iran decides they want to keep testing him.  "
"One thing everyone should notice by now...you almost never see Trump badmouth anyone unprovoked, but once they attack him, you never see him back down."
"We have to see the bigger picture. Killing this terrorist, no matter how well deserved, isn't fixing anything. All it's done is piss off the Iranian public who viewed him as a hero. The same Iranians who were just protesting against their government are now siding with the government because, in their eyes, the evil USA just killed their hero. This isn't how you descalate at all! The US has to be the bigger person, or nation here. Instead of that, Iran has cancelled the nuclear deal and is screaming Death to America, and Trump is threatening literal war crimes. Imagine what our allies are thinking - oh wait, they're condemning us. This is a diplomatic shitshow."
"I disagree.  The nuclear deal has always been a sham, Iran has been shouting “Death to America” for decades as I said, and Trump simply told them what would happen should they decide to do anything foolish.  That’s not threatening war crimes, it’s just the reality of the situation.  "
"If someone who is bigger and stronger warns you about what will happen if you fuck around, and then you decide to fuck around anyway, whatever happens to you is your own fault.  "
"Telling an opponent “if you don’t start none, there wont be none” is pretty diplomatic as far as I’m concerned.  If Iran does something foolish in retaliation, you won’t catch me sympathizing with them.  In my experience, if someone calmly tells you to “fuck around and find out” you should be ready for whatever happens."
"I don’t want war to break out over this, and I don’t think it will.  But if it does, you won’t catch me falling in with the “Death to America” crowd."
"The nuclear deal was good for 15 years, hopefully enough time to smooth over relations and intertwine our economies. Perfect? No. Better than nothing? Yes. Do you prefer it now that Iran is back to enriching uranium? Is that a win for the US? "
"The ""reality of the situation"" is that in 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated, the UN security council, that the US is on, agreed that the destruction of cultural monuments was a war crime. That's the same thing Trump is now threatening to do, over Twitter. "
"Bigger army dimplomacy won't work here. This isn't an issue that can be solved with violence. Any agression, of which the US is bringing in plenty, is just going to inspire hatred of the US and loyalty to the government among the Iranian people."
An invasion of a US embassy is an invasion of US Soil.
"Not an invasion, not active, and embassies are not US soil. (Google it real quick)"
"Yes, it was an invasion and POTUS is obligated by law to use deadly force to protect them."
"No, and also what? That's not a law, that's  not even close. Where are you getting this?"
"You would need the Iranian government entering US territory to constitute an invasion, this was Iranian citizens entering the complex around a US embassy. Even if the Iranian military rocked up and killed every person in the embassy, it still wouldn't be an invasion."
It is absolutely an invasion on US grounds protected by the US military with US military and diplomatic personnel there.    
The POTUS has the Article II duty to take care that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed.    
The Congress passed and POTUS signed the NDAA of 2019 by a house vote of 359-54 OVERWHELMING democratic support; their propaganda of the last week is laughable. 
​
"These NDAA laws have been passed through the Trump administration and Obama administration largely instructing the POTUS to fight terrorism where the POTUS finds it, protect US personnel, and authorizes counter-terrorism actions more generally.    "
Obama used his NDAA authority to invade 6 countries that were not explicitly authorized... crickets from the left.    
"Trump uses it to kill a uniformed officer of a hostile foreign nation who had expressed his intent to invade the US embassy and to kill US military and diplomatic personnel in violation of US and international law.  The Iraqi government violated its duties under international law when it failed to protect the embassy; so Trump defended it, properly.  "
​
"Such uniformed hostile officer was killed while he was on the battlefield coordinating an attack on US personnel.  Trump did what Obama should have done and I hope Trump continues to protect US personnel and diplomatic missions.  If Iran attacks us again, I hope Trump nukes Tehran 52 times."
Who said Obama handled it well?
"An invasion is defined as an armed force entering a country or region with the intent to occupy or supress. The protesters were not an armed force, they didn't enter the embassy, and the embassy is Iranian territory. "
"Trump has not presented any evidence that Soleimani was planning or threatening anything. He wasn't on the battlefield either, he was in the Baghdad airport. This has led to the evacuation of many US personnel from the country- hardly protecting them. Putting aside your nuke comment, I really feel you should reconsider your sources."
"I have a feeling, we're going to find out quite clearly, on 11/03/20 that there are a <strong><em>WHOOOOOOLE</em></strong> lot fewer of these democrats than we feared."
I really hope so
I'd rather not count on that theory and just demand that conservatives turn out to vote.
Agreed.
"we're going to find out quite clearly, on 11/03/20"
Hope you are correct.  I still fear that we might have reached the tipping point with a clear majority of ignorant assholes being able to vote in our country.  The type of ignorant assholes that have the ability to deny reality and believe the propaganda of the lying liberal media.
They  had no issues with Obama dropping bombs. That should tell you all you need to know.
They had no issues with Obama dropping bombs.
"I was just walking through a public area with a tv tuned to msnbc and the chryon was ""War Powers Act""..and immediately thought what you brought up.  The lying liberal media didn't give a rat's ass about obama droning the shit out of people for 8 years.  Who the fuck watches this shit without seeing the Glaring hypocrisy."
I can answer this with one simple phrase.
I sincerely believe that’s a book written by radio host Phil Valentine
"Edit: I was close, but wrong; it’s Michael Savage."
Correct!
"To them a ""fair trial"" is when the <em>prosecutor</em> gets to do whatever he/she wants.  "
"In contrast, sane people use that phrase to refer to the concerns of the defendant."
Weirdly Stalin agreed with the idea that a prosecutor should be able to do whatever he/she wanted...
This is why I think that we may be beyond the point where reconciliation is possible.
"They are no longer just a party of subversives, but have literally become a political party of ""traitors"" - a ""Fifth Column"" openly."
"They have been indoctrinated to operate under a constant, fundamental belief that the United States is uniquely ""bad"", which is why a pro-American political message is revolting to them."
"I’ve never seen such political footballing in my entire life. I’m absolutely convinced that no matter what Trump does, CNN will continue to vilify him, and so will all the other leftists who go there to get their marching orders."
They know that if they win they can rewrite history. They own the public schools and university system. So any unethical tactic is fine in their book.
They own the public schools and university system
correct....and remember they own the media too.  So there is no lie too big that they cannot sell to the morons.
"I'll get downvoted to hell for this but whatever. I'm a liberal and I'm glad that Soleimani is gone; he was certainly a threat to American lives. However, killing him was not the best move. Now our relations with Iran are even worse than they were previously and Iran is threatening to get their revenge. Furthermore, he will just be replaced by another major general with the exact same (or harsher) anti-American plans."
"What do you believe is worse about our relationship with now as opposed to before we killed him? And why would you believe that the man who replaces him would be worse? He was their top guy for a reason, now they have to use their backup guy. And if he wants to test his authority against us he can get taken out too, then the next runner-up comes in... sooner or later Iran has to learn that they don't have the cards to back up their bluffs. I would agree with you if there was any comparison between our military strengths but there just isn't.  Iran hated us before and they hate us still, now they have one less capable military leader to engage in hostilities with."
"Well before this, they weren't planning to get revenge on the US, that's for sure. They were even willing to, until recently, denuclearize in exchange for the removal of nuclear related sanctions from the US and the UN. But the recent killing of Soleimani prompted them to announce their withdrawal from the deal.
You also mentioned that we could just continue to assassinate Quds Force leaders. I don't think this will work out as smoothly as you think it will. Iran has nuclear weapons, and it doesn't matter which nation has more military strength if in the event of a war we are both blown to bits."
"No friend,  they do not have nuclear weapons.  They've been planning ""revenge"" against the U. S.  for decades. Seriously,  are people really so ignorant and easily lied to as to believe Iran has nuclear weapons?? What do you think the Iran Deal was supposed to be about? They also do not have ICBMS capable of delivering their nonexistent nuclear warheads to the United states. In a society dominated by fake news and misinformation you owe it to yourself to put a little more effort into researching things so you are better informed."
"Huh. You're right, they don't have nuclear weapons. I guess I got the wrong impression about what denuclearization meant: it implied the existence of WMDs in North Korea but I guess not for Iran. However that doesn't mean Iran doesn't have other ways of screwing us over (e.g. cyberattacks). I can't find any sources pointing towards the fact that ""Iran has been plotting revenge for decades"" other than that diplomatic relations ceased in 1980. Thanks for clearing things up."
"No problem. They’ve been chanting death to America for a long time. And our cyber capabilities are far superior to theirs. Google stuxnet and be amazed at what we did to them with the help of the Israelis. Plenty of advancements in cyberspace since then. Iran cannot match American superiority in any capacity, we don’t have to act like we’re handcuffed when dealing with them. We’ve shown an incredible amount of restraint in dealing with their hostilities and they’ve made the mistake of interpreting that as weakness. Many of our own less informed citizens have as well."
killing him was not the best move
good point.  The more terrorists left alive the better.
Sounds like a good thing to cross reference
They weren’t doing this before?!
"Oh those legal challenges by leftist dipshits: this administration does not have the right to use its current data on its citizens and non-citizens in a process that has the purpose to see who is actually in the country, right?"
That's great. I enjoy when things become backed by statistics
"I understand why a location may be allocated additional funds for citizens and legal/illegal immigrants.   However, I strongly object to the total number of citizens and legal/illegal immigrants being used to allocate representatives or Electoral College votes."
"For anyone unfamiliar with the Sikhs, they were originally a pacifist, syncretic, 15th century sect trying to reconcile Islam and Hinduism on the Indian sub-Continent, but were so brutally repressed by the Muslem rulers of India that they eventually developed a martial philosophy just to survive."
"Something that should be noticed by one and all.....Hindu-majority India currently has over 200 million Muslims and 20 million Sikhs living within its domains....while Muslim-majority Pakistan has today only a trace remnant of both Hindus and Sikhs. Why is that? At partition, there were millions of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan. Why were they all driven out? What does this tell us about the relative tolerance of India compared to Pakistan?....about the relative tolerance of a HIndu-majority society compared to a Muslim-majority society?"
Part of the Sikh Religon is carrying a ceremonial curved dagger because of long persecution by Islam
The Sikh religious crest also has 2 crossed scimitar like swords I believe for the same reason.
"The culprit <a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/ekh2ya/the_main_culprit_in_nankana_sahib_incident_imran/"">was arrested</a> and the PM <a href=""https://twitter.com/imrankhanpti/status/1213719619023884288?s=21"">has said</a> there'll be zero tolerance for actions like this. Things aren't great for minorities there but Imran Khan is dragging Pakistan into modernity and it's slowly getting better."
"Calling yourself a ""Religion of Peace"" is like CNN calling itself ""the most trusted name in news""  if you are pushing your own slogan that hard then  you know it ain't. "
"Looks at all the other religions which are ""religions of peace""  but they dont need to say it, they live it."
So much for that talk about cultural sites.
<strong>Article:</strong>
The Pentagon said it plans to send B-52 bombers and more troops to the Mideast as anger simmered Monday in Baghdad and Tehran over the U.S.’s targeted killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.
"Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Iran’s capital Monday in a funeral procession for Gen. Soleimani, the architect of deadly Iranian shadow wars throughout the Middle East. Many of the mourners called for revenge against the U.S."
"The drone strike last week ordered by President Trump set off a chain of events that saw Iraq’s parliament call for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country and a letter surface in which a U.S. general said American forces were preparing to pull out, quickly followed by a statement from top Pentagon officials that there were no plans to leave."
"World leaders, facing the prospect of a cycle of reprisals, pleaded for restraint. “Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century, and this turbulence is escalating,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said."
"A sobbing Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has promised “harsh revenge” for Gen. Soleimani’s killing, led the funeral prayers at Tehran University over his coffin, which arrived in Tehran late Sunday after being carried through the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad as part of a three-day mourning procession. People in the crowd cried as the ayatollah prayed."
"Before he was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on Friday, Gen. Soleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a role in which he oversaw foreign activities of Iran and its proxy forces. Those included a campaign that, according to the U.S., killed hundreds of U.S. and coalition soldiers in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003."
"His successor said Monday he would continue on Gen. Soleimani’s path. “The minimum retribution for us is to remove America from the region,” Brig. Gen. Esmail Qaani told state television."
"Baghdad has for years balanced simultaneous alliances with Tehran and Washington, but the killing there has strengthened Iran’s position in Iraq and thrown the U.S. presence in the country in doubt. On Sunday, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution to expel U.S. troops."
"A draft letter composed by a U.S. brigadier general circulated on Monday appeared to respond to that request, but Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the letter hadn’t been formally sent to Iraqi officials and was an “honest mistake.”"
"Over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the U.S. could target Iranian cultural sites if there is a conflict. Speaking to reporters Monday at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that the U.S. would “follow the rules of armed conflict,” which do not allow military strikes on such sites."
"The plans outlined Monday by the Pentagon call for about 200 members of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, based in Vicenza, Italy, to be sent to the Middle East."
"Some of those troops would be assigned to provide additional security to the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, a defense official said."
"They will join more than 10,000 U.S. troops who have been moved toward the Middle East or placed on alert since Gen. Soleimani was killed early Friday. Among them are about 5,000 Marines and sailors headed to the region aboard the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship, and its ready group, which includes the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit."
"Several hundred military personnel will be part of the deployment of a squadron of B-52 bombers, U.S. officials said. The U.S. had sent a group of B-52s to its air base in Qatar in 2019 during a flare-up of tensions with Iran, but eventually withdrew the aircraft. Six B-52s are being returned to the region in the coming days, the officials said."
"The new deployments will put the total number of U.S. troops, airmen and sailors in the Middle East at more than 80,000."
"The U.S. military is undertaking the deployments in response to vows by top Iranian officials and military leaders to seek revenge for last week’s U.S. airstrike. Iran, which has a sophisticated conventional military capacity, also has a network of allied militias and militant groups across the Middle East that could be enlisted by Tehran."
"On Monday the North Atlantic Treaty Organization offered support for the U.S. in the Middle East, calling on Iran to refrain from any actions that would destabilize the region. After an urgent meeting at alliance headquarters in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said allies expressed concerns about Iran’s activities in the region and strong support for the fight against Islamic State."
"“We are united in condemning Iran’s support of a variety of different terrorist groups,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “A new conflict would be in no one’s interest. So Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.”"
"The killing of Gen. Soleimani was “a U.S. decision,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “It is not a decision taken by the global coalition [against terrorism] nor NATO, “but all allies are concerned by Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region,” he added."
"Speaking at U.N. headquarters without referring to Gen. Soleimani’s killing, Mr. Guterres said: “My message is simple and clear. Stop escalation. Exercise maximum restraint. Restart dialogue. Renew international cooperation. Let us not forget the terrible human suffering caused by war.”"
"Monday’s crowd in Tehran, overwhelmingly religious and conservative in its appearance and chanting anti-U.S. slogans, was one of the largest to march in the Islamic Republic since the death of its founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989."
"“What the U.S. administration did planted hatred in the hearts of Iranians,” said Hossein Pourazar, a 34-year-old with a doctorate in civil construction who attended the Tehran procession. “Not toward the American people, but toward the administration because of the hostility it has toward our country and Islam.”"
"Alireza Rezaei, a 35-year-old businessman, said: “We are here to show our grief for a great man—a general to whom we owe our security. We are ready for everything, even war.”"
"That sentiment was echoed by Fatemeh Molla, an 18-year-old student. “The revenge should strike a blow to the U.S. so it doesn’t dare do such a thing against an Islamic country,” she said. “It should know that we will never back off.”"
"The mourning ceremonies are set to conclude Tuesday with the burial of Gen. Soleimani’s remains in his hometown, Kerman."
"After months of unrest in Iran in recent months, the processions were a remarkable display of national unity. Gen. Soleimani was considered a national hero by many Iranians, particularly for leading the country’s fight against Islamic State. Many marchers expressed anger at fresh threats by Mr. Trump to bomb 52 targets inside Iran, including sites of cultural importance."
"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday hit back at Mr. Trump by referring to the 1988 U.S. downing of a civilian Iran Air Flight 655, in which 290 people were killed. “Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655. Never threaten the Iranian nation,” Mr. Rouhani said on Twitter."
"As the vehicle carrying Mr. Soleimani’s coffin made its way through the crowds, people rubbed pieces of cloth and shirts on the casket. Some Shiites believe they can thus invoke a blessing from a holy martyr."
"On Sunday, Iran said it would no longer honor limits set in the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, which has been at risk of collapsing since Mr. Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from it in 2018."
"Iran didn’t specify how it might breach the limits of the deal, leaving several paths open. One could be to install a larger number of its centrifuges—machines that produce enriched uranium—which could by the summer allow Iran to reduce to less than six months the time it would need to amass enough nuclear fuel for one bomb, according to nuclear experts. Reinstalling all the roughly 13,000 centrifuges taken out under the nuclear deal could take a few years, however."
Iran said it would continue to give international inspectors access to its nuclear sites and would abide by some other restrictions in the agreement. It said it would return to honoring other aspects of the deal if the other parties secured Iran’s economic benefits.
"The European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, called a special meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers for Friday to discuss the crisis."
"France, Germany and the U.K., which with Russia and China remain parties to the nuclear deal, are unlikely to immediately trigger a dispute mechanism it sets forth unless the International Atomic Energy Agency documents a significant expansion in Iranian uranium production or centrifuge installation, diplomats said. Activating that mechanism would be the first step to a reimposition of international sanctions alongside those already imposed by the U.S."
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Monday evening a decision would be made on the dispute mechanism in the coming days.
Mr. Borrell said he deeply regretted Iran’s announcement and would rely on IAEA verification of any future Iranian steps.
"“Full implementation of #NuclearDeal by all is now more important than ever, for regional stability &amp; global security,” Mr. Borrell said on Twitter."
"Gen. Soleimani’s daughter, Zeynab Soleimani, speaking Monday at her father’s coffin and broadcast on state television, said the commander’s death would bring a “dark day” for the U.S. and called Mr. Trump a “toy in the hands of the Zionists.”"
"“Families of American soldiers in West Asia, who have witnessed America’s humiliation in wars in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Yemen and Palestine. will spend their days waiting for their children to die,” Ms. Soleimani said."
"Hell, George Lopez said he'd do it for half. "
​
"I guaran-damn tee you that if, God forbid, Trump, Pence, Pompeo, or some other Republican were assassinated, those in our country who were outraged over Suilemani's death will be dancing in the street. "
That's seriously the most dangerous thing about escalations with Iran- the fact that we have many gleeful traitors inside the gates already.
Golly I can only hope someone puts a bullet through trumps empty skull. Here's hoping for a long overdue presidential assassination.
I thought this was a joke at first.

The saddest thing of all is that they want to be right.  To spite Donald Trump.
Imagine being so detached from reality that you want your country to go to war just to prove your president wrong because your twitter politician told you so
Imagine inventing a caricature of the side you disagree with because you want to be outraged.
Now <em>this</em> is irony.
I call out the same stupid behavior on the left leaning subs. If I stated my sentence like so would it have pleased you?
This is an example of how both sides create caricatures of the side they disagree with because they want to be outraged.
You guys spend so much time pointing at the other side for throwing shit that you've completely lost sight that your hands are also covered in shit.
It's perfectly fine for a bystander to call out one side's ignorant logic and it not be irony just because they didn't include every other group that might have done the same. 
Whataboutism comes in all flavors I suppose.
If that's what you're calling whataboutism the meaning of the word has been completely lost. Whether something is hypocritical or whataboutism to you apparently depends entirely on whether or not you agree with the people making the assertion.
This is more ironic than most of your 80 upvoters know
I don’t think you know the definition of ironic.
"Yup. My wife is a leftist (don't ask), and yesterday says something to the effect of ""well your president is going to set off world war 3"" ""the man orchestrated an attack on an American embassy, which is an act of war itself, and is also responsible for over 600 American deaths."" ""I haven't heard that anywhere on the news."" ""Right, because the news hates the president."""
It's... It's a special time to live at my house.
"""I haven't heard that anywhere on the news."""
That's the teachable moment.
"Ooh, buddy, Godspeed during the next 4 years"
“Your president” our president.
"I gave up that argument a long time ago. TDS is very real, and I get to experience it if point that out."

Reddit is one massive contest to say something that draws attention. The very idea of orange man causes WWIII will make Reddit cream it’s pants whether or not it reflects reality in the slightest.
It’s what Reddit wants to happen so it’s “what’s happening”
Reddit found the Boston bomber because it wanted to.
"It wasn't the Boston bomber but that's okay, minor mistake."

"Reddit detectives from <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> sent death threats to the missing drowned mans mother."
"Bad thing is all of media, MS and social, want to benefit from it. So it is literally everywhere."
I think a good portion of the memes that come from this are not serious about the topic and are funny never the less.
"The stock market is flat since it happened. The people who are putting the money where their mouth is think it's no big deal and nothing big will happen. I mean, they might kill some American soldiers or launch a terrorist attack - which is terrible, but it's a far cry from WWIII. We're talking maybe dozens of deaths, not millions. Nothing that will even impact the economy in any way most likely. Trump doesn't get involved in all these expensive, never-ending regime change quagmires/adventures like W and Obama."
"That’s why I don’t even peep the homepage. I use Reddit to find cool shit, not to see a liberal fear mongering bias."

"Aaaaaahahahaha, better than the cartoon of the kid shoving a stick in his wheel spokes"
"This has been such a great last 6 months here on Reddit.  First their Tump/Russia collusion hoax was finally proven to be false, then their hero Mueller completely let them down, then their Impeachment totally fizzled (with Pelosi not even bothering to push it anymore) and now Trump actually stood up to Iran's BS instead of caving. They totally think that WW3 is going to start at any moment and it totally won't. Of course, none of this is going to give them pause.  They will just double down like always because when you are this self-righteous and your mind is already made up, damn the facts and any semblance of sanity."
"Yeah except they don't truly believe WWIII could happen here; they're fear-mongering; by definition, they know that fear isn't legitimate, or severely blown out of proportion, by themselves"
These same idiots then criticize Trump for not joining in Vietnam!
"Uhhh...yes. That’s kind of the point? We have a president that’s willing to draft dodge yet he might be inciting another world war? Don’t you see his pathetic hypocrisy? Trump won’t defend his country and yet he has no problem potentially sending thousands of Americans into harms way because he wants to show off his big, strong military to Putin."
"Yeah, the same could be said for every president in my life time. But you just changed the subject with breaking news!!! So Trump is now trying to intimidate or send signals to Putin? I thought he was Putin's puppet?"
Which other living president has literally dodged the draft?

No greater feeling than dropping off an infantry officer (and his men) that you knew back at the Naval Academy or at TBS then picking him back up a day or two later with all thumbs up and looks of relief on all the enlisted guys’ faces.

You disappear for flight school for two years and when you come back all those guys back from officer training have a deployment under their belt and a Combat Action Ribbon.

"While this is true, the memes are fantastic."
If reddit is the frontpage of the internet then the internet is a leftist propaganda machine.
Government workers have a lot of free time.
"Man my cousin I haven’t talked to in years messaged me worried they were going to call me back to service, both my daughters are worried WWIII is happening.  My ex wife messaged me to see if they could send me back.  The media is straight hot garbage."
"It is interesting because a civil war in the US is more likely with the proposed ""gun control laws"" that are going straight against the constitution, but democrats insist of even deploying the national guard in Virginia.  :P"
Governor Northam got the message. Their shitty bill will include a grandfather clause. He finally realized putting thousands of people in prison is a bad idea.
"He's still a shitbag, only backed down due to pressure, not because it was evil."
"First positive news I heard on that matter this far, thanks for sharing!"
"With that being said democrats still pushing on all fronts against the 2nd amendment, and if that is compromised the rest of the bill of rights is a goner."
Mao said that political power comes from the tip of a gun. They know this lesson well.
Good example of how well the citizens can hold their own leaders accountable when they've got nothing at their disposal to make the leadership reconsider their policies.

"That's unnecessarily gross mental imagery. Not saying I agree with this ""logic,"" but statements like this are probably why liberals go and make claims that people who don't like the LGBT agenda are closeted."
"Either way, what the Democrats are doing here with Iran is disgusting though, agreed"
"That was homophobic?  I only said cock because the Ayatollah is a male.  Either way, they are pleasuring him at our expense. Sad."
"I agree that this sexual humiliation stuff is disgusting, that's just what happens when a space is dominated by young men unfortunately. I still have to say I see way less of it here than the mountains of it they write over at r.politics. Just read any thread there about Trump and Putin, which because of their unique mental disorder over there somehow manages to be most of them."
Nothing about that comment had anything to do with the LGBT agenda and only bad actors would ever even think that. No one here should police their speech just so some crazies who hate anyone who isn't them have less ammo against us. They are going to make up shit no matter what.
but statements like this are probably why liberals go and make claims that people who don't like the LGBT agenda are closeted.
Huh. Imagine how hilarious it would be if it turned out LGBT people were <em>persecuting themselves</em> this whole time.

Exactly my thoughts. And these little pebbles can end up making huge waves that nobody intended. But I'm glad they pushed the button on that dude. 
The whole region has been bubbling with low key conflict for years now. I feel like something has to break loose eventually.
I can't see the Chinese getting involved because of the trade deal situation
We brought them too their knees economically speaking. 
So they want this desperately.
Russia in the other hand had a bad fire on its Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier a couple weeks ago so I can't see them posing a major threat from a naval standpoint.

Judges are basically basing bond on the price you post to the bondsman instead of what's ACTUALLY the case which is what a regular person would be able to post to get out of prison before trial. 
"20 years ago I had a bond which was the maximum legal possible because I was assaulted by a marine staff Sargent in a bar. They fled the scene and I stuck around because I didn't do anything wrong, they arrested me and because it was a holiday weekend I stayed in jail for days before the magistrate set my bond at the maximum level they could. "
"I couldn't afford to post $5,500 in bond so my family had to pay out $550 they will never recover. The judge dismissed the trial with prejudice, we never saw a courtroom. The bondsman profited by making $550 and my family was never compensated for any of it, the Marine was demoted and never faced trail. "
Who won? The bondsman won
"So, it's not the bond system that's messed up. It's the judge that's the problem. Good thing Trump is solving that issue, too."
"No, it's the bond system which sets a massive bond level for someone based on the whim's of a local magistrate. Trump can't do anything about this shit and your abuse of the downvote system proved you've got a real problem with facts buddy. Dislike isn't a downvote, don't be a fucking libtard."
"Oh, boo hoo. I downvoted you. Oh, how sad! Do you realize what sub you're on right now?"
I down voted 'it' as well

I hope the chip is gone and that today's better.

"With the recent federal law banning sale of tobacco to people under 21, our drinking age at 21, handguns at 21, and many states now looking to move to 21 for any firearms:"
"What is your position on just moving the age of adulthood to 21 for everything? Meaning joining the military, or being sent to prison as an adult? Potentially voting as well but that would need an amendment."
"I think it's terrible that we can charge someone as an adult for underage possession of tobacco, because we are simultaneously saying:"
"You are adult enough to know the consequences of your actions, but not the consequences of smoking.'"
Similarly with firearms and the military we seem to say:
You are not adult enough to be responsible with a shotgun to hunt ducks. But hey here's a machine gun as long as you can only shoot foreigners.
"T21 is a terrible idea. It allows the government to arbitrarily decide who gets what at what age. So, you can have sugar at this age, but tobacco at this age, but vote at this age, but kill (or be killed) for the government at this age, but be married at this age... except when you do something we hate, then we can punish you like an adult even if you are 16 or 17.  As a society, we have made us (and our children) less individualistic and more dependent and childlike for decades. This has all been in the name of safety. This is the consequence. We need to decide what an adult is and stick to it. Is that 18, 19, 20 or 21? That is NOT perfect, but it is the best we can do as a society."
"Thanks for the answer, and a follow up if you don't mind:"
"From personal experience I believe it should be 21. I know myself at 18, and I made some very bone headed decisions at that age, some of which impacted my life for many years after."
"Versus at 21 while I still made some bone headed moves, I feel like I had a much greater respect for long-term consequences."
"But I'm interested in hearing what you think it should be, especially since your experience with joining the military is the opposite of mine (I considered it but ultimately chose not to)."
"I haven't given this much thought. My gut says 19, just to have some experience outside of high school, time to make your first mistake. But that is a knee-jerk reaction. I'd need to ponder on the ramifications more."
I'd say age is an arbritrary nonsense thing to use.  
"It seems pretty clear, that what 'age' is supposed to measure is ""level of maturity / being able properly understand consequences"".   "
"Yet, I know 15 year olds, that are way more mature, and know the consequences of their actuions better than many 30+ year olds.  "
"How are we ever supposed to argue that Age even makes sense, since it doesn't actually measure these things.  "
"Many disabled people are over 21, but still need other people to make most of their decisions."
"If there is another way to measure, I'm all in. I personally don't know of one. The reason why we argue that age makes sense, is that it has been a cultural answer and it's currently the best way most people know. Then, we look at exceptions, like those disabled. This is absolutely not perfect. I'm open to another way."
"I too, also don't know of a better way."
"I just also think any argument for the age of consent being X, that is based on ""level of maturity / being able properly understand consequences"" just can't ever be made, since it makes no logical sense."
"Saying it has been the 'cultural answer' makes the most sense in terms of why it is the way it is now, and why it's currently being used."
"But any argument of changing it to 21, or 19, or anything that hasn't been the culturally accepted 18 (basically around the world) has to come from a better angle, than ""age = maturity"", because otherwise, the argument would be completely flawed, and make no sense."
"also as an asside. If 18 is the age of consent, then why are children allowed to go to the shops and consent to buying candy alone?"
"I like your reasoning, but even more I like that you admit it's knee-jerk."
"Personally I have a great respect for people who admit when they don't actually know something and admit they need time to think on it and research more. Versus how many would just try to BS an answer so they seem infallible. Too few politicians these days are willing to say ""I think this, but I'm not completely sure and need to research it more""."
"A sign of a great leader is knowing their limitations, thanks for the answers :D"
"When two parties (Democratic and Republican) have controlled everything about government for decades, including who can compete against themselves in government, they've had a lot of time to build their roadblocks to anyone who wants to do things differently. What ideas do you have for competing parties like the Libertarian Party, to get our people into office and ideas into practice?"
"The most important thing in today's America is popularity! We simply need to become more popular. Once the individuals in positions of authority realize that they may actually be voted out, they will change. Because they control most mainstream media, we will need to grow via social media, like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. That is one of the reasons why I'm sitting here doing this on a Sunday. I hope others will follow my example."
What about ranked choice voting? How do you feel about that? Do you feel it would help or hurt? And why?
LOVE the idea. We have it in a minor way now in NYC. I hope it grows.
"For the love of liberty, Larry, <em>please</em> allow me to convince you why that non-reform is <em>horrible</em> and can only hurt us."
Go ahead. I'm here all day. :)
The fundamental problem with RCV is that it's nothing but iterated FPTP.
"When you were on the campaign trail, you no doubt encountered lots of Republicans that thought you were better than His Majesty, but still preferred the Republican, right?  And Democrats who (for some unfathomable reason) preferred His Majesty to you, but liked what you were saying? "
"With that non-reform, you don't get credit for <em>any</em> of that.  You could be the 1st or 2nd choice of every single voter in the race, but unless you were in the Top Two in the first round of counting, that wouldn't matter; the method iteratively eliminates candidates from consideration, looking at who each ballots' favorite is at that point.  "
"If we can't get more first preference votes than the Republican or Democrat, we'll lose before anyone even <em>considers</em> whether we should win."
"But what if you surpass one of the two parties?   Well, that's almost <em>worse,</em> because what ends up happening there is that candidate is eliminated, and unless you get the majority of the later preferences, you end up losing to the candidate least like you."
"This isn't conjecture, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election#Analysis_of_the_2009_election"">it's actually happened</a>"
"And <em>because</em> of that problem, voters <em>still</em> feel they have to vote for an ""electable"" candidate, which leads to continued two-party dominance, such as <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/VblDjCu.png"">we see in the Australian House of Representatives</a>"
"...and worse, <em>because</em> the Parties know that they will <em>eventually</em> get later preference votes, they become <em>less</em> responsive to the voters."
"On the other hand, with something like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3GFG0sXIig"">Score Voting</a> (think GPA/Product Ratings for Candidates) or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orybDrUj4vA"">Approval</a> (the Pass/Fail version), if the entire electorate agrees that you're worth electing, <em>you get elected.</em> "
"That allows multiple candidates to be on the ballot at the same time without splitting the vote (because whether a voter gives His Majesty an A or an F has no bearing on <em>your</em> GPA, only his).    On the other side of the coin, a vote for you would never be ""wasted,"" because voting for you doesn't stop them from expressing their preferences on the rest of the candidates."
"That means that, unlike under that non-reform, under Score/Approval, questions of ""Electability"" become irrelevant, which in turn means that you can campaign, and <em>win,</em> on merit."
"And if you want a longer version, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag0eYv748yM&amp;t=1s"">here's a presentation someone gave to the King County, Washington LP</a>"
I will have to read this after the AMA and get back to you. Thank you for the details.
Of course!  It's a lot to process; I only know as much as I do about this because I've been working this problem for about a decade now.
"I was proud to vote for you and I'm glad to be working with Kari on building the LP in NY in hopes that someday we'll go from an authoritarian state to a Libertarian state, your hard work spreading the message is greatly appreciated."
"One of my biggest problems with the Libertarian Party is, quite frankly, the fringes of the movement are kind of dragging us down and I was wondering how you would help people realize that we're not the party of creepy pervs and weird racists. IOW : how would you improve the Libertarian Party's curb appeal?"
"Yes. The Libertarian Party has some bad cultural aspects. We've been losing for 40 years, so many people have left, leaving mostly the diehards who are often angry. The answer is to bring more people in. The Rs and Ds have, jerks too.  Just percentage=wise, they seem smaller. How do we do that? NOT by spouting theory! But, instead by providing Libertarian Leaning answers for their actual problems. Abolish X doesn't solve someones problem, therefor they will believe abolishing X is dumb or irrelevant. It doesn't matter if abolishing X is actually a good idea or not.  However, if we have a plan that helps them, that may include abolishing or diminishing X,... all good. I will often work a room to get the worries and concerns of the audience and then when I speak, I give them my solutions to the problems I heard. It works very well."
"How do we [bring more people into the party]? NOT by spouting theory! But, instead by providing Libertarian Leaning answers for their actual problems"
"Amen! How do we spread this message across the party!? I feel like this is the linch pin to being taken seriously, nationally, locally and at our local watering holes"
I keep doing it. I hope my example gets more people to follow. Here and on as much social media as I can.  Thank you.
"How do you feel about the ""Unshackle Upstate"" movement?"
"As a resident of upstate NY many of us feel that the state is completely railroaded by New York City and we are just dragged along kicking and screaming. We feel like we have no voice because NYC just drowns us out, we're effectively ruled by people who don't care what we want, and have nothing in common with us other than being looped together by a 250 map."
Is there a better way to resolve the imbalance in power other than splitting the state?
"Unshackle will not happen because of the political and financial ties within the state. The best answer is what I campaigned on... home rule. Counties need MUCH more autonomy. Less money going to Albany first, means less control by Albany. Removing unfunded mandates also means less control. No more Empire Development Corporation ALSO mean less control. If we would just let counties be counties, let Watertown be Watertown and Brooklyn be Brooklyn, we wouldn't have this animosity."
"☝🏻 YES! As a Rochesterian, I would love to see some balance between Upstate/WNY and NYC."
What are your thoughts of ubi?
"I have very different views on theory and in practice. In <strong>theory</strong>, UBI is fine. It would be an amount that any individual (not family) could survive on (not thrive) and that every adult (no matte what) gets every month. Maybe somewhere between $2,500 and $3,500? I don't know the actual number. It would replace ALL other forms of public assistance: No more disability, welfare, unemployment insurance, social security, food stamps, VA benefits, etc..  People who want to have more would get jobs and make more money (they still get UBI).  Rich people could give theirs away of they want, because even billionaires get it. In <strong>theory</strong> this would still be a massive savings just in personnel and infrastructure. No more paperwork and bureaucracy!  And people would be free to do what moves them with reduced consequences. However, <strong>in practice</strong> UBI would be a disaster and a terrible idea! 1 - There would immediately be carve outs for special interests (I have 4 kids, or I'm a clergyman, or I'm a veteran or I.... so I need more $) because that's how politicians gain votes and donations. Which means we'd create a new infrastructure anyway to administer all the exceptions! 2 - It would deepen the divide between haves and havenots as the savvy vie to get the monthly stipends (we see this already with the grab for settlement payouts) . In addition, the poor will surely mortgage there monthly checks away to the wealthy (we see it already with payday loans) . 3 - We set up an environment of not having to work. Think of how it feels as a kid to NEVER see your parents go off to work? To never have an culture of ""earn it"".  4 - We increase the validity of ""big brother"" always looking out for us. This would destroy our culture."
Your UBI in Theory sounds a lot like FairTax where everyone gets a prebate and all other public assistance is removed.  Is FairTax something you support?
I'm open to the idea of Fair Tax.
"A little off topic, but: Larry you seem to have a good heart and a sound, thoughtful mind. You speak from a foundation of appealing to reason, which is unlike most politicians who speak with appeal to emotion and to buzzwords. Just please keep fighting for the future of America -- for what makes us great: our liberty, justice and opportunity. These are what has transformed the world for humanity in recent history. Some of us, like me, are quiet, but we are being given hope and inspiration by people like you. The pragmatism-meets-libertarianism you offer may not be as popular nor ideal as Ron-Paul-libertarianism, but it may be more successful--I hope."
"Hi Larry,"
"I work in the NYS Legislature, my question is related to the Senate going blue in the last election and 2019 being dominated by a fully Democratic executive and legislative agenda. How do you see the Libertarian party responding to this new New York reality of an increasingly even more intrusive state government? Also a would you consider running for Senate or Assembly in the future?"
"The ONLY hope to break the Democrat Monopoly in NYS is the Libertarian Party. Republicans are leaving the state in droves so the R party just gets smaller and smaller. I think it's 3 - 1 now. Democrats in NY will not vote for Rs and Republicans will not vote for Ds.  But, both will vote for an L. We've seen that multiple times in 2018 and 2019. The answer is more Ls at the state level so that we can create Liberty Coalitions from each side on critical issues like Local Control, The Budget, 2A, Prison Reform, Farm Reform, Cannabis Reform etc..  No, I will not run for local office. My job is top of the ticket to motivate others to run and win. That is what I did in 2018 so that we got victories in 2019.  A few years ago in NJ, someone asked me what movie archetype I am.  I said, I'm Obi Wan Kenobi. I die fighting Darth Vader so the rest of the rebels can win. :)"
"As a newer libertarian,  one thing I've noticed is that the libertarians cant seem to agree on anything, if one has a different view they call each other fake libertarians,  statists, fascists, and even commies. How are you going to overcome this and try to bring them together and agree on something ?"
"Yes, the central piece in the party is non-violence unless there is a victim (and government is also violence).  That's really the core. So, regardless of your social outlook, we can work together as long as you don't want  force your way on others. That means we will disagree A LOT. In addition, we are a growing party. That means many people are just dipping their toe in the pool. Of course they are not ""real"" libertarians. So, what! That 's how we grow. Please try to ignore the jerks in the party. As we grow there will be fewer of them and they won't be as loud. Let's just respect each other and eventually we'll be able to work together on an issue by issue basis, And I'm good with that. Thank you for your patience."
"Also, please see my response t AF86 above."
What are your thoughts about what seems to be a growing political divide in our country?
​
"I'm only 32, and maybe it was youthful optimism, but it seems like a decade ago both D's and R's wanted what they thought was best for our country and would work together to get it."
​
"But now it seems like they exist purely to combat each other. This divide is what drove me to seek out 3rd parties like the libertarians, because I was sick of the two main parties putting more effort into bashing each other, than into helping us."
"Very true. The only answer is a party that can accept you WITHOUT having to convert you. That is us.  After 2020, whether Trump wins or loses, half of the country s going to believe that our President is illegitimate. Where will those people go? Many will want to either resort to violence or just check out. We need to be there for them.   <a href=""https://youtu.be/wYcFstPXc0U?t=29"">https://youtu.be/wYcFstPXc0U?t=29</a>"

"Thank you for your response, I liked it."
"Thank you so much for taking the time to answer some questions. I did a good amount of research into your policies for the last NYS governor election. I know it’s a little bit out, but if/when you run again how can someone like myself help with your campaign?"
"If I run again in 2022, I would announce in late 2021. At that time please reach out via social media and my team will take over from there. Thank you for your support."
"Hello,"
Thanks for doing this AMA! Two questions:
"First, you mention ""facilitating innovative non-taxpayer funding."" I'm curious about what this means, as it could cover everything from state-owned assets to public-private partnerships."
"Second, you also mention ""eliminating tolls."" As someone who hates toll roads, this is very interesting to me; however, there would be a variety of legal and practical challenges in doing so, not the least of which would be increased costs to taxpayers. How can we eliminate tolls without unduly burdening taxpayers who don't use those roads?"
Thanks and good luck!
"I don't talk about Privatization for many reasons. 1 - It scares people. 2 - We've paid for the assets so why give them away. 3 - If I just sell off/give away a monopoly is STILL have a monopoly!  My goal has always been to create more choice and allow for growth and better value. Leasing naming rights to infrastructure allows for companies to compete for the rights gaining maximum non-tax payer revenue on an ongoing basis.  In addition, since we retain the asset, we can continue inspections with contractual consequences which means safer infrastructure. With maintenance and costs being paid for, there is no need for tolls. If private companies then decide to build infrastructure for the State so that they can have naming right in perpetuity, we can facilitate, that too. Better, safer infrastructure without more taxes or tolls."
"Larry,"
What is the best strategy for the Libertarian Party to eventually start winning seats in Congress and possibly the presidency one day?

"Out of all your campaign issues posted I'm most intrigued about ""saving Main Street,"" can you expand a bit on what this entails?"
Cheers
This is about supporting small business (and small farms:
Reducing licensing requirements for individual professionals 
Addressing small business insurance issues
Removing federal regulations for local sellers
No more bribing big businesses to come to town and destroy local economies
I hope that was clear.
"Hi Larry,"
What are your thoughts on the Mises Caucus lighting a spark in the party today and the impact of Tom Woods/Scott Horton/Dave Smith on the face of the party in 2020?
I'm happy to see it. They all have different audiences and can bring more people and vale to the party. I'm glad to have them.
How do you convince people to vote libertarian when many people (dems &amp; repubs) think taxes are necessary and the federal government should be doing some things that libertarians want to abolish?
"Instead of talking about abolishing, I talk about solving problems with libertarian answers. I create real life policies that help people without more taxes and without force. This is difficult, but possible. "
"Also, see my response to AF86 above."
Is there going to be a serious Libertarian candidate in the special election for Chris Collins’ seat? Anyone in the state is eligible to run for it; would you consider doing so?
"Currently the LP has Duane Whitmer running for that seat. He was on my campaign in 2018. (Please see the question above) He does weekly update via social media. Please check him out and challenge him to see if he's the candidate that you seek. <a href=""https://duanewhitmer.com/"">https://duanewhitmer.com/</a>"
"What do you think it will take for anyone in either major party to take seriously the idea of cutting spending and curtailing the national debt? It's common knowledge that Bill Clinton ran a fairly well fiscally balanced government (at least by current standards) and Trump is currently spending at astronomical levels. Both parties have essentially abandoned the idea of fighting the debt because it is unpopular, which is greatly disappointing to me. Do you forsee any certain event or trends that could cause this to become a mainstream issue again?"
"Yes. Once a state goes bankrupt. Within the next few years, one of our states will have to default and basically go into Federal receivership. Once that happens, we can have a real national conversation again. Because before that actually happens, that state's government employees and pensioners will not get paid. Once cops, firefighters and retirees get no pay, watch the news pick up story after story. Sadly, I think this is our only answer. Before that, distraction (The Middle East, Ukraine, China, etc...) will get the best of us."
It's already sort of happening on a local level. Newburgh just recently laid off fireman and police in order to balance their budget.
Exactly.
"Hey Mr. Sharpe, "
First off glad to have you on and thanks for doing this!
My question has to do with the second amendment and Virginia.
"If you're not familiar these counties have passed measures or laws stating that they will not enforce any state wide gun control laws, and some have gone so far as to ""Promise to defend the rights of their citizens""."
"Hey ATF - Sanctuary Cities/Counties are great ways for ""non-compliance"". They also reinforce the ideas and values of more localized control and shine a light on the true diversity of our nation. I'm in."
Awesome glad to hear it! One of the things I loved when listening to you was you were the only candidate who said:
"Local governments should tell me what they need, and I will work to help them with their goals"
Versus so many other politicians who seem to have a position of:
I know best and will dictate my views to others.
"Yes. We need government to be more like the fire department. Call me when you need me and I'll come running. Otherwise, I'm just here to give to tips on safety.  :)"
"Mr. Sharp, thank you for taking the time doing this."
What is your thoughts on Trump's recent declaration that he will be attacking Islamic points of culture and innocent people?
"This is such a terrible idea. Hardcore Trump supporters often get mad at me whenever I say anything bad about Trump. So, they'll probably be mad at me now. But Trump is just a man who does good and bad things. This is a bad one! The Iranian people are again angry at their government and we then decide to give them something to unite over. Boo! Imagine if some big power like Russia or China threatened to bomb Mount Rushmore or The Grand Canyon or Saint Patrick's Cathedral or The Statue of Liberty, etc..  We'd lose our collective minds. We are just fueling the fire and soon more American military will be dead because of it."
"SIDE NOTE: Maybe our young servicemen should all start smoking so they can be arrested and not be sent to fight in a foreign Civil War. Our government seems to think if you are 19, it's OK for us to decide you should be hurt in a war, but you can't decide to be hurt by smoking."
Im curious about what would you consider the best things trump has done and worst.  Has trump accomplished things that would be considered libertarian?
"Hi Larry,"
"You've discussed how many decades of government policy Band-Aids have stacked on one another, such that we can't just rip them all off at once, but need to provide libertarian solutions to them gradually. This is a key issue within the Libertarian Party, as purists berate that compromising approach as sacrificing core libertarian values, but it reduces party growth with others."
How do you see the party moving forward with this split between compromise vs holding to our core beliefs?
"I just keep providing answers for people's problems. They vote for us and we get change. Whoever wants to berate and fight, OK... oh well.  I have a movement to advance."
"Hi Larry,"
Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. I'm happy to have donated and voted for your last campaign. You're an important voice in the liberty movement and I hope you continue to grow in popularity.
"My question is in regards to climate change. I believe that climate change is real and that human activity contributes significantly to that change. The mainstream thought from both economists and environmentalists advocate a carbon tax. I've recently come around to endorsing this idea myself. A carbon tax and dividend system (it has to be a revenue neutral dividend) I think is compatible with the  Libertarian philosophy, as dealing with negative externalities is one of the few things I'm ok with governments being involved with handling. Would you also endorse a carbon tax as a way of combating climate change?"
"I'm not a carbon tax fan. This will be used just as another revenue source (used in the general fund) and will be eventually corrupted into a buy and sell stock market style scheme that then becomes part of our economy for the wealthy.  I'd rather just try to create an environment that encourages us to fix the problems. As you probably know there are many issues here, but too big ones are food and energy. Why aren't we reducing the barriers to entry for companies with new lab food sources? Or why aren't we allowing the NRC to let states that want it, take up new nuclear technology? I just grabbed two random ideas (our of many possible) that require NO new taxes and allow people to voluntarily take major steps. This is the way. Not taxes."
"I appreciate the response. I would also be concerned about a carbon tax being used for the general fund (the yellow vest movement should be a lesson to the world), but the dividend system would get around that problem if implemented properly. When you responded to a question about UBI, you said it sounded great in theory, but not in practice. Would your concern to a carbon tax be similar? That a legislative body would eventually remove the dividend provision or water it down and render it ineffective? Because carbon tax and dividends, when implemented, have reduced carbon output AND actually increased disposable income for low and middle class families when factoring in energy rate increases."
"I agree that lab food sources and nuclear are 2 great ideas, but those also have some problems in terms of timeliness. Lab grown food requires change in consumer preferences, consumers are notoriously picky and stubborn to change, and the change we would want to see would take many years. Same goes for Nuclear. There are fears about another Chernobyl and Fukushima (I think those fears are unfounded based on modern day technology and regulations in place), but nonetheless they do exist. They are also very time consuming to build (10+ years). The time to act on climate change is ASAP to limit warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius before 2100. The carbon tax and dividend (again I just want to re-emphasize how important the dividend aspect of this is, I know us libertarians hate taxes lol) I still strongly believe is the most effective way to implement change right now. I would hope that you may eventually reconsider. But I again thank you for your time and your answer. Maybe we can talk more about this on The Sharpe Way sometime :)"
"Yes, the implementation is my biggest worry. "
"Even a Carbon Tax would take years to implement (even if done well) because we don't have anywhere near on consensus on the basics or the details yet. And then even more years for people to adopt it and to see results. No matter what, we are screwed. I prefer what I posted  because I believe it sets us up to fix whatever issues happen in the future."

Hi Larry!
"I'm one of the 90,816 that filled in that bubble on the Libertarian row for you in 2018. You talked about a lot of things that the city-types running didn't even think of, that earned you a lot of respect up north. I have three questions for you:"
"1- We had may local victories in NYS in 2019. We have many of my ideas being implemented/looked at (Sanctuary 2A counties, revamping the Erie Canal, etc.. ) . We are winning."
"2 - Localization! Some counties don't want a lot of freedom, others only want certain freedoms. Let each be each. "
3 - We have better infrastructure than ever and we'll have even more local wins.
Hi Mr. Sharpe. Thank you so much for your dedication to the liberty movement. You are the best liberty orator since Ron Paul. 
<strong>Please run for president.</strong> The libertarian candidates this year lack the skills that you have to explain the libertarian message to the masses.
"Like you said in NY, even if you don't win, the country will change because of your message, just like NY is adopting some of your policies now.   I am certain that if you run you can get the libertarian party over the 5% hurdle. The country will see the libertarian party differently. The US needs you more than ever, break that hole through the wall and everyone will follow!"
"Thank you so much for the kind words. We need more infrastructure and talent. I'm doing my best with my limited resources (I went 18 months without a salary when I ran in 2017-1028) to help build that. This movement can't be the Larry Sharpe Show (There already is a Larry Sharpe show: <a href=""https://sharpeway.com/"">The Sharpe Way</a> ). Others have to step up, too. I'm trying to support that. Maybe 2024."
"What are your thoughts on the laws regarding pornography of children, like possession and distribution?"

"What are your thoughts about speed limits on highways? Its only purpose is to generate revenue from tickets, and our officers could be spending their time doing something more constructive. Especially since most people disregard it altogether and follow the speed of traffic instead."
"Residential speed limits are different as the safety of the people living there comes into play, but highways don't have this issue."
"Speed limits should be local, not federal. The goal should be local safety, not revenue, therefore speed traps (made for revenue collection) should be illegal (unethical). With cameras so prevalent, we can simply use police vehicle dashboard cams as evidence of reckless speeding/driving. Punish those who are being reckless, not those who break an arbitrary limit that most people ignore anyway."

"Hi Larry,"
"Now that the latest economic research has shown pretty conclusively that raising the minimum wage doesn't have any real negative impact (among other things, because labor markets at the low end are rife with serious imperfections like monopsony and because bargaining power disparities are so huge the take-it-or-leave-it offer is basically at bare survival levels), would you be fine with raising the minimum wage a few dollars an hour nationally?"
"<a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w25434"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nber.org/papers/w25434</a> and other stuff Dube has worked on are great, current papers for this."
No. Having a minimum wage hurts bargaining power because it sets an arbitrary bottom. It also has the government set value on labor. It also assumes that people want/should work for an hourly wage when all the data shows that's the most common way of the working poor (except for government employees) and this type of employment is going away as automation moves in. This is true even in more highly educated professional industries like law and finance.  That makes it a backward industrial age idea.
"Have you read or engaged with any of the recent economic literature on the subject? It is directly at odds with your statement that it ""hurts bargaining power"", unless you mean to say that a rigged game in favor of employers is good but redressing market defects through regulation is bad. I do not like monopsonistic markets any more than monopolistic ones!"
"Also, as far as automation is concerned, productivity growth has been around 2% for years now, far less than the rates in the 1960s and 70s. Where is this sudden unemployment crisis due to automation coming from if it cannot be detected in the productivity data?"
Trying to redress via regulation usually fails because the regulations are usually written by corporate lobbyists and even then then they are litigated by corporate lawyers. They end up being barriers to entry and/or pillars of an oligarchy or monopoly.  The damage that has come and is about to come is hard to find because the data collected is from the industrial age. 
I can find the damage in a few odd bits of data:
80% of all new jobs n the US come from 20 cities. 
1% of US counties count for 30% of all productivity.
"(These two stats have been getting worse, especially since 2008. I would argue that they indicate that huge chunks of America have little or no recovery/growth.)"
About 1/3 of working Americans are responsible in some way for their commercial real estate decisions.  
"Executive Suites and shared work spaces have been exploding (we Work, Regus, etc...)"
"""Side Hustle"" jobs (Uber, delivery, handy man, etc..) have been exploding, also. And they're becoming more mainstream and less side hustle. "
"According to the US Society for Human Resources Management, age description is at its highest pint ever. "
According to the IRS the amount of LLCs has continued to expand at a higher rate than before 2008.
(I would argue that these five points indicate severe underemployment in the gig economy. This wouldn't be shown necessarily in productivity or unemployment data.)
"But even if all of this is wrong or my interpretation is off, economies also run on confidence and emotion. I have traveled my state and the nation for the last few years.  People feel left behind. That, in itself, has some impact.  That won't be fixed by minimum wage. That is only fixed by belief in opportunity."
Trying to redress via regulation usually fails because the regulations are usually written by corporate lobbyists and even then then they are litigated by corporate lawyers. They end up being barriers to entry and/or pillars of an oligarchy or monopoly
"This can't just be asserted. No doubt it's a problem, but so are network and first-mover effects that can be entrenched entirely free of government involvement. Even if market defects are resolved in the long term, they can be quite destructive in the medium term, and regulatory capture aside we have had decades in our past where regulation on key industries worked reasonably well (if even just anti-monopoly statutes that limited the damage). I haven't seen any study that says regulation ""usually"" fails or what that means. I'm hardly pro-State, but I recognize how anti-competitive and destructive market actors can be when left to their own devices. The best way to make a dollar in the absence of a good regulatory structure has always been to trick and defraud the customer (or shareholder), which is why Bitcoin markets were insanely fraudulent from top to bottom."
"I have traveled my state and the nation for the last few years. People feel left behind. That, in itself, has some impact. That won't be fixed by minimum wage. That is only fixed by belief in opportunity."
"Why would anyone believe in opportunities that clearly only exist for the upper-middle class and above? That is a pretty rational belief for many as you point out. At least a higher minimum wage will put food on the table, belief or not."
"If you can't see that the most highly regulated markets are all oligarchies, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree."
"Yes, we need to create an environment AND belief that opportunities are NOT just for upper middle class and above. The current system, especially in New York, is exactly that. Making wage slavery a little more tolerable (raising minimum wage) is not an answer. "
"The ""at least"" attitude is the beginning of the end. It's a cop-out and doesn't fix problems. It validates them. Here is my view on poverty and how I would make it better for everyone from a talk I did at Queens College last year:  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Sharpe4Gov/videos/280997312807272/"" rel=""nofollow"">Larry Sharpe on Poverty</a>"
"At best you can say that since government provides the conditions for capitalism to function (through backstopping private property laws, bankruptcy court and dispute resolution, contract law, and forming a ""reservoir of trust"" of various sizes that give people faith enough in the institutions of capitalism to be able to go out and engage with it without being defrauded), the necessary condition for not only oligarchy and monopoly to exist, but more smoothly functioning market organizations has been fulfilled. The sufficient conditions for both we can disagree on, but it's hard to get away from that premise, especially since there is no serious historical counter-example of a flourishing, widespread market system that is not backstopped by a government-like entity with those powers, in particular in the modern era."
"Put briefly: no government, no real market society at all (and the more complex the market society, the larger the baseline role of government), so if you believe government is behind the creation of anti-competitive firms, there's not really an alternative but to regulate in some fashion. There are certainly bad regulations but I think there's also been good ones, and they weren't complicated - the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for example. Originally just a few pages I believe. So when you say ""Making wage slavery a little more tolerable (raising minimum wage) is not an answer"", I agree it ultimately isn't much of an answer at all, but I support it because the short-term alternative is not a utopia, it's a further degradation of economic conditions for a large chunk of the country, and because the bulk of the latest econometric and empirical studies have shown that it is a net benefit for low-wage workers. Ultimately market systems (except in periods of systemic and deep regulation) have tended to concentrate capital into a few hands which leaves almost everyone dependent on wage labor, and even taking into account life-cycle effects it seems a enormous amount of people are stuck in badly functioning lower wage labor markets."
"I tend to not have the patience to sit through 80 minute talks without a summary, but if you've written about poverty somewhere I'd happily read that."
How many genders are there?
However many you like and I will NOT judge you for whatever answer you have. This is not a big concern of mine.
"While I appreciate the response, I do feel saddened that even a politician on the fringes of the mainstream cannot bring himself to give a real answer out of fear of losing support for doing so."
"Was that not a real answer? Let me be clearer - This is only an issue if you make it one. Let people be who they want to be and move on.  This doesn't need to be distraction. And that what it is now. If you say 2, good. Now, let's fix this country. If you say 58 (I think that's the new Facebook amount), good. Now, let's fix this country. I hope that was a real answer."
"I'm afraid the above is just another way of saying ""I'm not going to answer your question""."
"You're right that there are more pressing issues in America than the subject of my question, but I didn't ask you about those because you don't know how to fix them; no one does. You're not going to fix entitlements or foreign policy because you happen to have some magic plan no one's thought of. "
The most I can ask from a president is that he surround himself with smart knowledgeable people who can help him find ways to use his office to make politically viable changes in (what I consider to be) the right direction.
"And that has to start with someone with the moral courage to acknowledge the world as it is; if you cannot win over the electorate by agreeing that the sky is blue, I don't see how you'd be able or willing to convince them of much else."
"Unless you actually believe there are 58 genders, in which case, I probably don't want you in that office anyways. (nothing against the people who identify in the 56 other ways, but I don't think reality works that way)"
"If you want to give me a satisfactory answer, just pick one of the two options below:"
A) there are two genders
B) there are more than two genders
"Just for clarity, I don't fear losing support. I'm clearly losing you. If this is your issue and you believe that everything else I say, think and am capable of relies on this one issue, I understand. That's your right and I respect that. I'm sorry to lose you. I hope you'll come back."
When are you going to do the smart thing and move out of new York?
I hope never. I want to fix my state.
"I admire your determination. You are one of the very few campaigns I've ever donated to, and even though you didn't win, I consider it money well spent. Best of luck in the future...do you have any other offices in New York that you are looking at going for?"
"Thank you for the support. I may run again for Governor in 2022. Until then, I intend to help others."
Where do you stand on a national constitutional carry law?
"Please Google ""Larry Sharpe 2nd Amendment"""
Hi! What is your stance on welfare?
Obvious.
"Why do you believe prevailing wage laws are necessary rather than simply market wages?  Do you believe that all workers should receive similar treatment, or is there something special about government contractors?"
"No. Government workers are worker, nothing more or less."
Then why are prevailing wage laws necessary rather than allowing the market to determine wages?
Somehow we talked past each other. Prevailing wage laws are not necessary.
That makes more sense for a libertarian.
"I was going by this website.  <a href=""https://www.larrysharpe.com/policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.larrysharpe.com/policy/</a>"
See the section on unions: prevailing wages.  Perhaps you need to update the site.
This doesn't mean I would propose ending them right away.  There are thousands of terrible/unnecessary  laws/regulations and many people have their livelihoods directly tied to them. Trying t end them all would just ensure nothing gets done.  Repairing a system to where they can go way with minimum damage is a better answer.
What would you propose the United States do to help control the debt &amp; the deficit?
"First step - NO BUDGET INCREASE. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVEN IF WE GO TO WAR. NO EXCEPTIONS. If we need more money, we need t stop spending someplace else. Then let's move from there."
What are your thoughts on the embarassment that was the 2016 libertarian convention?
How does the party recover from that and why should people expect the party members would run the country better than their party
We keep marching and make things better.

stopping the population exodus from NY
"In classical theory, workers migrate to where they earn the most from their labor, after subtracting local cost of commodities, local cost of land, and local taxes. In geolibertarian theory, taxes which will apply to workers in locations with lowest cost of land come out of wages for everyone, because these taxes cannot be avoid by moving to a cheaper location, and will drive workers out of the state."
"Such taxes which apply to everyone regardless of location include sales tax and personal property tax. However a tax on the price of land which increases in high-demand locations and decreases in low-demand location will not come out of wages, it only comes out of surplus payments which would otherwise be paid to private parties for the cost of land such as mortgage lenders. Shifting taxes to land thus allow workers to save more of their wages, and encourage them to move back."
"<a href=""https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89097112049&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=9"" rel=""nofollow"">This was empirically confirmed by New Zealand</a> emigration + immigration statistics, in late 1800s population was leaving the country before they introduced a land value tax, and increasing after they introduced a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">land value tax</a>."

"On one hand yes. On the other hand, how ok I am with an intrusive rule tends to be a sliding scale that gets worse the further away from me the decision is made and the less ability I have to affect a change in the system that implements that rule or makes that decision."
"Imagine you get the brilliant idea of buying a project car and keeping it on the lawn. You telling yourself no because on second thought that would be a bad idea is perfectly acceptable.  A spouse vetoing it is still acceptable, though maybe a little less so. The acceptability tends to decrease as you move outwards, from other family members who live with you-&gt;neighbors-&gt;HOA-&gt;local city ordnance-&gt;state-&gt;federal."
"And while I still personally dislike HOAs on principle, shitty HOAs don't happen in a vacuum. If you don't like it, you've probably got neighbors who also don't like it. Team up with a few of them to run for board positions, knock on some doors, and clean house next election. It's a lot easier to do than running for a local/state/federal position."
I was going to put this much more simply. Small and local = more leniency. Big and federal = fuck right off.
"Yeah, more leniency, easier to make exceptions, more tailored to specific circumstances, easier to change, easier to leave or otherwise avoid, less teeth to enforce stuff."
"That said, I've seen a few horror stories where HOAs foreclosed peoples houses out from under them over retarded technicalities with little warning."
Yeah I didnt say good. I said not as focused on dismantling power
"Also, it should be noted again that anyone who’s against all government is an anarchist, not a libertarian."
All Anarchists are libertarian not all libertarians are anarchists
"There are tons of shitty HOAs, but I can personally attest to there being one is that actually pretty nice. We don't have to mow our own lawns unless we've fenced them in, because they'll move them as they mow the public spaces. There are dog poop bag stations that are reliably restocked/emptied. They'll even send people around with snow blowers and shovels when it snows."
how much do you pay for that? I am pretty sure you could have paid some landscaping company WAY less.
"Don't worry, none of us are real libertarians anyway."
EXACTLY!
HOAs are libertarian. It's a private agreement. The freedom to associate.
Just like private communes are libertarian.
"Sort of.  The problem is that in some areas they are the only choice.

Start your own development with blackjack and hookers.
"It's a voluntary arrangement, so there's nothing inherently anti-Libertarian about HOAs, but they are NEVER worth the hassle"
I don't see how HOAs aren't libertarian. You should know what you're getting into when you join one. 
"Now, I do have problems with my HOA. There is one woman on the association who has nothing better to do than police the building. But whatever."
I don't see how HOAs aren't libertarian. You should know what you're getting into when you join one.
If you are born to a HOA member and inherit that home then your choices are to leave your home or be a member
A HOA is just a small government.
Yeah but that's a very specific scenario. Someone made the choice to join the HOA by buying that home. You don't choose the country you're born into.
"For a large percentage of the US population, one or more of their ancestors chose to move into the USA. That doesn't make it okay for the government to set any law they choose."
"Ultimately the limiter on the power of HOAs within their sphere of influence is the fact that a higher power exists that says what sorts of regulations they can have, and can restrict them if they get too large."
As I like to say: the primary purpose of a libertarian government is to stop anyone becoming an authoritarian government.
Yeah but we're kinda off topic here lol
It should be opt-in.
It is. You opt in when you choose to buy in that neighborhood
I mean it is. Don't buy a home that is part of a HOA.
"Well, it is a voluntary contract.  "
"Honestly, HOAs are pretty much the ideal government. They have the easiest immigration/emigration process of any government, and nobody is born under them. And you have the option of living under none as well, if you want."
You don't deserve to have been downvoted just for stating a different opinion.
I'm...sort of surprised I got downvoted so heavily for this seeing as how most of the replies to me are positive.
based and homepilled
I fucking hate my HOA. Rural farming town yet they won’t let us own chickens in our back yards. It’s retarded.
Join the board and steer the ship back on course. It can be done.
"I would, but I’ll let my parents deal with that. I’m dipping to college haha"
Mine doesn't like outdoor trash cans to be kept outdoors.  Then they wonder why no one uses trash cans on collection days.  This leads to trash being flown everywhere in the neighborhood since everyone now has trash in their yard.
Dear god that’s rough. Ours just gives us a ticket if we leave ours on the street a day past when it’s picked up. But on holidays the whole schedule gets shifted a day with no warning. Some holidays are holidays and some aren’t apparently.
Why'd you join?
"I didnt, my parents did"
About to run for the board for this very reason. I’m sure there’s a follow up quote about being stupid enough to attempt to govern your own HOA though.
Edit: a word
Get some other neighbors who feel the same way to run with you. I have a friend who did that and then promptly began stonewalling enforcement of the more draconian and nitpicky regulations. Eventually their Karen got frustrated and either gave up and/or moved.
Good call. Right now it’s only me. If we had 4 we’d have a majority.
I was on the board for mine.  Dealing with complaints from homeowners sucked but other than that there really is no downside.
"HOA's are voluntary organizations. On paper, they're completely compliant with property rights and the NAP."
"Plato believed in rule by a few select ascetic “philosopher kings” who owned no personal possessions and only function virtuously and making logical decisions for the people.  An interesting concept, but far shot from Libertarianism.  He also believed democracy was a terrible kind of government, because democracy always inevitably leads to dictatorship according to him."
Even the framers of the Constitution knew a direct democracy would lead to tyranny of the majority.
"Step 1: Direct Democracy.<br/>
Step 2: Mob rule.<br/>
Step 3: Demagoguery.<br/>
Step 4: Dictatorship."
Step 5: Boogaloo
I think you have steps 2and 3 in reverse order.
"not so much the wrong order, but rather they are the same thing"
As an argrntinian... fuck we're going there again aren't we?
As opposed to what?  A slave state that would collapse into civil war?
A constitutional democracy that protects certain librties regardless of how many of its stupid subjects want to vote away their freedom.
Edit: typo
Sounds like that’s edging a bit into technocracy
[deleted]
Somebody has to define the rights that can’t be encroached.
[deleted]
"A technocracy is just ""rule by experts"" which is what every unaccountable bureacracy claims anyways.  "
No different than a dictatorship or monarchy or degenerated democracy. 
"""the government or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts.""failure in the war on poverty discredited technocracy"""
The framers of the constitution didn’t want poor people to vote.
"No one should be able to vote, least of all those who'd use the state to gain welfare, subsidies, regulations, laws, war and all other kinds of tyranny."
are you saying the recipients of welfare shouldnt vote or just those who are abusing it?
Being able to vote and one group offering welfare is bribery.
Fair. What about offering a tax cuts?
Only if you consider an offer to steal less of your money somehow a bribe. Sounds more like extortion
What if the tax cut only applies to certain people? As in I will steal less of your money than the proportionate amount of someone else.
"See you’re thinking of taxes as a given, libertarian thought tends to see taxes as theft at any level and to any degree.  Think of that what you will unless you establish that your hypothetical justifies the existence of taxation in some way it’s going to be a nonstarter for a lot of folks."
"ah so the only people who should be allowed to vote should be rich people, there can't possibly be any tyranny from that"
"Yes, one must be rich to not be on welfare"
Poor people are also the least educated so their votes are the shittiest.
"Nah white people usually vote the ""shittiest"""
"Okay, so throw away every political structure and observation they ever constructed because the most enlightened government ever created up to that time didn't quite meet the social standards of modern people in 2020 - no, I don't think that's right."
"No, just use a lens of full context when looking at their views. Appreciate the ways they were the best of their time, while critiquing the ways they fell short. Don’t fall into black/white thinking."
Does the full lens negate the accuracy of their beliefs on this issue? I dont really see how it does
The framers of the constitution didn’t want <del>poor</del> people with no stake in the continued success of the country to vote.
"The philosophy followed after the ""no taxation without representation"" philosophy. 
 Landowners were taxed.  No one else was.  It was easy to become a landowner were one so inclined.  In the early days of the country you just had to find some empty space, put down property markers, and claim the space as your own.  In New England that generally meant surrounding the property with a stone wall at least three feet in height. If you drive around New England today you will see drystone remnants of those fences in a lot places."
"Every time some ambitious politician has wanted to institute policies that weren't popular with voters, they've made moves to replace or dilute those voters with those they believed would support their policies.  That's probably why it should come as no surprise that the government became larger and the country less free the more the electorate was expanded."
Those remnants are left over from farming. There are a lot of stones in New England soil and so farmers would have to dig them up to plant crops.  The logical thing to do with them was build a wall.
"And we all know tyranny of the minority is superior to tyranny of the majority, because..."
"We don't have ""tyranny of the minority"". No one minority has control over the entire electorate. If you're trying to argue that our electoral system is advantageous to voters in smaller states, fine, but that's the point. "
"Our republic is based around votes from the several states. The fact that voters in Wyoming are ""worth more"" is intentional, because it puts the state of Wyoming on equal footing with the others. <em>That's the idea</em>."
"It's not though. Under the original language in the constitution the number of representatives would grow, which would reduce the number of voters per representative (and thereby reduce the relative extra value a smaller state would have). Smaller states would still have some additional representation per person, but becuase of their senators, not because of their congressional district(s)."
Capping the number of representatives has thrown the balance of power out of whack significantly.
"Wasnt the total number of representatives capped, not reps per state, so that it is still proportional (keeping in mind that each state is guaranteed at least 1)"
capping the total number of representatives effectively caps the reps per state. There have to be a minimum of 50 representatives for the 50 different states... so that 235-49 is the effective cap. The problem is can 235 properly proportion the population of the united states and the answer is hell no.
"The cap is 435, so minus 50 is 385. There are 385 reps to be proportioned by population in addition to the 1 per state already given out. It seems very close to proportional while maintaining a managable number of people to congregate at the House and have time to speak. This seems very fair and wise to me"
So it's fair a voter in Vermont is worth 3x more than a vote in Texas?
"So it takes 2 seconds to do the math. Texas has 797,222 people per vote in the House. Vermont has 626,299 people per vote in the House. This is astonishingly fair. Don't be dishonest, or don't believe everything you hear, find out for yourself"
I thought the idea was checks and balances. Equal senate representation to make up for a smaller house representation and a smaller stake in the presidential election. Why does a voter in Wyoming have more power than a Floridian in the presidential election?
Equal Senate representation balances population-dependent house representation. Making the electorate population-dependent would shift the balance back towards more populous states. 
"You're making the mistake of thinking in terms of the individual voters as if this is a flawed direct democracy. Why does a voter in Wyoming have more power? So that the state of Wyoming has a proportional (not equal, but fair) say in the election of the highest position in the Union. You might ask, ""why does that matter?"" The answer is that the system is designed to represent many semi-autonomous member states in a union in a fair and proportional way that doesn't disadvantage smaller ones, handing the keys to the handful of highly populous states."
Ok well stated. But I would argue that the president was meant to simply be an arbitrator and have no real power when everything was being drawn up. That would mean to me that the president should be utilitarian in nature and work for the greatest possible good for the greatest number of people (populous states have the greatest number of people). The President was built to be over ruled by the other two houses
"I agree that the president has become too politically prominent since the framing of the Constitution, but I disagree with the utilitarian stance. "
"People don't necessarily know, or vote for, what would be objectively ""best"" for them. There's no way to really quantify how much ""good"" anyone is really doing - the seen and the unseen, et cetera. I think the president should be chosen by the system that most fairly represents the interest of all the states proportionately."
"""worth more""  is the same as equal footing now? If its for a presidential election it should be 1 citizen = 1 vote, not this current setup where some citizens are more equal than others. We already have the senate to give states the opportunity to vote and debate on an equal footing."
"Land shouldn't have rights, only people"
"This is gonna be a crazy thought for you, but how about.... no tyranny at all?"
What would your life be like without a president?
Anarchy would create a shithole pretty quick.
What part of life would you have trouble with if you weren't being ruled over?
Mostly other people doing whatever the hell they want to me.
Not enough local government means we would be susceptible to gangs. Not enough national government means we would be screwed in the event of a war. 
"Sure, we could theoretically form large numbers of militia due to the free access to firearms, but it would fail against a sufficiently organized antagonistic force."
"Of course, we can't hand everything off to the government either, because then we're slaves to them, which is arguably worse."
It's all about giving the government enough power to protect us while holding enough back to be able to overthrow it if necessary. Where that balance is is the debate of the ages.
Not enough local government means we would be susceptible to gangs.
Anarchy != chaos. Form a defensive or security force. Hire an organization. Hire a police force. Whatever you want. The point is it's consensual. If your police force is being corrupt or racist you can fire them.
Not enough national government means we would be screwed in the event of a war.
"Ah yes, all those wars that happen between private parties... Wait... how many US wars have been the result of actions from the US government...?"
but it would fail against a sufficiently organized antagonistic force.
Source? Cave dwellers in Afghanistan are doing just fine vs the most powerful military in the world.
It's all about giving the government enough power to protect us while holding enough back to be able to overpower if necessary.
"Why wouldn't you rather have a consensual relationship with your guardians? If they're being corrupt, fire them. Right now you can't do that. Don't pay your taxes and you will be locked in a cage."
I am on board with most of this except for your private protection force premise. 
Let's say you hire a police force that you try to fire because they are corrupt. Do you think they would just accept being fired and walk away with their palms up?
Mostly other people doing whatever the hell they want to me.  
Not enough local government means we would be susceptible to gangs.
"I think private security can adequately handle these situations in <em>most</em> cases. Communities can hire security to patrol and police their own neighborhoods (e.g. maybe something funded by an HOA?). Corporations can hire security for asset protection, as they already do. "
"I emphasize <em>most</em> because even with govt police forces, we're still susceptible to gangs. We'll probably never completely stop them, so there are limits no matter what. "
Not enough national government means we would be screwed in the event of a war. 
"I don't see a big issue here. Totally within the framework of the constitution, with respect to national defense (not offense). It was a limited power of the federal govt, but we should keep in mind those limited powers did not extend to a military-industrial complex, CIA, FBI, imperialism, and so on..."
It's all about giving the government enough power to protect us while holding enough back to be able to overthrow it if necessary. Where that balance is is the debate of the ages. 
"Fair point. I personally think we should stick with the limited powers in the constitution granted to the federal govt by the states, a Minarchy essentially. "
"Not to say I don't think Ancaps have good points to make, I'll personally just chose to die on the Minarchy hill before the Ancap hill, so-to-speak."
turf wars
...you think the president is what's keeping thugs from stealing your house?
This isn't my point of view but I think the idea is that the system that includes the president is what keeps thugs from stealing my house
"Sure. I'm trying to make the point to the other guy that you don't need a president, or even a federal government to implement a system of property defense."
"Yes actually, I think stable government and police do prevent society from falling into turf wars and different factions vying for power."
"Anarchy in the context of libertarianism simply means an absence of rulers or political authority. It doesn't mean hierarchy, laws, and order wouldn't still exist. We'd still have our homes, cars and iPhones with or without the state."
...because...
The minority has more to fear from the majority than the majority has to fear from the minority.
Still no reason for why the minority’s interests should be valued more than the majority.
Tyranny of the minority is so much better!
That is a false dichotomy
"Perhaps but in practice that's both the intent and outcome of the Constitution with concrete examples being the disproportionate representation in the electoral college, Senate, and even in how the House resolves rounding errors during apportionment."
"Not at all. The intent of the constitution was to restrict the government from being able to tyrannize the populace at all, regardless of whether the majority or the minority was in control. "
"As long as the constitution is upheld, there would be limited amount of damage that any tyrannical majority or minority could do. Unfortunately, the fact is that the government largely ignores parts of the constitution (2nd amendment is decaying, patriot act was a nail in the coffin of the 4th amendment, 9th amendment is ignored when states ban same sex marriage, and 10th amendments has been ruled to mean the literal OPPOSITE of what the text says (essentially giving the government infinite power)... etc"
I agree that the norms and institutions meant to temper the political majority have eroded.
define direct democracy.
"As opposed to a representative system: all citizens cast a vote, votes are counted, majority rules."
They weren't opposed to that on the grounds of tyranny. It was actually proposed multiple times... They didn't see it as feasible for logistical reasons. The founding fathers aren't a monolith.
"That's why I said the framers of the Constitution, rather than the founding fathers. There were still many hot internal disagreements between the framers, of course, but I'm speaking of the opinion that determined the actual content of the document."
He was right about democracy. It’s glorified mob rule.
"He also believed democracy was a terrible kind of government, because democracy always inevitably leads to dictatorship according to him."
"Because it's true. NAP violations withholding, why should another man vote on laws for a man that doesn't wish to be ruled over?"
NAP violations withholding
One hell of a caveat.  Why is anyone obligated to abide by the NAP above any other moral code?
"You're not obligated to do anything. Just know that if you start killing people, your neighbors probably aren't going to put up with it for very long."
"Everyone already (mostly) abides by the NAP anyway, or at least believes in it. Any laws that go beyond the NAP are unnecessary, and a violation of your fellow man's freedom."
"Just know that if you start killing people, your neighbors probably aren't going to put up with it for very long."
Sounds like something a Tankie would say
Explain
"I'm always hearing about how the Revolution is around the corner, and the violence of the capitalist state will come to an end."
"But my neighbors continue to have a shocking tolerance for police brutality, civil asset forfeiture, and tax-theft."
"I'm always hearing about how the Revolution is around the corner, and the violence of the capitalist state will come to an end."
That's funny. I never hear this from people I talk to. I only see this in random comments on the internet.
Retaliation.
NAP is a preemptive truce.
Retaliation.
These violent delights have violent ends
"But that just leaves us with ""Might Makes Right"".  Not the NAP."
NAP is less of a moral code and more of a framework for disputes and aggression.
Predicated on a very particular understanding of aggression.
Recently I've been feeling like he might have a point...
"He also believed democracy was a terrible kind of government, because democracy always inevitably leads to dictatorship according to him."
"On a long enough timeline... etc, etc."
"Of course, in the modern era you could also spin that as ""Dictatorship always inevitably leads to Democracy""."
"To be fair, a democracy was directly responsible for the death of his mentor, Socrates (granted, Socrates chose to submit to the will of the state even though he thought it was wrong)"
I agree with Churchill: It's the worst form of government except for all the others.
He’s not wrong on democracy. 
"The ideal of “select ascetic philosopher kings” is the same fundamental flaw behind calls for democratic socialism, or whatever they are calling communism these days."
"Yep, even Plato was aware of the flaws in his philosopher kings idea.  If any of the kings becomes corrupt or embraces the ego at all, it causes his government to collapse and spiral into worse and worse kinds of government, eventually all the way to dictatorship.  So it’s an interesting concept but it would just never work because people naturally fall into a greedy/egotistical state, as much as they may be trained and try not to, that’s what happens.  Even Plato was aware of that fault, he was just playing with ideas.  You could argue Plato predicted socialism would never work before socialism ever existed."
"All of those other, valid, points are irrelevant. Do you have any rebuttal to the point raised by the quote?"
"Plato believed in technocracy which in function is no different than dictatorship since the head of state does not have time to manage everything or much at all leaving it to the various government bureaucrats. Same as Monarchy or Democracy as it degenerates into plutocracy as it is the result of centralized power, whatever the label."
Plato was the daddy of authoritarianism.
Though he did recognize that a mechanized workforce may free us from the need for an authoritarian state...
I read this quote a while ago and it's really starting to stick with me. I'm tired of listening to the morons running this country but all I do is complain. Maybe it's time I step up.
!remindme 500 years
Is that really Plato?
"It's from <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/150/pg150.txt"">The Republic</a>.  I believe it's quoting Socrates.  "
"[Rulers] must be paid in one of three modes of payment:
money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.<br/>
...<br/>
And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves.  And not being
ambitious they do not care about honour.  Wherefore necessity must be
laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of
punishment.  And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
dishonourable.  Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself."
Tks for posting.
"""The forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable"" - How does this describe Democracy in that case, I wonder?"
It doesn't apply only to democracy.  It's about seeking office vs being pressured into it.  
"In a democracy it is useful and ubiquitous to at least pay lip service to the idea that you are running, not because you are a self-aggrandizing ego-maniac, but rather because you are compelled by circumstances or the poor job the incumbent has to done to sacrifice yourself for the good of the people, hah."
"No, it's from Republic, so it was actually Socrates. Plato ""wrote"" the books but they were conversations from Socrates."
Have you been reading The Republic?
"Just vote harder, everybody."
You must not be very familiar with Plato's work if you believe he was an advocate for libertarian ideals.
When did he ever say Plato was an advocate for libertarian ideals? lol it’s just an interesting quote that could spark discussion. Especially in a group of people who tend to think that the people running our country are inferior.
I don’t think that group agrees on who is superior
"No of course not, but no one really does. And it's part of libertarian ideals to reduce the power of those in charge, so that no one is really 'ruling'."
People you disagree with can still have good ideas...
You’re <em>that guy</em> at parties huh?
"Apply that to US foreign policy involvement. Is complete retreat and the inevitably following global nuclear arms race, explosion of warfare and imperial expansion of China really the optimal situation or is there something to be said for the Pax Americana? Libertarians don't even consider that instead they adopt the ideologically convenient leftist view of how no conflict could ever occur if it weren't for the big Satan in Washington. I used to believe that to some extent but now it just seems embarrassingly vacuous."
"Boogeyman: explosion of warfare - imperial China
Straw Man: leftist view - big Satan"
It's like a lesson on how to apply bias in an argument.
"Besides this being one of the biggest slippery slope fallacies I have ever seen, you are trying to group millions of individuals into one category. One that I don’t even fit in myself as a libertarian."
"I'm talking about the libertarian mainstream which is non-interventionist. Sure, there are exceptions but I don't think that you would dispute that in general. Obviously describing the results of abolishing the world order as we know it as a 'slippery slope fallacy' is nonsensical. This would be an enormous event with consequences that are well understood around the world. If no one is going to stop them it's not like Egypt isn't going to develop nukes for example. Neither will the countries of  Saudi Arabia or Qatar continue to exist, these tiny but resource rich entities are complete inventions and would immediately be gobbled up just like that happened throughout human history."
"Careful, if nobody stops them, they'll be equal to us! And we run this bitch, damnit."
"You’re right, radical Islamists <em>should</em> have nuclear weapons!"
More pointing out the hypocrisy. No one should.
"Whether or not they should, they do."
No shit? And who is the only country that has ever used the worst weapons ever?
Are you referencing Japan? It's pretty well agreed upon that nuclear bombs were the best way to end the war with Japan with the fewest casualties.
If radical Christians get to have them
"Radical Islam is inherently violent and authoritarian. You could make the case that Christianity is authoritarian (though I’d disagree), but it certainly isn’t violent. "
What “radical Christians” have nuclear weapons? There isn’t even such a thing as a radical Christian nation on the planet.
"What we in our culture call “radical Islam” is actually the hyper conservative militant version. Which is to say that the Christian equivalent isn’t <a href=""/r/radicalchristianity"" rel=""nofollow"">r/radicalchristianity</a> but instead hyper conservative militant Christianity."
"The best extreme example would be someone like <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Shea"" rel=""nofollow"">Matt Shea</a>, but Mike Pence is also in the camp but not as far down the scale. There is a significant number of fundamentalist Christians in America who are just as dangerous with nukes, and they have a lot of representatives in office. It is not <em>currently</em> as directly violent, but that’s likely due to the fact that we have been the nation in supremacy, not the one besieged by one on another continent, for over half a decade."
How many Christian terror attacks have there been in the last decade?
Edit: or even the last century for that matter.
"That's very complicated to quantify. That's partly because it's hard to find specific numbers. It is also partly because whether we label something a ""Christian terrorist attack"" is highly debatable, but we definitely are slower to label ideological/political attacks by Christians as terrorism (especially in ""Christian"" nations) than we are to label ideological/political attacks by Muslims as terrorism."
"A great example of this is found in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_serial_bombings"" rel=""nofollow"">Mark Anthony Conditt</a>, who terrorized Austin for weeks in 2018 with his bombings, was a religious Christian active in a Christian survivalist group, and died via suicide bomb when police tried to arrest him. Authorities refused to call him a terrorist because they didn't have evidence of him <em>explicitly</em> trying to <em>terrorize</em> people or saying he did it out of his faith, but if a Muslim (or secular Arab) were to do the same we would definitely call it terrorism."

TL;DR: more than you'd think for a faith that supposedly follows a messiah who told his followers to be nonviolent.
That's one of the aspects of Plato's argument. In your ideal world should ISIS have the same nuclear capability as the United States?
"If stopping Islamists from having nuclear weapons was a priority of US, then America should have invaded Pakistan instead of Iraq. Let's also not forget that Iran wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent to prevent an American attack; they're largely defense in nature. Think of them as similar to North Korea in this way. To guarantee that a hot war is prevented, mutually assured destruction is a great tool."
Absolutely not. No one would.
Now there are gradations between ISIS and whatever the perfect good is. The question is at what point can we allow influence and at what point do we curb it. No one cares that for example Britain has nukes or that Japan or Switzerland could build them in a few months. These are not hostile entities. That's not true for North Korea or Iran. The US and its partners see it as their responsibility to not let these types of regimes become too powerful and that's what today is called imperialism. Countries which seek cooperation within a competitive but peaceful framework do not become targets. That's the Pax Americana. 
"It's unfair that Americans have to pay for it but in general it's a good thing. Certainly better than any previous arrangement in human history, which ought to be the most important consideration when thinking about this. Leftists hate this American paradigm because it falcilitates the maintenance and growth of a global capitalist economy. Their ideology demands its total rejection which usually takes the form of grotesque slander."
"Non-inventionism is not a leftist ideal, it is fundamentally libertarian to challenge the authority of the state in all affairs, including forign policy. This is especially true considering that congress hasn't needed to provide a declaration of war to justify US entry into conflicts across the middle East since the war on terror was authorized in 2001. "
"Consent of the governed is a libertarian ideal that our founders considered crucial. If the public doesn't approve of these wars in the Middle East, then there is no reason to further escalate these easily avoidable conflicts."
There's a difference between protecting oneself from aggression as seen in WWII and creating undemocratic regime changes ie Pinochet or the Shah for the reasons of market access and resource extraction.
In WWII we assisted a horrible genocidal regime as part of a collective defense against Germany.
"Afterward we assisted many bad, but not quite as horrible, regimes as part of a collective defense against the Soviet Union."
How exactly was our support of Pinochet or the Shah part of collective defense? Did such collective defense work toward the defense of the citizens of Chile and Iran?
"We have genocided, Britain was actively genociding, the Soviet Union was... grainiciding it's own. The countries themselves aren't the problem, the existence of countries is the problem"
Pinochet and Sandanistas weren't as awful? Vietnam wasn't as awful? the US originally funded the Taliban and Al Quida - aren't they as awful?
Did any of those commit literal genocide or number their victims in the millions?
the ideologically convenient leftist view of how no conflict could ever occur if it weren't for the big Satan in Washington.
"Nobody claims this. The claim is that the state built the most massively powerful murder machine with stolen money, and wields that weapon without consent of the people."
There will always be conflict. We just shouldn't be forced to fund the wars of the rich elites. <strong>Consent is everything.</strong>
"To the extent that I’m a libertarian, my libertarianism ends at the border. "
"Libertarian government allows and <em>protects</em> the creation of organizations that make their own rules for themselves.  If you want to create a commune on your land, a libertarian government will protect your right to do that, and your commune can isolate itself.  If you want to create an isolated capitalist enclave you may do the same, and a libertarian government will protect that."
But there is no world government to protect your country’s right to isolate itself. There is no world government to enforce the non-aggression principle.
The reality is that your country’s government has to protect your country because no other earthly power will. And effective defense unfortunately requires being an active part of the community.
"Just as libertarian government will never exist without the participation of libertarians in the current government, a country that wants peace needs to work with other nations to achieve peace."
Plato didnt believe in voting rights. He was a believer of the epistocracy.
"Exactly why I recently accepted a promotion I was offered, even though I didn't particularly want to go into management."
"I mean, if I think I'm the best, I probably shouldn't rule. Ruling keeps me from doing more productive things. Why do we send our greatest talent into management?"
"Lol, prolly why all management are useless and stupid. Someone's actually gotta do the important work."
"Yeah but then when you get in power you can't keep thinking that people are ""inferior"" to you.  That's no good either."
This quote doesn’t fit an average person.
Isn't that basically the plot of <em>The Office</em> episode where Jim turns down the offer to be manager?
"Plato is advocating becoming a tyrant, apparently. And so are you."
"“The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.”  (564) Republic by Plato."
"""Tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggregated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?"" (564) Republic"
"""For harmony is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize that which disagrees."" (187c) Symposium by. Plato"
​
Plato believed very much democracy was and led to chaos.
Just remember plutos great republic failed epicly and got himself sold to slavery
“But ah dun wahn it!”
Play doh
"When he said this I think he was talking about the philosopher king. This wasn't used in the context of democracy, actually Plato hated democracy."
It's almost as if humans are social animals through genetics and maintain order through social hierarchy with rules and shit
You wouldn’t have created this thread had you read just the next sentence of Plato’s fairytale.
"Listening to Trump stumble through his repeated talking points, slurring ""accomplishments"", it stands to reason that only one conclusion can be reached: We get the government we deserve because we refuse to participate as citizens to the degree that we could."
Except for the fact that millions more people voted for his opponent than him. A small handful of people got the government they deserved.
"Half the electorate sat out the election. Your conclusion is based on the popular vote and not the electoral college. Half the people stayed home because they could not stomach Trump or Hillary. Hillary lost the Blue Wall, which would have given her the win because she ran a lazy campaign. The third party candidates also torpedoed her in several key districts."
Plato was a major league statist.
Not really. He rejected all forms of positive law that regulated everyday life for the public. Removing all laws that govern economic and social life doesnt seem statist at all.
"Having a President with no morals has degraded this country faster than I thought possible. I didn't care for many of Obama's policies, but I believed him to be a moral person. Donald is inferior to me in every category."
26171
Not hard to be superior to an angry orange senile wannabe dictator. Pretty sure my 2 year old would be a more rational leader.
Plato was a scumbag.
"Y'all are really downvoting me? Read The Republic. This guy's an enemy of liberty, even thousands of years after his death."
"Lincoln Chafee is not a libertarian, he has no place representing the Libertarian Party. His record is terrible:"
Lol he supports the anti-libertarian positions in both parties. Aka authoritarian is is label.
"And, worst of all, he supports adopting the metric system."
"Lol, huh? What's wrong with metric system? It makes too much sense?"
"“The metric system is the tool of the Devil!  My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and that’s the way I likes it!”"
When they start driving on the right side of the road we'll switch to the metric system
"Seen as that we invented the automobile, it only makes sense that they follow our rules."
"I hate to say this, but a German dude invented the first petrol automobile."
Ford invented the assembly line to mass produce his automobile.
Its unamerican
"Ahh, right."
"So is peace, but I still like peace"
We should all be supporting Jacob Hornberger. He is the most principled candidate running for the Libertarian Party nomination and has the most potential to have a libertarian moment as big as Ron Paul.
I support Adam Kokesh
Lmao they probably don't even know what libertarianism is if they call themselves libertarians.
Just another party for you to run in.
"You guys should decide and let everyone else know. You are gaining members but have no clear, WORKABLE agenda. You’ll end up with no identity at all if you don’t formulate one."
I think the anti-gun disqualifies him more than the health care thing.
"Bill of rights is the most libertarian legal document I know of and gun rights are right there, but health care is not mentioned, while the 10th does apply somewhat."
Amen
"What the hell is a ""Failed Republican/Democrat?"""
"He used to be a Republican Senator, lost his race for re-election. Failed Republican. "
He ran from President as a Democrat in 2016 and dropped out very early. Failed Democrat.
Ah. I guess that makes sense in Context.
Republican/Democrat with extra steps.
He's been largely unsuccessful running for office as a member of either of the two major parties.
Well. There goes the 'liberty' part of Libertarian.
"This sub had no problem letting commies take over, why not the party as well?"
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. This guy looks like grandpa Munster
"As a former Rhode Islander, I know this guy is a giant asshat. I do admire his graduate school choice after getting the privilege of studying at Brown."
It's okay to change your mind and become libertarian. But this isn't that at all.
You are only free when you have surrendered everything to the government.
You can be a libertarian and not want people to die because of gunshot wounds and overpriced hospital stays.
Libertarians don't support government healthcare. Period.
Which is why no one will ever vote for them.
"Then why are you on <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a>? Seriously, all you do is talk about how you disagree with libertarians. "
"For someone who disagrees with libertarians so much, isn't this the last sub you should be on?"
I thought Libertarians support individual rights? I'll post wherever I please thank you very much.
Apparently you have no idea how rights work. You have the right to post on a internet forum without the <strong>government</strong> stopping you. That same internet forum has the right to ban you. And I as an individual have the right to <em>criticize</em> and question you. 
All you do is complain about the subreddit and libertarianism. So to ask why you're here is a fair question.
"Ah so you don't want a place to discuss multiple opinions, you just want an echo chamber. Is that right? You just want to ban people who disagree with you?"
Ah so you don't want a place to discuss multiple opinions
"Not at all. <a href=""/r/AskLibertarians"">r/AskLibertarians</a> is a great subreddit. I'd encourage you to take your clever critiques of libertarianism there, as the explicit point of that subreddit is discussion with non libertarians. <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a> is a subreddit for libertarians to discuss libertarianism. You're some sort of progressive/leftist, right? You don't see libertarians going into your subreddits, derailing conversations, and contradicting the entire point of the subreddit. Yet you felt the need to troll our subreddit, and I ask again: Why?"
you just want an echo chamber
"""Everything I don't like is an echo chamber."" Somebody doesn't understand how reddit works."
That wasn't the question.
Sure you can. But you can’t take away people’s rights to do it.
"You know that you can be a libertarianism and support taxes, right? Libertarianism isn't anarchy. If you purity test like Berniebros do then you're going to alienate a ton of people that would otherwise fit in your tent."
One can understand and accept the necessity of taxation without directly supporting taxation. Taxation should be minimized to the least necessary and collected in the least economically disruptive manner.
"So if you can understand and accept the necessity of taxation it stands to reason that everyone will have their own opinion of what national necessities are, even libertarians. You said you can't take away people's rights to implement healthcare, but you seem to accept the necessity of taking away rights for other things."
ALL taxation should be voluntary. If it is something necessary people would pay for it anyways.
I don't want people to die for a lot of preventable reasons like drowning for instance. I'm going to propose banning pools and access to bodies of water like lakes and oceans and still claim to be a Libertarian using your stellar logic.
No the party must be pure. Nevermind an ex Republican gave the LP the biggest boost in votes. Twice.
"Interesting, so to be a True Libertarian, one must give up their freedom of choice and individual judgment on all issues."
"This sub seems to think so, but that isnt too meaningful. Note the snark in my last comment."
"Ah, so the Libertarian Party should be the Republican Lite party? I thought this subreddit thought libertarians were too similar to Republicans..."
"No, but purity testing the shit out of candidates is a stupid idea."
"If any recent LP presidential candidate deserves to be called out for not being a libertarian, it's Lincoln Chafee. Voting for the Afghanistan War, the Patriot Act, more surveillance, more gun control, more taxes, and more spending should be disqualifying."
I think voting for the Patriot Act's reauthorization alone should be a sure sign someone isn't a libertarian.
"Agreed. Not only did Chafee vote to reauthorize the Patriot Act multiple times, he voted for the Patriot Act when it was originally voted on."
"Exactly, sure there are some candidates that may not fully follow all of the libertarian party platform, but there's a difference between being mostly libertarian or libertarian with a few exceptions and a non-libertarian that manages to agree with libertarians on a few points. Mqny democratic-socialists are opposed to the war on drugs, which libertarians agree on, yet democratic-socialists are by no stretch of the imagination libertarian."
So libertarians shouldn't make any effort to keep non-libertarian ideas out of our political circles?
We should just accept everything and say it's all libertarian?
Is that seriously what you're suggesting?
Yeah but people here are like 70% just 20 year olds who don't know anything about the world other than not wanting to pay for healthcare taxes while they're healthy.
It's been pretty solidly shown that in modern society access to healthcare should not be limited based off a person's income or current employment status.
Two policies that have been proven to be effective.
"Wow, a ""not a libertarian"" post about someone who isn't orange.  The originality almost put me in a state of shock."
"An anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti porn, neo-confederate, theocrat... isnt a libertarian either, but then there's Ron Paul."
The anti-gay candidate endorsed by Log Cabin Republicans. A gay rights group. I’m not wasting time looking into you other claims.
Source for those claims?
"Yeah Ron Paul fucking sucks but he is one of the few willing to commit political suicide by flying the Libertarian flag so people here will still vote for him. If you guys actually want to change the politics of the US vote for real candidates that might win, and focus on ranked choice voting and other solutions that can pull the sway of voters away from the two party system."
Yeah Ron Paul fucking sucks but he is one of the few willing to commit political suicide by flying the Libertarian flag so people here will still vote for him.
Vote for him for what? He's 84 and hasn't been in political office in 7 years.
"For reference, Carl Sagan addresses this directly in his little paper on abortion, it's a great read which I think frames the debate well - "
"<a href=""http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml"">http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml</a>"
Relevant excerpt from page 4- 
"So, if only a person can be murdered, when does the fetus attain personhood? When its face becomes distinctly human, near the end of the first trimester? When the fetus becomes responsive to stimuli--again, at the end of the first trimester? When it becomes active enough to be felt as quickening, typically in the middle of the second trimester? When the lungs have reached a stage of development sufficient that the fetus might, just conceivably, be able to breathe on its own in the outside air?"
The trouble with these particular developmental milestones is not just that they're arbitrary. More troubling is the fact that none of them involves uniquely human characteristics--apart from the superficial matter of facial appearance. All animals respond to stimuli and move of their own volition. Large numbers are able to breathe. But that doesn't stop us from slaughtering them by the billions. Reflexes and motion are not what make us human.
"Other animals have advantages over us--in speed, strength, endurance, climbing or burrowing skills, camouflage, sight or smell or hearing, mastery of the air or water. Our one great advantage, the secret of our success, is thought--characteristically human thought. We are able to think things through, imagine events yet to occur, figure things out. That's how we invented agriculture and civilization. Thought is our blessing and our curse, and it makes us who we are."
"Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted ""gray matter"" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month."
"By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think."
"Acquiescing in the killing of any living creature, especially one that might later become a baby, is troublesome and painful. But we've rejected the extremes of ""always"" and ""never,"" and this puts us--like it or not--on the slippery slope. If we are forced to choose a developmental criterion, then this is where we draw the line: when the beginning of characteristically human thinking becomes barely possible."
"It is, in fact, a very conservative definition: Regular brain waves are rarely found in fetuses. More research would help… If we wanted to make the criterion still more stringent, to allow for occasional precocious fetal brain development, we might draw the line at six months. This, it so happens, is where the Supreme Court drew it in 1973--although for completely different reasons."
"I thought about this before. “When is it murder?”  I love this explanation. It’s easy, concise and able to be monitored.   I am pro choice but only bc I don’t believe the government should dictate what a person can or cannot do with their bodies. Morally I do disagree with it."
That argument falls flat when you consider the average dog has the intelligence of a two year old. It’s completely arbitrary
He literally says they’re arbitrary in the second paragraph?
That was in reference to characteristics other then intelligence.
God dammit I love Carl Sagan.
Many mentally disabled people are likely less intelligent than certain animals. Is it all right to kill them?
But can't survive without the mother and thus acting like a parasite and the mother as a host.
​
"It can be accurate that a fetus will always want to live but like any 2 parties involvement, there has to be consent by the mother (and having sex is not the consent of getting pregnant) for both parties partake in a 9 month, hormone, body changing, life-changing, experience."
"If the mother doesn't agree it is not right of anybody else, government, religious believers to FORCE someone to have a baby but hers."
If then people have an issue with a fetus dying then it is up to them in a free market to discover and roll out a process that allows any fetus to be removed from the mother and grow for 9 months in said process.
If a discovery is made then it should be the people and religious organization to run it like a non-profit business (since you can't start sending a bill after that person turns 18.
Or if the people want can have the government do it ( I am opposed to this cause the government should not use funds from people who don't believe in this cutting edge process to pay for a fetus to become babies.)
"At that point, you just have test-tube babies like how people trying to clone."
"This is why I'm pro-choice, its a 2 party transaction and both parties have to choose to go through this."
​
**edit**
There could be a medical process that allows the fetus at whatever term transfer from a nonconsenting mother to a woman who will consent. But again the science needs to be discovered.
How is having sex not consenting to the consequences? It's exactly the same as if I am driving a car I accept the responsibility if I accidentally hit someone. 
"The child, on the other hand, has absolutely no say in its own creation. If any party is being forced upon against their will it is them."
But can't survive without the mother and thus acting like a parasite and the mother as a host.
A baby up to toddler can't survive without a person providing it with free stuff. So that's not a strong argument.
"I'm someone that believes in a spirit/soul, so I personally say conception. I think it is an extremely difficult topic to come to legal conclusions on. I am glad with the way you framed the question though. IMO, all discussions of abortion should be framed around the question 'when does life begin?'  Because really, that is the primary issue at play here. If the baby is alive, abortion is murder. If the baby is NOT alive, then abortion is fine."
"I'm OK with one having beliefs, but I also demand that my government be 100% secular in the separation of church from state.  A such, a hypothetical ""soul"" for which we have no objective evidence, should have no place in lawmaking."
"Also, by the strictest definition of life, every cell in our bodies is alive, and with modern technology can be made to survive to adulthood (i.e. cloning)."
"I think the debate on abortion can be separate from a church standpoint. As said above, it’s about when life begins. Before that point it’s ok, after that point it’s not. The problem come from defining when that point is."
"IMO, all discussions of abortion should be framed around the question 'when does life begin?'"
"I completely disagree. This question is fundamentally flawed and unanswerable. More importantly, the act of trying to answer it is a politically statement in and of itself. People are only able to come up with a personal definition of what life means and therefore when it would begin, not a universal or logical one. Therefore, no abortion legislation can be justified."
Everybody has a unique and contradictory definition of what it means to be alive and what the moral value of a fetus is. Each is as valid as the next. No one has any right to declare their personal definition universal and use the government as a tool to enforce it upon others.
I'm going to throw in as someone who's had one baby and is currently working on another.  
"Until science can 100% say when a fetus is a person, we will never know,  it's between you and your God or conscience.  "
"I don't see illegalizing abortion as a safe option.  When politicians get involved,  everything turns to crap.  (A) What if the baby is brain dead or horribly deformed,  I cannot ask someone to carry that child to term (although personally I would for possible organ donation). (B) What if doctors (lazy or malicious) use this an excuse not to perform a needed abortion (mother dying, child brain dead,  etc)"
"So,  therefore,  I don't know and I cannot in good conscience make that decision for anyone else.  It sucks,  but life isn't fair."
A. Literally nobody wants to force mothers to give birth to children with fatal defects. Adding a medical exception to any abortion law is a pretty simple matter.
B. Are you suggesting doctors should be forced to perform abortions against their will? Seems like an odd stance for someone who is pro-choice.
A. I've spoken to a woman who had issues with a catholic hospital. Making it a law magically makes everyone follow it? 
B. I never said that.  You can shop around.
"Personally for me it is when the cells begin to replicate which is almost immediately after conception. This is because at this point it fulfills the necessary requirements to be considered a living thing (biologically speaking) and as it is made up of human DNA, it is thus a human. Put them together and it becomes a human life. At this point NAP applies (in my opinion) because the living thing inside you is not causing any direct, life threatening, harm or damage to property and so it shouldn’t be purposefully harmed."
Thank you for sharing
Edit to add:
"I'm curious what your position on Henrietta Lacks cells would be. Do they also deserve protection from the NAP?
Seems a bit over the top, I know. But by your earlier definition, they would be afforded human rights as well"
"I'm curious what your position on Henrietta Lacks cells would be. Do they also deserve protection from the NAP? Seems a bit over the top, I know. But by your earlier definition, they would be afforded human rights as well"
"Henrietta Lack's cells are not zygotes, they were harvested from her cancerous cervix. They aren't the type of cell that spontaneously develops into a human being"
"No cells spontaneously develop into a fetus without the assistance of a mother; alternatively, <strong>any</strong> cell can be allowed to develop into a fetus using modern cloning."
"op's position was that a zygote IS a human being, not that it develops into one."
What constitutes a “human being” then? Obviously those cells have a human genome and are capable of self replicating. So when does the zygote become sufficiently developed as to classify it differently from a collection of similarly self-replicating cells?
"Or, why should ""human being"" be a standard at all? I've long advocated that person, not human, be the standard. A person required some level of social and interpersonal communication. Human, well, I can scoop your brain out then cut you in half and you'd still be ""human"" with sufficient perfusion of your blood."
"Agreed, which is why I argue that personhood be granted at the moment that the nervous system becomes sufficiently developed as to have some kind of subjective sensory experience. If there is nothing like it is to <em>be</em> that bundle of cells, why do we worry about some bundles of cells (an embryo) and not others (a tumor)."
Great point
"Great question. Took a minute to remember that from genetics/cell biology classes. I do not believe they would have human rights because they will never develop into a fully functioning human being. They would be living human cells and fit the criteria for life, however, I believe they are a unique scenario due to the fact that they will never develop further than a never ending replication cycle."
"But until those dividing cells implant into a uterus, there is no pregnancy. The embryo would be expelled with menstruation. Would the female then be violating the NAP by having a period because the embryo failed to implant?"
I guess I could amend my statement to say that it would be implantation because of this reason but i don’t think it matters to me. A child that is naturally miscarried through the body rejecting it would be a thoughtless and thus non purposeful death in terms of lost child (although nature had a reason to miscarry it usually in terms of corrupted genetic code or hostility toward the mother etc). I think if one does not induce or cause the miscarriage than it is the same as a child who died of SIDS or other similar death. Nature takes over sometimes.
This is because at this point it fulfills the necessary requirements to be considered a living thing
"Bacteria are living things. It doesn't matter whether or not it's a living a thing, it matters whether or not it's a legal person."
Put them together and it becomes a human life
"What matters is whether or not it has developed a working brain and is a conscious person. Humans are the means by which the universe has evolved to observe and understand itself, and the brain is the means by which humans observe and understand the universe."
Requiring women to carry abnormally developing fetus to term which has not and will never develop a working brain or consciousness would be very authoritarian and serve no purpose.
I agree with you but want to play devil's advocate on something you said:
What matters is whether or not it has developed  a working brain and is a conscious person.
"This seems really subjective to me, and its sounds (as I read it) that you're making the claim that consciousness is what defines human life, without explaining why simply being both human (human DNA) and living (replicating cells) does not make something a human life."
"The reason I agree with you is that I personally take a bit of a middle ground, which is that human life does occur at conception (human and living), but that it isn't inherently valuable. The value of human life comes from consciousness, since it is what makes each person unique, and more than just a clump of cells responding to a stimulus like a plant. "
"The problem with abortion (imo) is therefore not the taking of human life, but the talking of a <em>valuable</em> human life, meaning one that is conscious."
"The problem with abortion (imo) is therefore not the taking of human life, but the talking of a valuable human life, meaning one that is conscious."
Define value.   
"Would you be OK then to kill 2 year old children who will never be able to live outside the NICU? As people, their value will almost certainly never exceed their burden on society. Likewise, we would be able to abort children who have a high risk of becoming criminals - yes?"
1) at this point the killing of a 2 year old who would never leave the NICU is euthanasia. It would be a mercy killing. Which is another debate entirely. One that I have no completely made my mind up about
2) value is not necessarily that amount of good a person has on society but having any impact. An analogy to this would be the TIME person of the year. They are significant but not necessarily in a good way. So if you’re talking value a criminal has value. Just not good value. I’m not sure where I land on this part of the debate but it is an interesting brain teaser.
That is a fantastic point that it doesn’t make it inherently valuable. value is a good part to debate as it may change minds in one direction or the other.
"1) I do believe that in certain circumstances, it would be more just and more ethical to terminate if the child had a condition that would develop a short painful life or something of equal magnitude. That is a different discussion. "
2) by your definition than someone who enters a coma is no longer a person.
Preach
Opinion not preach.
Was meant positively charged.  Especially appreciate this observation:
Requiring women to carry abnormally developing fetus to term which has  not and will never develop a working brain or consciousness would be  very authoritarian and serve no purpose.
"Ok. I think ""amen"" would have declared your intention clearer as preaching is considered a negative thing in most secular circles"

"So, in your opinion, are IVF zygotes who undergo PGD and are <em>not</em> implanted into the mother considered murdered humans?"
That is a scenario I had not thought of and would require a greater degree of thought so thanks for the brain workout (no sarcasm). Without that thought my ideation would be that they are not murdered humans because they would not implant without the aid of human assistance. Now I know you could go on to argue that any human aided implantation for people with that issue wouldn’t count as well but I believe there is a difference between naturally conceived and artificially conceived in the situation. Great idea though!
"Thanks for the polite response. My argument here is actually two-fold, first from a biological perspective and second from a libertarian one. "
"I actually don’t actually see reason for a clear distinction between “human aided” and “naturally occurring.”  Similarly to the naturalistic fallacy, if you subscribe to the idea that human behaviors are simply extensions of our biological makeup in the context of the environment, why must we distinguish between what our biology causes our personhood to do from what our biology causes our cells to do? In this sense, every action humans perform is governed by our biology and is therefore natural. And furthermore, whether a pregnancy is started by “natural” conventions shouldn’t be considered distinct from a pregnancy achieved through medical intervention. Which gets us back to the main point, is the zygote <em>always</em> considered human life, even under IVF PGD circumstances? "
"I think your argument of non-autonomy for the embryo—while potentially consistent with your biological view of human life—actually works in favor of a pro-choice model within a libertarian framework. If we grant that the IVF zygotes don’t constitute human life because the are not capable of implanting themselves and surviving on their own without human intervention, then obviously the mother must be an essential supporter of their personhood. Are we really going to argue that the mother should be obliged to support and grant personhood to something, potentially against her consent? Under what conditions should the personhood of something trump the autonomy of another being? I’m having difficulty squaring the idea that something only becomes a person upon it being absolutely dependent on another with upholding the idea of individual liberty."
"If you don't believe in harming ""living things"" what exactly do you eat?"
There is an ethical difference between killing something because it is a nuisance and killing something to use its resources. I don’t believe in killing nuisance but I do believe in killing for food. I have gone as far as to ensure that my friend who kill rabbits and groundhogs because they are nuisances use their meat when it happens.
"Flies, mice, rats, termites, ants, snakes, zygotes, Epstein’s, etc."
"Rocks, air, sunlight, glass shards, etc...."
If my finger gets cut off does that mean that my finger becomes a person because it consists of living human cells? The cells from my finger would certainly live longer on their own than the cells from immediately after conception could live on their own.
"Like I had said in a reply previously, i should clarify that it has a lot to do with potential to develop and potential to become a full grown organism. The cells that are in your cells for skin, muscle, etc. the cells that develop during conception are on an organismal level. That’s why that group of cells is called a zygote and not just a group of cells. Because they are an individual organism."
You say “personally”.  So do you think the government should put a woman in prison for murder if she aborts a 2-cell “human life” that is inside her?  Or not?
"I do not believe that the government should be able to tell a woman that she has to carry an child. I do believe the government can restrict performing the procedure and and I believe that people can take responsibility for their actions. To me it is the same thing as smoking. You know a risk of smoking is lung cancer. If you choose to smoke, you accept that possibility. Practice safe sex or no sex in order to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. In the scenario where pregnancy still happens, there is parenthood or adoption. But that’s my opinion which doesn’t amount to much in the grand scheme of things"
"So... you believe that doctors should be put in prison for murder if they remove two cells from someone’s body, but the patient should not be charged.  Am I getting that right?"
I am not completely sure which direction I would favor if that were on the table. On one hand you may have a doctor who loves to perform this procedure and on the other you have a doctor who performs it reluctantly because they have to for one reason or another. Motivation is powerful in that decision for me so I’m not sure how I land completely. I guess my stance is that it shouldn’t be legal for a doctor to perform the procedure. The next step after that would be a debate that I’d love to hear and decide from there
"But the sex of that human will determine if the NAP applies to them or not. For example, If those replicated cells become female then their body is property of the government."
Technically a man’s body is property of the government as well in the USA because of the draft.
Edit: grammar
Honest question. What are the necessary requirements to be considered a living thing that you mention?
1) Growth - must have the ability to grow and change over time
2) Reproduction - must have the ability to reproduce to have an offspring at the point of sexual maturity in growth cycle
3) Heredity - must have genetic composition that can be passed on to offspring
"4) Homeostasis - must have an ability
maintain a level of consistency"
5) Metabolism - must be able to take in and energy process it
6) Organization - must be take simple structures to make complex ones (cellular organization into different levels)
7) Reactivity to Stimuli - Must have a response to the environment around it
"Sapient thought is the only uniquely human quality.  Unless something might be capable of that it should not have protections under the NAP.  That happens, at the very earliest, quite late in the development of a fetus around the beginning of the third trimester.  At which point elective abortions aren’t performed anyway."
"Development of higher-brain function in cerebral cortex indicating consciousness. This is after 21 weeks in normally developing fetus and never in case of non-viable fetus. There should be no restrictions on abortions of normally developing fetus prior to 21 weeks, plus no restrictions on aborting abnormally developed fetus after 21 weeks if it is non-viable and failed to develop a cerebral cortex or any structures and activity indicating consciousness."
never in case of non-viable fetus.
Never? No. A fetus can form a perfectly functional brain and not have the required parts to live post-partum.
"Within the libertarian framework, the entire question of ""when life begins"" is irrelevant because even if you say the fetus is a fully formed human with rights the argument remains the same and that is this: What human has the right to remain unwanted within the body of another? If we say only the fetus has that right, then we have elevated the rights of the fetus over all other human beings, and rights are no longer equal. We know the existence of rights is attributed to their reciprocity, for if rights are not equal for all human beings, then they cease to exist as rights, but privileges instead."
"A common objection to this is that the mother chose to bear a child in the first place, but making this statement is no different than denying the existence of our own individual sovereignty, which is the central axiom of libertarianism that all other principles derive from. Either individual sovereignty exists, and only the individual has the right to make decisions regarding their own body, or it does not exist, and you now have justification for some to rule over others, thus negating libertarianism."
From a strictly libertarian standpoint I agree but we aren't in an strictly libertarian framework. 
Not all humans have the same rights around all agegroups.
Not all humans have the same rights around all agegroups.
"I would say they do, can you give me an example of where they don't?"
Children. Elderly and demented people. Mental Disabled and people with mental disorders.
Why would they not have rights?
I did not say they have no rights. Just that they don't have the same as an average human adult
What human has the right to remain unwanted within the body of another?
"The human that was willingly put there by the actions of their mother. The one that has no choice but to remain inside the womb, vulnerable."
"If you read past the first sentence, I addressed this."
The human that was willingly put there by the actions of their mother.  
"2 problems with this: 1 - mothers do not reproduce on their own (except in the case of Eric Cartman's mom, but let's leave satire out of it). 2 - not all pregnancies happen willingly"
willingly here is shaky as hell
This is pretty much one of the few libertarian stances where i am 100% in agreement with.
Bodily autonomy must be kept sacrosanct.
"A common objection to this is that the mother chose to bear a child in the first place, but making this statement is no different than denying the existence of our own individual sovereignty"
So no ethical obligation to feed a baby or toddler for that matter.
"Your own personal morality, cultural norms, or societal ethical standards would define this, not libertarianism."
"A common objection to this is that the mother chose to bear a child in the first place, but making this statement is no different than denying the existence of our own individual sovereignty, which is the central axiom of libertarianism that all other principles derive from."
"This is a stupid counterargument, because your logic basically says you shouldn't be bound by any contracts you decided to sign just because they infringe upon your ""individual sovereignty"". You have control over yourself, but you also have the ability to relinquish some control of your own free will. You do this with contracts all the time, and those don't involve things as important as a human life."
"If a Libertarian can be bound by voluntarily agreed upon contracts, which is something that has never been disputed as far as I'm aware, then your entire argument I quoted is irrelevant bullshit."
"At some point that fetus is a person and has equal rights if you believe in individual rights. The mom made the choice to allow herself to get pregnant, then made the choice to not early abort. "
What needs to be defined is at what point is it a baby and an individual.  At that point the baby would have the right to not be murdered 
Your idea is saying moms can murder their baby 
But if you murdered a pregnant mom you’d be arrested for double homicide.
"The mom made the choice to allow herself to get pregnant, then made the choice to not early abort. "
I addressed that objection in my original post.
What needs to be defined is at what point is it a baby and an individual. At that point the baby would have the right to not be murdered 
I addressed how it is inconsequential to the argument whether we see the fetus as an individual with rights or not.
Your idea is saying moms can murder their baby
Whether you call it abortion or murder does not rebut the point that no human being has the right to live unwanted within the body of another. I addressed this as well in my explanation of equality of rights and individual sovereignty.
But if you murdered a pregnant mom you’d be arrested for double homicide.
Legality is irrelevant in discussions of rights.
Yeah the problem is your statements contradict themselves and are based on some weird idea of libertarianism you came up with. 
If you’re just choosing the moms rights over her child’s. It could work either way. If that baby doesn’t have a right to be in the moms body (even though the mom wasn’t forced to be pregnant) then I could just as easily argue that that mom doesn’t have the right to be keeping a baby trapped inside of her. Only way that argument doesn’t work is if we don’t consider it a human life yet which is why we would need to define start of life. 
I could take your argument and argue the mom should be murdered instead of the baby for forcing the baby to be in there. Or maybe argue both need to be murdered. 
You’re thought process contradicts itself if you flip the scenario around. You’re just choosing to give the rights to one human instead of the other. That’s not libertarian
"Yeah the problem is your statements contradict themselves and are based on some weird idea of libertarianism you came up with. 
If you’re just choosing the moms rights over her child’s. It could work either way. If that baby doesn’t have a right to be in the moms body (even though the mom wasn’t forced to be pregnant)"
"You forgot ""unwanted"", ie against the mother's wishes."
then I could just as easily argue that that mom doesn’t have the right to be keeping a baby trapped inside of her. Only way that argument doesn’t work is if we don’t consider it a human life yet which is why we would need to define start of life. 
"You first would have to make the argument that the mother is operating against the wishes of the fetus for your analogy to be valid as I pointed out with the word ""unwanted"" regarding the mother."
I could take your argument and argue the mom should be murdered instead of the baby for forcing the baby to be in there. Or maybe argue both need to be murdered. 
This argument relies on the same fallacious analogy as your previous one.
You’re thought process contradicts itself if you flip the scenario around. You’re just choosing to give the rights to one human instead of the other. That’s not libertarian
"I've just explained to you how ""flipping it around"" isn't analogous to the original argument whatsoever."
"You forgot ""unwanted"", ie against the mother's wishes."
"The hell you mean ? The stork drop it off unwanted ? People make choices, .sometimes bad ones, personal freedom comes with personal responsibility. Should have been more careful or should have at least aborted it before it became a person with its own rights. (When it becomes a person and not a fetus is what needs to be decided)"
Rape would be unwanted. 
"You first would have to make the argument that the mother is operating against the wishes of the fetus for your analogy to be valid as I pointed out with the word ""unwanted"" regarding the mother."
Fetus can’t talk to tell us its wishes . Either can a 1 year old. Under this argument moms can murder their 1 year olds that can’t tell us its desire to live. Or maybe mom didn’t say that 1 year old can live in her house. Maybe mom can leave it on the sidewalk since it’s an unwanted guest in her home. 
"I've just explained to you how ""flipping it around"" isn't analogous to the original argument whatsoever."
No u didn’t. You showed the flaws in your thinking and chose a mother’s rights over her child’s. Under libertarianism ALL humans get equal  rights and personal freedoms.
If a mom get “unwanted” cancer to we start supporting government funded healthcare?
How about “unwanted” going broke? Do we give her free money?
“Unwanted” baby is no different unless it’s rape.
"The hell you mean ? The stork drop it off unwanted ? People make choices, .sometimes bad ones, personal freedom comes with personal responsibility. Should have been more careful or should have at least aborted it before it became a person with its own rights. (When it becomes a person and not a fetus is what needs to be decided)"
Unwanted in this case means the mother no longer wishes to carry the pregnancy. I thought that was clear.
Fetus can’t talk to tell us its wishes . 
"The fetus cannot but the mother can. So there is certainty regarding the mother's desire to make decisions that are in line with her own individual sovereignty. Because the fetus cannot express its desire to escape the womb, you have nothing to base your rationale on that it actually wishes to do so."
Either can a 1 year old. Under this argument moms can murder their 1 year olds that can’t tell us its desire to live. Or maybe mom didn’t say that 1 year old can live in her house. Maybe mom can leave it on the sidewalk since it’s an unwanted guest in her home. 
You are conflating two arguments that are not analogous. Your first point was that the mother may have imprisoned the fetus and so that the fetus should be allowed to leave the womb of the mother. I expressed how this does not correlate in my previous paragraph.
"Your harming a one year old argument is completely different in that you are saying it is okay to commit aggression against another. Not only that, but the sovereignty of the mother is not at play in this analogy either, whereas if the mother were to somehow be able to carry a pregnancy to a full year and the baby was in the womb of the mother it would be."
"As for leaving the child on the sidewalk, that is not an aggression nor is it a libertarian predicament. This would fall in line with a question of societal and cultural norms as to how parents should raise their children. If you were to frame this question within libertarianism, the only conclusion you could draw is that a parent may not be forced to care for a child."
mom doesn’t have the right to be keeping a baby trapped inside of her
"I like this idea. There should be a ""freedom for fetuses (feti?)""- Movement accusing pregnant woman of kidnapping their baby's and infringing on their rights."
If that baby doesn’t have a right to be in the moms body (even though the mom wasn’t forced to be pregnant) then I could just as easily argue that that mom doesn’t have the right to be keeping a baby trapped inside of her.
"Those two arguments end with the same result. So if you argue the perspective about the woman not having the right to keep the fetus trapped inside here...well...remove the fetus. If it's a 2 week old clump of cells, well, you just decided for the baby, and it died (aka an abortion). If it's a 7.5 month fetus, well, it can probably live just fine with a wet nurse.  "
"Either way, it's the same outcome. Abortion or live birth."
"Okay, so what's your solution?"
Allow people to choose for themselves.
So the fetus does not count as a person at any point when it is in the womb?
"Not trying to be an ass, just genuinely curious about your position on the matter"
Thats up to each woman to decide for herself with her doctor.
"Libertarians hate state interference in almost every situation. One of the few responsibilities of the state libertarians agree on is protections of individuals from violations of the NAP, or, failing that, ensuring that justice is brought against the aggressor. Does the fetus deserve state protection? Why or why not?"
"First, <em>some</em> libertarians believe they need the state to protection of the NAP. Plenty of libertarians see the state as the ultimate violator of the NAP.
Second, no, fetuses don't deserve state protection. No one has the positive right to anyone elses resources. The fetuses rights don't supersede the rights of the mother who doesn't want the pregnancy."
"Okay but let's seperate the idea of state interference from the general discussion for a second. OP is essentially asking at what point does the NAP apply, which you frankly haven't answered."
"I'm more than happy to say that regardless of where the NAP applies, the state shouldn't enforce abortion laws, but as a purely moral question, when does a fetus become a person with rights of their own?"
To me it's irrelevant. Those rights will never supercede those of the woman. So from conception to any magic number you want to make up.
"What about children. I mean right after birth until they are about 4 they can't survive without the resources of others. 
Would you agree to let them die if nobody wants to give their personal recourses to them ?"
Of course. I can't imagine that happening. I think plenty of people are looking to adopt.
Then the best solution by your standards for unwanted pregnancy would be to develop a procedure that allows non pregnant woman to take the unborn fetus from the unwanting mother to the wanting mother ? 
I know that such a thing wont be happening in the next decade
"At a point, yes, I believe it is.  I also don't approve of abortion personally."
"However, those beliefs are superseded by my belief that individuals should be free to make their own decisions about their own bodies."
Should a 2 year old have the right to buy alcohol? Should a 4 year old have the right to buy a gun? Should a 6 year old have the right to get married?  
Rights are not given all at once. Why not simply say that we do not have the right to life until born? That would easily fall in line with all other rights and laws.
My solution to what exactly?
Whether the fetus is a person that has rights
Did you not read a single word I wrote? I addressed that question in the very first sentence.
"You said it's irrelevant. That's not an answer, that's ""I don't wanna touch this because I don't wanna have to deal with moral dilemmas"""
"Either the fetus deserves rights or it does not. There is no ""does not compute""."
"You said it's irrelevant. That's not an answer, that's ""I don't wanna touch this because I don't wanna have to deal with moral dilemmas"""
What exactly is the moral dilemma here from a libertarian perspective? The argument is exactly the same whether you declare the fetus as a human being with rights or you do not.
"Either the fetus deserves rights or it does not. There is no ""does not compute""."
"I'm giving you the upper hand by allowing you the opportunity to choose. If you want to say that the NAP applies to the fetus because they are a human being with rights, that's fine. Everything I've written still stands on its own. The point is that you are asking this on a libertarian forum and so you will receive a libertarian answer. If you wanted to address issues of morality, then why not ask this on a sub that is relevant to morality, such as a religious or philosophy sub."
"So, by you last sentence, it is relevant if the fetus is a person because if it is, it is not being given the right to make decisions regarding its body?"
"Regarding its own body? It certainly has that right. Regarding the body of the mother and her choice as to what's inside her body? No one has that right except the mother herself. If you say the fetus has the right to remain unwanted within the body of the mother, then the mother's rights are no longer equal to that of the fetus."
"So, ignoring rape, at what point does the mother have to take responsibility for her actions in creating the fetus?"
"Before we go further, why would you ignore rape if your previous argument is that the fetus is ""not being given the right to make decisions regarding its body""? The fetus still exists whether the woman is raped or sex is consensual after all."
Kinda.   
"If the fetus is 7 months along, the woman can have a surgical procedure performed, and then a ""wet nurse"" can care for the fetus. Said another way, the fetus is able to accept voluntary care.  "
"If the fetus is 3 weeks along, the woman can have a surgical procedure performed, and no wet nurse could care for the fetus even if they wanted to. Said another way, the fetus is unable to accept voluntary care.  "
"Up until a certain point, the fetus is <strong>only</strong> viable as a parasite - and no amount of volunteer care or charity  of others can assist in keeping it alive."
At the moment of conception it becomes unjustifiable not to consider the being as a moral agent.
Thank you. What is your opinion on the fetus living within another person without permission?
It is a question of weighing the costs of carrying the fetus vs the moral value gained for giving the fetus life. 
"Are you expected to take care of 1,000 fetuses here? No, it's just one. Does the inconvenience of eating healthy and giving birth really outweigh all of the positives that the child would bring into the world? Of course not. "
You wouldn't think it was justified to kill someone just because they made your life more inconvenient. Why is it any different with fetuses?
"If you come onto my property and threaten me, i can kill you in self defense. Is that inconvenience of someone robbing you enough to warrant killing someone? "
"A woman does not risk a 0% chance of dying during giving birth, so what is your cut-off for odds of death? Can I rob you and you can't do anything because your chance of dying is only 1%? Or is 1% still enough to justify your use of force against me?"
"The fetus is not holding a gun to you threatening your life. If the fetus does pose some threat to the mother's life, then yes, that's a completely different situation. "
Or is 1% still enough to justify your use of force against me?
"If I'm on the train with someone and there is a 1% chance they are dangerous, No, that does not give me the justification to kill them. And in the vast, vast majority of pregnancies the fetus poses a far less risk of 1% to the mother."
The fetus is not holding a gun to you threatening your life. 
"You need to look into childbirth, while not a gun, it is threatening your life. I guess if I walk up to you with acid, that isn't a gun, so I can threaten you with acid?"
<em>You</em> need to look into childbirth. The percentage of mothers that die from childbirth is 0.0238%. That is about 700 people a year. 
Are you saying that this chance of death is somehow the same as someone threatening you with acid?
Do you not see how odd of a question you pose? 
Permission?  How do you suppose the baby got in there in the first place? 
You make it seem like the baby crept  into the mothers room one night and and sneakily slipped into her uterus and is now an unwanted squatter on her property.  It seems very disingenuous to frame it that way. 
The people in here who are ready kill babies in the womb all Willy nilly without giving it much thought scare me. Too many thoughtless evil people on here.
At the moment of conception it becomes unjustifiable not to consider the being as a moral agent.
A clump of cells isn't a moral agent.
clump of cells tho 
All humans are nothing but clumps of cells.
You were probably downvoted because this topic is annoying and just brings the same voices out arguing with each other.
I'm sorry for bringing an annoying discussion of morality into your life.
I didn't downvote you... I'm simply noting the topic of abortions basically weekly.
"God I wish it was weekly, that would be a nice break."
What is the point of discussing morality of a natural process?
Miscarriages are extremely common. What is a miscarriage? It is a spontaneous abortion
Up to 50% percent of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortions. Hard to truly know because many miscarriages are so uneventful that the woman thinks it was just a delayed and bigger than usual period.
All doctors do is bump up that number by a few more percentage points. Quite often to keep the mother alive so that she might be able to give birth in the future without dying or during a time of her life when she can actually support the child.
I disagree. In case of no legislated abortions the number of late term abortions would definitely rise way above the natural rate.
Except that it is simply not true and you are free to show me evidence to prove me wrong. No doctor and no parent wants to perform late term abortions unless they absolutely have to. 3rd trimester abortions are only done in the cases where the mother's life is at risk.
Except that it is simply not true and you are free to show me evidence to prove me wrong.
How could I ? There are no viable counties with no registration discussing abortions. 
I half this opinion as this is the direction progressives push. The last time was the proposed legislation in NYC which would have allow abortions up to birth as long as the mother selfdiagnosed with being incapable of conceiving it. The legislation that sparked the regressive wave regarding abortion laws around the us.
Except that law stated no such thing and you know it:
"The RHA legalized abortion at any time ""when necessary to protect a woman's life or health"".[15][21] or in the absence of fetal viability.[2] The act allows licensed health care practitioners other than physicians to perform abortions if doing so falls within their lawful scope of practice."

When they can survive on their own they become a person.
So newborn babies are not people?
I think this commenter means at the point of viability.
Viability is a matter of geography more than anything.
"yes, if by geography you mean ""inside another human being"" or ""outside another human being"""
"No, I mean a child born prematurely in NYC has a greater likelihood of being ""viable"" than a child born prematurely in the middle of Appalachia."
"Sounds like you have the solution then. If we can save the child, we can, if not then we can't. "
"You know that medicine also differs, so do humans in Appalachia have a less right to life than people in NYC?"
"I think your question is misdirected. I was a hospital corpsman and now I'm an OR nurse, so I'm aware of the limits of medicine. I simply made a statement implying that ""viability outside the womb"" is not a consistent measurement, and is largely technology based."
"I get that, and I think it is fine. Viability doesn't need to mean a specific time. We try our best, but if we can't, then we can't. Just because a fetus is viable in NYC doesn't mean we need to force someone in appalachia to give birth."
Thank you
"Can they breathe and survive on their own without a parasitic attachment to another life? Yes they can, so they're people."
"I mean, it's a gradient. They can breath. They MAY be able to drink water. They certainly can't eat. Does a parasitic attachment require a direct, physical attachment?"
"Being defined as parasitic requires that it feeds off of, and causes harm to, the host. A baby, once born, can be fed by any woman, or even formula, so it no longer requires feeding off of its host. In fact it no longer has a specific host at all. And it no longer has the ability to cause direct harm to a woman's body once it has exited the woman's body."
"Does a parasitic attachment require a direct, physical attachment?"
"A fetus, before a certain point, cannot exist without parasitism. You could have a million wet nurses standing by waiting to care for the fetus - but there is simply no way a 6 week old fetus can accept voluntary care of another.  "
"Contrast with a 7 month old fetus; you can remove it and, more than likely, a wet nurse can care for them just fine. That fetus has matured to the point that it is able to accept voluntary care. It does not exist only via parasitism."
"Maybe we should say when they are no longer dependent on only ONE other person. Anyone can make formula and give it to a newborn, but only one woman can incubate the egg."
For how long? In what environment?
You shouldn't be down-voted OP -- this is a great instigator of philosophical discussion and I have been enjoying the comments in this thread.
"From a personal sovereignty standpoint, it would stand to reason that one has complete ownership of one's own physical vessel and total freedom to do with it as they please (including voluntary euthanasia), short of directly harming another sovereign being. "
"Nature and a significant portion (if not the majority) of historically observed cultural and religious practice has indicated that children are not sovereign, especially while wholly dependent upon their guardians."
"This uncomfortable observation is crassly depicted by the practice of infanticide, which is widespread throughout the animal kingdom and most cultures. Pragmatic cases where mothers will cull offspring that would not otherwise survive due to scarcity or deformity abound across many species (human included)."
"This seems to suggest that children are essentially the personal property of their parents, at least until they mature into the basic capacity to apprehend sovereignty (or some such point). Balancing this with an ""ethical imperative"" to sleep soundly at night knowing that your neighbor is not abusing this responsibility makes this an interesting puzzle."
"If a woman is pregnant with a deformed child that will most certainly live a few miserable years before perishing, it seems hard to fault her for wishing to provide a (merciful) early end to said suffering (especially if scarcity would add additional suffering to her other children) within a Natural Law framework."
"I have wondered if perhaps the question isn't necessarily what number of cells must divide before Pinocchio becomes a ""real boy"", but instead seeking to better understand the responsibility sovereign beings have in the act of bringing new life into this world and what practice would grow a greater respect for this responsibility."
I personally do not really have a problem with putting it at conception or at reaching of self consciousness. 
"I happily accept the public decision after democratic standards. 
As long as we don't intensify abortion. I would find it really wrong due to health and mental risks if it would be treated as another form of contraceptives"
"I honestly don't know. I'm not a scientist or theologian, even though I have training in both. I know that life begins even before conception, as both egg and sperm are made of living cells, but neither is a person, nor can become one without the other. Life alone is not enough, but must be something more. I'd say when the fetus develops a soul, but we cannot measure such a thing among people now. This is why I do not  wish government to interfere, but I would personally attempt to persuade against an abortion."

So in my perception of morals, as soon as the couple finds out, they decide. I could even see a 1st trimester decision. But none of this pre-birth shit.  "
​
"And medical issues are a different issue. Each is unique and is between mother, doctor, and father."
If you're dead when your brain stops working then the start of brain activity is the beginning of life.
"When the fetus is able to live naturally outside the womb - even if it currently is not living outside the womb. What point is this? It varies from pregnancy to pregnancy. But most assuredly, that covers the first trimester in totality.  "
"Before that point, the fetus can only continue to live via parasitic action off the host, and is incapable of being cared for by a willing 3rd party.  "
"And I don't think there's some switch which keeps this going past birth; if you become a vegetable, then you either rely on the charity of others or you die. If there is no one who will voluntarily care for you, you cannot force them to do so."
My body my choice. Thankfully I will never have to make that decision.  I will utilize my second amendment right to defend my body from the state or federal government intervention
"Conception. Unique DNA to the new individual separate from their mother and father. Whether or not one believes in souls, DNA shapes humans and allows for what makes us different. People are arguing development of the facilities needed for higher levels of intellect yet this does not implicate actual intelligence or experience. There are animals smarter than a new born and experience/memory is a slippery slope to define human life, both of these options can be used to argue for the killing of a 1 year old baby. Conception and DNA is not bound by geography or arbitrary comparison to other fully grown animals. It is at conception the ability for a sentient being is established."
"They are a person and have protection under the NAP at conception because they are then a genetically unique individual. Any sign of life you pick starts way early in development--so early I cannot distinguish between the fetus when it has it and when it doesn't. Heartbeat, fingerprints, an ability to respond to stimulae--they happen so early I have to say that life begins at conception.
This view solves nothing. It complicates the issue of the mother's health in... not perfectly healthy pregnancies. Rape becomes even worse, if that's possible.
I know this is not the majority opinion but I cannot hold another position."
"Downvoted because it's a difficult question, and killing your problems away is highly convenient."
the argument of whether its alive doesn't really matter. even if it was alive we and the state can't compel someone to use their body against their will.
to put it in Right Libertarian speak your not entitled to someone else's house your not entitled to someone else's food your not entitled to someone else's womb.
"the robust augment of this is laid out in Judith Jarvis Thomson's ""<em>A Defense of Abortion</em>"" and her Violinist example"
"and <a href=""https://youtu.be/c2PAajlHbnU?t=1"" rel=""nofollow"">a snazzy video showing the violinist  problem</a> if that's more peoples speed."
Will be interesting to see what happens when we eventually get technology that allows us to remove the fetus at any stage of development from the mother and let it finish it's development in an artificial environmental and be adopted.
I have a feeling many women will still insist on abortion for whatever reason but i hope im wrong.
"Id just like to see us take the  ""its stuck in my body"" part of the argument out of the equation. If we can safely and easily remove the fetus from the mother we could hypothetically end all abortions."
"You honestly could have thrown me into a dumpster after being birthed, and it wouldn't have mattered."
My earliest memory is maybe when I was 3 or maybe even 2?
I think there is seriously too much fighting over fetus sensitivity due to religious nonsense.
I suppose once a baby can survive outside of a whom without major life support seems like a realistic logical choice to me.
The scientific benefit and economic relief alone would be worth the policy.
At birth.
My delineating factor is when a fetus can life out of the womb...third trimester.
7 months
Any particular reason why?
Not really I think it as that points it’s like you have committed to your baby
"Cool, thanks for sharing your opinion"
Your welcome
As soon as it is possible for the fetus to survive outside the womb.
I would say for now whether the thing can survive outside the womb with medical technology. The heart beat also is a reasonable rule.
"We declare fully formed adults with heartbeats to be dead, and thus no longer fully human, all the time."
Heartbeat is not at all a reasonable rule. Heartbeat bills are authoritarian and repressive. The presence of a heartbeat does not indicate the fetus is viable or has developed into a legal person capable of conscious thought. A normally developing fetus does not develop higher brain structures and functions necessary to support consciousness until after 21 weeks. An abnormally developing fetus may never develop a brain or consciousness. Requiring mothers to carry abnormally developing fetus which will be born  without a brain to birth through the use of abortion restrictions simply because a heartbeat was detected early in the pregnancy is unreasonable and oppressive.
"Im all for killing babies, is this a new view point?"
"Killing babies is so wasteful, please eat them like us atheists do. Waste not want not."
When the nervous system becomes sufficiently developed as to have a subjectively “human” experience. To our best knowledge this occurs between weeks 16 and 20 of the pregnancy.
"So, there are many many answers.  All are just as correct as each other.  One view is that the baby is a parasite, and cannot live outside of the mother and is violating the NAP.  So they will put the timeframe at near birth to a few weeks before birth. Some would argue upon conception in which the mothers voluntary choice goes into effect (ignoring cases of sexual assault) and the NAP would be broken with the use of an abortion.<br/>
The argument is not fueled on what the NAP is, but rather what a baby is, what murder is, and who violates the NAP first.  (And in such if whether consensual sex is a legal defense for the baby.)"
It is such a mess the years the libertarian community apart when there is no correct answer.
"In my non-medical opinion, I consider viability outside the womb as the deciding factor. Although, I have an alternative answer, but I always get pushback regardless of how logically sound it is. A fetus, once implanted in the uterus, can be removed intact from the woman. Then, the two are separate, individual lives and can go on from there. Just because the fetus can't survive without the woman is of no concern of the woman. If the fetus is truly its own independent person, to which the NAP applies, it has a right, and responsibility, to live without the forced labor of another person. Remove the fetus from the woman, and go from there."
"When it develops consciousness. And I have no idea when that happens, let alone what consciousness is. If I were to speak for myself, my earliest memories are from around being 3 year old, so I cannot even say for sure that I was conscious and existed as a person before that, and possibly that baby could have been safely killed without violating my rights."
Once it can voice its opposition to being aborted
so sometime around three years after being born? This is when most humans develop the ability to speak in complete enough sentences to voice their opposition.
I’ve always thought of it as whenever a baby / fetus can survive on its own outside of the womb - which would inevitably be a moving line as medical technology improves and evolves - before then it’s basically a parasite living off the host mother.
"Birth. Prior to that, they are not American, or any other nationality, and no laws make sense... insurance, two way rape, I guess, extradition... literally nothing that would apply to human beings applies pre-birth."
"Human rights don't only apply to US citizens. Laws don't define what a human is or isn't entitled to. Laws reflect our ideas of morality, not the other way around"
"I do not disagree at all. But 100% of the laws of America (and every country I know of) treat the fetus as not human, while it is alive in the womb.  The only exception I know of is when the fetus dies in utero. (It is treated as human after death, which is arguably consistent with waiting until it is separated from its mother). So the ""morality"" that is reflected by majorities in 100% of countries on earth is to treat a fetus as not human until birth."
Thank you for sharing
Brain function. When the baby can feel. 
You’re down voted because this sub is infested with far leftist disguised as libertarians
Great question that rarely goes anywhere. It’s a topic people can’t handle discussing.
or because this is asked like daily... there is a search function.
Daily huh... weird
People discuss this here multiple times a day. wtf are you talking about?
Either 21 weeks or emancipation.
Ya! We should be able to abort teenagers!
How come?
21 weeks is the earliest a fetus is viable outside the womb.
At viability even with medical assistance. And the trend is towards technology making the time shorter and shorter.
"Birth, for purely practical reasons. It's easy to measure and it's when that person gets documented. People who get abortions largely are in a poor position to give that baby a decent life and are far more likely to raise a criminal who would be a drain on society."
"Because this question is asked for often, I'll go the extreme, I believe at any point a person endangers others life, that person has the right to end you. Childbirth is not risk free, just like you robbing me gives me the right to defend myself, I should have the right to defend myself from death by childbirth. "
"The child has violated the NAP, I can defend myself as much as I can defend my castle."
I'm no doctor or biologist. I would say some short time before the fetus can survive outside of the mother.
I actually kinda like the way Islam deals with it.   before 4 months its fine.  After 4 months its murder.  Very black and white.
Her family is skeptical of the sheriff narrative. 
"So, they have at least 2 brain cells still rubbing together.  Anyone that believes this narrative probably also believes Epstein killed himself."
"sorry but I dont believe that a man and a woman officer raped her. Its just too unlikely. that her escape was an evil act of revenge is more believable, but also unlikely. The Libertarian crowd gets on the anti-police bandwagon more than they should. Libertarians are like young adults with their <em>fuck the police</em> mentality."
They murdered her. Whether the rape happened or not is irrelevant at this point
"Thank you for your input <a href=""/u/alovelycumdumpster"">u/alovelycumdumpster</a>"
Fucking lmao
How is rape unlikely? this shit happens all the time haha?
"cmon, man. cops, who are already under the microscope in today's political climate, raping someone at their facility? And a woman helped with some anal? I dont think so."
They get away with it constantly. They have no oversight. That’s why they do it. All. The. Time.
Dear lovelycumdumpster... there are many woman sex offenders and rapists who exclusively target the same sex and many documented cases of male female couple rapists who kidnap or abduct and rape together.
"I just googled ""Police Sexual Assault 2019"" and the name of my city and got  pages of examples. "
"Also here is Bowling Greens convicted <a href=""https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/Home/Crimes#"">Police Crimes data base</a> feel free to peruse the thousands of examples they have compiled showing that today's political climate doesn't keep rapists out of the police force."
"And even if she was lying, do you really think that it's just a coincidence she died <em>falling from a moving vehicle</em> while in custody by accident shortly after? to quote you ""c'mon man. I don't think so."
You should really do some research into rape statistics of cops. Shits fucking gross. They also happen to commit domestic abuse at 50% more than the national average.
"This is where pretend Libertarians who like the taste of calling themselves Libertarians but are actually just Authoritarians who don't like welfare, come to meet."
"If you dont think cops are necessary, youre an absolute fool"
Are cops necessary?  Probably.
Are cops absolutely out of control in this country?  Without a fucking doubt.
"last 20 years Ive gotten two speeding tickets and they were both my fault. There was one time that cops tried to get my information when all they had to do was leave me alone, but it resulted in nothing bad and it did originate because of an actual potential crime going down. This is 20 years time frame. So, while I admit that big city cops with a large  black population (and heavy crime) may  act different, I dont see a ton of bad cop behavior on my side. But then again, I do live in mostly white and low-crime Idaho."
"You should read the writings of the late great <a href=""http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">William Norman Grigg</a>.  He was a resident of Idaho, and he chronicled a lot of really fucked up shit that goes on with Idaho and Oregon cops (he mostly covered Malheur county for Oregon)."
Lucky you lol
"no, its not ""lucky me"". thats how things are. If you stay out of trouble, you probably wont get messed with."
I’ve seen far too much of the opposite hold true. Hasn’t happened to me and I consider myself lucky for that. The police are running rampant and just because they haven’t done it to you doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. Expand your worldview.

"EDIT: Sorry, hit reply to thh wrong person."
Well that's an interesting misread of my statement.
Edit: I always forget these are intentional strawmen.  Keep wailing on that bodypillow I guess.
ok while Im not an authoritarian just because I am pro-cop either.
"You shouldn't be pro-cop.  Policing is a job, stop being a fanboy for authoritarians."
"Explain how she managed to escape from handcuffs, a belly chain and ankle restraints in the back of the police car without the officers noticing. Also feel free to explain how she managed to open the back door of a police cruiser from the inside which is ALWAYS locked"
"Libertarians should be on the “anti-police bandwagon.” The mere existence of law enforcement, as it exists today, is an inherent affront to individual liberty."
Let’s see the car footage then. They shouldn’t have an issue releasing that.
Fuck you too haha
"Any cops out there want to tell me how easy it is to slip out of hand cuffs? I admittedly don't have a lot of experience with them, and maybe  I just haven't watched enough cop shows. But it seems like they should be hard to get off...unless she put them on herself?"
"Trust me, you aren't getting out of them unless you dislocate your thumb and even then it could be questionable."
"That's what I figured. But then I thought maybe there were some sort of ""minimum security"" handcuffs."
Not that I'm thinking that this isn't a giant cover-up.
Or if you keep cuff keys hidden somewhere on you.
There are two sets of locks for modern cuffs.  The key and the secondary lockout.
"No way she got out of the hand cuffs. But even more shocking she also got out of the ankle and belly restraints. And after all of they managed to open the locked door, and jump free. No one can do this.."
"Cops can get away with murder in this day and age of ""blue line"" worship. "
"Arizona, in particular, is known for law enforcement corruption, exemplified by Joe Arpaio, who framed a citizen for a crime and was pardoned by Trump after being found guilty of criminal contempt."
Exemplified by Arpaio and punctuated by Steven fucking Seagal driving a tank into someone's house.
Had to Google this Steven Seagal tank thing. I am so disappointed I couldn't find a video.
Blue Privilege is unreal.
There's just so much that's hinky with this story. She got out of not one but TWO sets of cuffs. I could be mistaken but I thought all police cruisers had permanent anti open from the inside doors. And no mention of body worn or inside dash cameras.
She got out of not one but TWO sets of cuffs. 
"2 sets of cuffs, but also a belly restraints."
So much for innocent until proven guilty
The entire system is a bad apple.
"This is the real problem. Bad apples don't ruin the bunch, but if your system allows bad apples get to customers and harm them, the system has failed. "
"Bad apples will always exist, so there must be a thorough system in place to stop them from causing harm."
"And there isn't one, it's gonna stay this way until there's a universal overhaul of the way police are policed. It's sad that we both pay these guys and can't trust them"
Bad apples absolutely ruin the bunch.  Both literally and figuratively.
A fEw BAd AppLES!!!!
I've actually had a bad apple.  
"It was tart, but it sure as hell didn't rape me and throw me out of a moving vehicle."
Beat me to it
"Copied from <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DescentIntoTyranny/comments/elrjik/woman_who_accused_2_cops_of_rape_dies_after/"">here</a> because cross-posting doesn't work."
A couple of highlights:
"Jorden Marie Simms was said to have slipped out of her handcuffs, belly chain and ankle restraints before opening the rear door"
"The sheriffs' office says deputies transported Simms to the Cochise County Advocacy Center following her accusation against the female deputy which is supposed to specialize in examining victims of sexual assault. But they did not have the necessary equipment to test her, so they transported her to Mt. Graham Regional Hospital instead which was when she fell out of the vehicle."
"Simms was arrested on December 21 on a warrant out of Yavapai County. Two days later, she was transported to be tested for signs of rape. Her family says on Facebook that the test came back positive but Arizona state police have not confirmed that."
"So basically, 2 subhuman pieces of shit raped and murdered a woman, and every other subhuman piece of shit in that department (remember, cops aren't people) is remaining silent about it."
"Not one ""good cop"" will come forward."
"Not one ""good cop"" will testify against his brothers in blue."
"Not one ""good cop"" will seek justice for this."
"Every cop is the enemy of every innocent person.  They are not there to stop criminals, they are not there to defend innocents, they are not there to pursue justice--they are there to enforce <strong>THEIR WILL</strong> onto you.  No matter what that is.  And no matter what they do to you, no cop will ever fight back on your behalf."
Cops are the enemies of all free people.
"You had me in the first half but damn, point out on the doll where the bad man touched you."
After that have a Snickers..
I thought the same. Like how do you copy those facts and jump to that conclusion.
"I'll tell you what: if even 1 cop from that department comes forward to bring these 2 rapists and murderers to justice, I'll retract my statement."
Not every cop.  Just <em>1</em>.  Just <strong>ONE</strong> cop has to come forward and show that they care about justice more than protecting their cop brothers.
"Watch.  None will.  And you'll keep thinking there are ""good cops"" out there who will help you.  The reality is those ""good cops"" are more than willing to look the other way while the ""bad cops"" rape and murder you."
"Have fun waiting for the ""good cops"" to come save you.  They never will.  Because there are no good cops.  Period."
"The look the other way thing scares me the most. It's such a common pattern when something evil is happening. Just look throughout history and there are people who just keep their heads down to protect themselves rather than pointing out an injustice due to the consequences they may face. Be it statism, gangs, etc."
Every cop is the enemy of every free person.
"If you think otherwise, you're a bootlicker.  And when the cops do this to someone you love, no one will come to help you.  You chose to side with them."
Have fun with that.
Exactly.
"In MA, 10 years ago, the cops were raiding private homes for SUSPECTED cannabis possession."
"Now that weed is legal, the cops are directing you where to park at the dispensary."
"But for a stroke of the governor's pen, those same cops would <em>willingly and eagerly go right back to enforcing cannabis prohibition at gunpoint by tomorrow morning.</em>"
Cops are not your friends - they are armed lapdogs for the State.
"Cops: ""We don't make the laws, WE JUST ENFORCE THEM."" "
Exactly!
"If weed became illegal again tomorrow, who would enforce it? The cops."
"If black slavery become legal again tomorrow, who would enforce it? The cops."
"If gay marriage became illegal again tomorrow, who would enforce it? The cops."
"If women lost the right to vote tomorrow, who would enforce it? The cops."
Etc.
"Cops are NOT your friends - that's why any lawyer worth the suit they are wearing will tell you ""never speak to the police""."
The cop didn't pull you over to give you a hug and hand you $5; he pulled you over because he's <em>accusing you of</em> <strong><em>something</em></strong> and intends to violate your privacy (search) and/or take your money/freedom (citation/arrest).
"Nobody EVER says, ""Oh good, a cop is pulling me over. I feel safe and protected now!"""
This is especially rich coming from you since you worship and submit to Trump and Trump vehemently defends Civil Asset Forfeiture.

"Need a napkin for all that spittle, Nancy?"

You go girl... fight the power.
Wow. Honestly I’m impressed that you can hear anything with your head so far up your ass. Good for you.
I think this may be the first time I actually agreed with raunchy potato
Same here. I'm especially surprised since his flair seems like he's mocking All Cops Are Bad in favor of some stupid reeing about Communists.
It's possible to think that All Cops are Bastards and All Commies Are Bitches at the same time.  It just means I hate all statists.
Cops are not humans
You need therapy
Cops are weapons of the state. They’re a uniform. Not a person
"Aww, another bootlicker all upsetti spaghetti that people are finally standing up to cops."
"Yeah, you're really sticking it to the cops buy calling them inhuman on Reddit."
Go you.
Cops are exactly the Standing Army the Founding Fathers warned us about.
Haha yea right
But Sheriff Alfred said 
"""It was learned staff had loosened the ankle restraints due to Jorden Simms complaining they were rubbing her ankles and causing pain. A small tube of shower gel with the cap open was found in the back seat where Jorden Simms had been seated,"" the Graham County Sheriff's Office said."
"Sheriff Allred’s family member a while back,  cousin or brother, held his ex wife and family at gun point for drug money but some how escaped with out getting shot. The male Allred ( I’m pretty sure it’s spelled Alred ) was caught the next day or something. "
"The Graham county jail district was voted in to build a new jail, but I find it amazing that if persons are intoxicated they are transported to Mt Graham hospital because the new jail cannot deal with drunk inmates. "
"Why was she transported back to Mt Graham regional hospital and not the hospital in Wilcox is beyond me, or kept in the jail in Wilcox until the investigation could be concluded. Wilcox is a lot closer to Cochise than Safford. "
The locals are pretty upset with this too.

"In a sane world, the Soleimani strike would be included as an article of impeachment."
Why?
Didn't you get the memo? Killing terrorist leaders responsible for the murder of hundreds of Americans is now considered a bad thing.
Not informing congress that you are planning to bomb the second highest ranking member of a foreign government is a bad thing.
The fact probably wouldn’t be leaked or anything.
"""He was a major threat to the United States and needed to be killed"" -guy who just learned of Soleimani in 2020"
Consider the source
Why does the source matter? Did Mike Lee not say this? The source is Mike Lee.
"The briefing source, Pompeo and company"
"With him and Rand, that's a 51-49 vote. Who are the two next most likely Republicans to get on board?"
"This is true, the political divide in America is like a first world problem compared to places where political decisions make the difference on if people get to eat at all."
"It’s crazy to me in how privileged most Americans are, myself included and so many have zero appreciation for it. Let’s sit back with our $5 lattes and criticize everything about America through our $1000 iPhones. I guess I don’t know what I expect when our mainstream media is literally spewing garbage to people every hour of every day. America is far from perfect but I swear people don’t realize how good they have it. There will always be people who have more and less than you do. If you earn over $32,400 a year you are in the top 1% of earners in the world."
"If you earn over $32,400 a year you are in the top 1% of earners in the world."
"That is a meaningless statistic when you also cant afford a shelter, etc on that 32k."
There is a reason America doesnt use world wide poverty levels for its poverty levels. Its not rationale.
"Owning said shelter is a privilege not a right. I’ve seen houses in some parts of the country for $50k but the national avg is $200,000. Avg salary in the US is $59,000"
"Average house prices in the UK are £232,00 ($301K) and the avg salary is £30,000 ($39,000). "
"America isn’t the only place where it’s hard to own a home for the “average” person. The poverty levels in America, while they are terrible, are no where near what some countries are. America needs plenty of fixing but that doesn’t change the fact that we are much better off than most"
If bernie gets his way our political discourse will be just that.
Why?
"""Breadline Bernie"" is the reference. As in Bernies policies will break America and make USA like this dystopia place."
Well I'm hoping GenitalDiddler will outline what Bernie's policies are and how they will bring breadlines back to America.
"<a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/politics/vintage-bernie-footage-shows-now-presidential-candidate-praising-breadlines-communist-nations.amp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/politics/vintage-bernie-footage-shows-now-presidential-candidate-praising-breadlines-communist-nations.amp</a>"
He is pro breadline man.
First I knownits fox news. Dont read the article. Watch the video
K... Now what are Bernie's policies and how will they lead to those breadlines he loves?
You just watched a video where he praises breadlines and expect me to keep arguing my position? Your like a republican watching the pussy grabbing video. Fuck off.
Edit: or watch impeachment hearings. Or watching the verge of war. Or watching a republican do gun control. The mental gymnastics are the exact same.
"Yes, because you haven't explained how comments Sanders made in the 1980s would cause breadlines under a 2020 Sanders presidency."
"From a libertarian P.O.V. a Sanders presidency is in the realm of, ""Uh, no thanks."" But I'm skeptical that it would lead to breadlines. Especially since his current outlook seems to be admiration for European democratic socialism, and they don't seem to be awash in breadlines."
"So, if you would."
When was the last time he praised Venezuela?
"OP, ""The other party is not out to destroy our country"""
"GentialDiddler, ""The democrats want to destroy us!"""
No just bernie.
"including senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) — are still in office, and therefore presumably not averse to sharing their views."
You posted an article bashing fox news for not interviewing Democrats. If it isnt Tulsi.... no airtime on fox news man.
Retardican president always makes these stupid posts.
Nothing wrong with a reminder of just how bad the media is at representing sane politics.
Only took the WaPo 19 years to come up with this idea.
that's completely wrong.
"Here is a chart showing how democrats voted the same whether it was obama or trump bombing syria.   The republicans changed their vote by a whopping  64% difference.  Republicans obey their masters, party party party."
"<a href=""https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt"">https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt</a>"
"What you see in the current situation is the reaction to a random poorly thought out attack that the pentagon and all advisers advised against.  Yet somehow republicans completely change their tune to support whatever the party does,  because they obey."
Don't post evidence. Let the free market of emotion decide how everyone feels about this.
Yeah it might be completely wrong but it <em>feels</em> right so that’s what matters to me.
It’s almost like the article is talking about specific politicians and not the voting public.
"Even over at arcon, people wanting peace were downvoted and many were excited about going to war. "
"I bet today they will claim trump won, and will claim they want peace more that trump said it."
"If the antiwar protesters in the street (who vanished '08-'16) were as principled, we'd be getting somewhere."
Too bad Democrats didn't hold Obama accountable when he was drone striking American citizens without due process.
"Did he go to Congress for that authorization, also?"
They did.
"Not to mention Trump has increased these attacks by a factor of 10,  and even made laws to hide reporting of these attacks.  "
It's too bad you don't hold republicans accountable.   Shame.
They did? When and where? Pretty sure he served out his term and you bootlickers just waved it away as if it never happened.
What Trump did has nothing to do with the fact that Democrats had no problems with Obama killing an American citizen without due process. They've also never provided any evidence whatsoever as to their justifications for killing him.
please stop lying. 
You are literally responding to a post showing the strong disagreement from democrats about the bombing.  lmao.
"The person you are speaking with has no intention of responding in good faith.  No matter what you say or do, they will only respond with attacks on Democrats, because they are a troll, and that's their sole purpose"
The linked image does no such thing.  It is a poll of voters not politicians (the subject of the reason article).   If you read the article you would note the fact that a similar vote to admonish the president during Obama’s presidency after air strikes in Libya failed to garner enough Democratic support to pass.   With the same democrats now supporting a similar resolution under Trump.   Hence the title of the article.
When and where was Obama held accountable for killing an American citizen without due process? Was he impeached? Imprisoned? Charged? 
"As far as I'm aware, nothing whatsoever happened to him and he served out the rest of his term. That's because none of you bootlickers actually care about abuses of power so much as you care about which side is committing the abuses."
Any thoughts on this?
"<a href=""https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt"">https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt</a>"
Probably more deflection/whataboutism.
A poll of the voting public says nothing about how current and former democrats and Republican congressmen vote and which policies they support. 
My guess is you didn’t read the article.
"The House GOP would have been the ones to Impeach him, and they declined to do so, you fucking retard"
That's because none of you bootlickers actually care about abuses of power
"This is hilarious coming from someone whose <em>sole focus</em> is attacking anyone even mildly to the left of center.  You never say shit about Trump and the stooges in GOP, I mean, never.  "
"Sheesh, talk about projection"
"Did Democrats push articles of impeachment for the GOP to submit, Hillary bootlicker? I don't remember the topic even being discussed on either side."
One would think the GOP would have jumped at the opportunity to impeach him if the Democrats wanted to.
"You're a fucking retard, man"
"Got it, so Democrats didn't actually do anything about Obama drone striking an American citizen without due process and didn't try to hold him accountable in any way whatsoever. Guess they don't really practice what they preach. Thanks for clarifying that, Hillary bootlicker."
What Trump did 
What did Trump do?
Didn't Trump remove the rule to publish drone strike deaths?
Did Obama drone strike an American citizen without due process?
"You really just can't stay away from this sub, putinpaystrump. Get banned on one account and you're already back to logging 18 hour days spewing your bullshit across the sub."
"Damn, you really don't want to answer the question. Last chance:"
Did Trump go to Congress for authorization or no?
It's farcical how deep their obsession with Obama goes and how far they will go to avoid acknowledging this fact.
"Damn, you really don't want to answer the question. Last chance:"
Did Obama go to Congress for authorization in Libya or no?
"You're 100% a putinpaystrump sock puppet. He's the only account I've seen on this sub play this stupid question game. The mentally ill are going to mentally ill. You really have nothing else in life going for you, do you?"
I'm a little unclear on how you can demand answers when you refuse to answer any yourself lol
I'm a little unclear on how you can demand answers when you refuse to answer any yourself lol
This is a trademark putinpaystrump exchange.
How obsessed are you with this sub? Do you really have nothing better to do with your life?
Figured. 
"For anyone reading, the answer is that Trump didn't go to Congress, which makes the title of this article false."
"In fact, the top posted comment shows the difference in how Republicans view foreign interference depending on who's in office. Democrats are virtually static. "
Velshstein is a good example of the phenomenon where facts don't matter and the cognitive dissonance that accompanies the total lack of consistency or principles.
"You're a good example of someone who is obsessed with posting on Reddit. You got perma'd by Alpha on your <a href=""/u/PutinPaysTrump"" rel=""nofollow"">u/PutinPaysTrump</a> account and now you're posting on this one ad nauseum. Typical."
"Notice how as soon as <a href=""/u/PutinPaysTrump"" rel=""nofollow"">u/PutinPaysTrump</a> got banned from <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a> the posting 20+ times a day stopped altogether and <a href=""/u/FlameChakram"" rel=""nofollow"">u/FlameChakram</a> picks up the pace around the same time. Interesting indeed."
Wonder how the mods feel about ban evading? I wouldn't expect them to do anything considering a desperate tankie like yourself will keep creating accounts but I certainly hope they hold this alt account of yours to the same standard.
"So we agree, it's wrong no matter who is doing it.  Including Trump."
Didn't Obama go to Congress for oversight on Syria and was rejected?
When did Trump go to Congress?
"This. Over and over. Obama went and asked like a good president, Congress says no then GOP congressional asshats try to blame Obama for being soft and not doing anything. And all the Trumptards bought it."
Yup. And we're <em>still</em> waiting for Trump to produce Obama's birth certificate
That's a creative rewrite of history.  The first request never saw a full vote because Assad agreed to turn over it's chemical weapons before it could.  The second one was never brought to a vote effectively giving Obama the green light to move forward with his plans which he did.  Where do you get your information?
So you're saying Obama didn't go to Congress?
"He ""went to Congress"" in the literal sense of proposing a vote on a comically unpopular military action, but not in the sense that he actually abided by the constitutional restraints on his powers. He <em>repeatedly</em> attacked countries and even overthrew governments (Libya) with no oversight or approval whatsoever."
"Claiming Obama was a good president because he ""went to Congress first"" is like claiming a burglar is a good citizen because he bought a soda and some snacks from the convenience store before burglarizing it."
I don’t get it from Alex Jones and Hannity like you. That’s what I know.
"He went to congress for authorization and congress didn't approve or reject it which was most likely the desired outcome Obama was looking for.  Even before he submitted it though, Kerry was adamant that it didn't matter what congress said. "
"<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/obama-strike-syria-congress-kerry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/obama-strike-syria-congress-kerry</a> "
"Syria crisis: Obama 'has the right' to strike regardless of vote, says Kerry "
"The US has evidence that sarin nerve gas was used in chemical attacks outside Damascus last month and could go ahead with military strikes against Bashar al-Assad's regime even without the backing of Congress, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has said."
He went to congress for authorization
Awesome. When did Trump go to Congress?
Crickets
"Did he go to Congress for authorization on Libya? Oh wait, he called it a kinetic action and then helped throw the Middle East into turmoil."
His games in Syria also prolonged that conflict by years and led to 100s of thousands of deaths.
So Trump didn't go to Congress?
Did Obama go to Congress for authorization on entering a war in Libya?
"I'm 100% convinced you're putinpaystrump's sock puppet. You had zero activity for months until he was banned, your posting histories are almost identical and you don't actually answer any questions like he did."
You keep licking those democrat boots.
"Wait, that guy's gone? Interesting."
"He got banned a week or so ago, right around the time flamechakram started posting here 18 hours a day (a putinpaystrump hallmark)."
Never mind that their posts read exactly the same.
....so Trump didn't go to Congress?

Stop username pinging me dude.
But since you've got me here:
Did Trump go to Congress for authorization on his strike in Iraq?
"They really, really do not want to answer that question."
"Oh, is there a reason I should stop username pinging you, putinpaystrump? Will you beat me up or something if I don't? "
"You've been following me around this sub for a week now, which lines up perfectly with your other moniker's banning. Can't imagine why you'd be upset that someone would call you out on your obsessive stalking habits. "
"Anyway, ban evasion is a bannable offense and it's pretty obvious you're a sock puppet of <a href=""/u/putinpaystrump"" rel=""nofollow"">u/putinpaystrump</a>, who was banned a week or so ago."
You haven't answered the question still
"I really don't see the point of the question. By all metrics, it was legal. That's a result of decades of abuses of power by both sides of the aisle. "
"Jeh Johnson, who was general counsel of the DoD from 2009-2012 and Obama's DHS secretary from 2013-2017 says it's legal. Do you honestly think you know better than him? Let's hear your argument against his then. "
"Agree or not with the drone strike, the legality question is incredibly stupid and typical of dipshits like yourself, <a href=""/u/putinpaystrump"" rel=""nofollow"">u/putinpaystrump</a>. "
"Also, if it was legal for Obama to drone strike an American citizen without due process, then I definitely don't see how one could even try to argue that drone striking the head of a designated terrorist organization is illegal. It just screams stupidity."
I really don't see the point of the question. 
Because you know the answer will make you look like a partisan hack.
Jeh Johnson is a Republican? The general counsel for the DoD from 2009-2012 and Obama's DHS secretary from 2013-2017? He provided justification for it being legal. You're coming off as a very stupid person here. 
"It's a stupid question and you're a dipshit. I know this is hard for you to grasp, <a href=""/u/putinpaystrump"">u/putinpaystrump</a>."
Donald Trump is a Republican and currently the President. 
I'll be answering your questions the second you answer the original question from my OP:
When did Trump go to Congress for his strike in Iraq?
"No, he didn't need to, as laid out by Jeh Johnson, a Democrat who led Obama's DHS for 4 years. I think he's probably a little more in tune with needing Congress's approval than an idiot like yourself. "
Care to explain to me how Obama drone striking an American citizen doesn't need congressional approval but Trump drone striking the head of a designated terrorist organization does? The concept is so fucking stupid it actually belies belief that you're arguing it.
No
Thanks for playing.
PPT was permabanned.
"And I'd lay money on flamechakram being his sock puppet. Identical posting styles, down to the same dipshit answering any question with a question and the account was inactive for months until PPT was banned."
The admins have been notified. It looks similar enough I felt like bringing it to them.
Being opposed to a blatantly unconstitutional assassination of a foreign general makes you a Dove now?
"Unfortunately that's always been true.  Dems hated the Middle East war when Bush was President and Repubs loved it.  Then when Obama got elected, suddenly Repubs hated it and Dems loved it.  Just two sides of the same coin."
"I really do wonder where people get this idea that democrats loved the war in the ME, every poll has shown more or less consistent opinion. Republicans have completely flopped. "
"Look at the ""red line"" in Syria, democrats before and after, around 35% support. Under Obama the GOP were around 30% for it, when Trump decided to attack, some 60% supported it. Democrats are still at 35%. "
The entire Obama thing was a controlled withdrawal of troops while not leaving allies behind that went in with us or that we developed over time. 
"But i'm willing to be proven wrong, can you find me any democrat that was for the ME war under Obama but not under Trump? You sure it isn't just different people? 30% still means there are around 15 Senators that support the war in the ME even if the majority of the party doesn't. I can find countless flips by the GOP."
"Raunchy is a Trump bootlicker, facts aren't really relevant"
It’s gotta be projection or a self-soothing method to account for their own hypocrisy—

"In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that only 22 percent of Republicans supported the U.S. launching missile strikes against Syria in response to Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons against civilians."
A new Post-ABC poll finds that 86 percent of Republicans support Donald Trump’s decision to launch strikes on Syria for the same reason. Only 11 percent are opposed.
"-- Overall, a bare 51 percent majority of U.S. adults support the president’s action in our new poll. In 2013, just 30 percent supported strikes. That swing is driven primarily by GOP partisans. For context, 37 percent of Democrats back Trump’s missile strikes. In 2013, 38 percent of Democrats supported Obama’s plan. That is well within the margin of error"
"They flip flop on issues all the time, and since they're unprincipled rubes, they think everyone else is like them."
The entire Obama thing was a controlled withdrawal of troops while not leaving allies behind that went in with us or that we developed over time.
Uh-huh.
"And drone striking Libya and Syria, plunging them into civil war and facilitating the rise of the Islamic State?"
Are you going to try and pretend Democrats didn't like that?  Because news flash: they all did.  They all loved Hillary for doing it so much that she used it in her 2016 election.
The blindness the Democrats have indoctrinated into you is honestly pretty astounding.
Because news flash: they all did. They all loved Hillary for doing it so much that she used it in her 2016 election.

Do I need to go on?  Or are you ready to admit you're a retard yet?
I don't see anything there about loving Hillary for her actions in Libya lol
You also weren't clear on who the 'they' was in your quote there
"It's literally the first link, retard.  Democrats were so positive about her actions in Syria she brought it up in a debate as a positive attribute for her."
Holy fuck you're illiterate.
Can you point out specifically which part of that article you're referring to?
It's literally the first fucking paragraph.
"Holy fuck, really?  Either you're actually this retarded, or you just think everyone else is.  I'll give you a little tip, buddy: just because you're a barely literate troglodyte with an IQ lower than your height in meters doesn't mean the rest of us are."
And I'm not going to walk you through words one by one to compensate for your mental deficiency.
"Ah, so you don't actually have any evidence. What a shame."
I was willing to take you seriously this time since you weren't calling people 'tankies' reflexively.
The first paragraph quoted
"This is the kind of compulsive misrepresentation that makes Clinton unfit to be President.  Clinton’s role in Syria has been to help instigate and prolong the Syrian bloodbath, not to bring it to a close."
Remember when Democrats hand waved away Obama killing an American citizen without due process? His bootlickers in this thread don't.
"I don't remember the GOP going out and protesting, or even talking about it. I do remember many news outlets (the fake news media) covering it though. "
"Can you point out any polling that shows that the GOP were really against it? Did the GOP even investigate it? It appears when he was killed, the GOP had control of oversight, but I can't seem them investigating it. So wouldn't the handwaving be by the GOP?"
"And right on cue, we have the whataboutism. I don't know why you people don't realize that this only shows your biases and lack of actual care towards these abuses of power. "
"If Democrats are so anti-War and constitutional rights, you think they would have done something about a guy killing an American citizen without due process. Hell, they've still yet to provide any evidence whatsoever. "
Posts like yours really show that you don't actually care about the abuses of power so much as you do at getting back the GOP. Same goes for the people who wave away Trump's actions.
"And right on cue, we have the whataboutism. "
"Yeah, from you - this thread isn't about Obama, it's about Trump.  But you don't talk about Trump, you only like trashing Obama, so you keep changing the subject"
"It's fucking pathetic, and you are pathetic"
Same goes for the people who wave away Trump's actions.
"You.  You are the person who does this, you never say shit about his actions"
"And right on cue, we have the whataboutism."
LOL
Irony is fucking dead.
"Care to provide justification for why Jeh Johnson is wrong and you're not? Or are you just going to keep following me around the sub, <a href=""/u/putinpaystrump"" rel=""nofollow"">u/putinpaystrump</a>?"
Care to provide justification for why your ass is getting beaten black and blue up and down this thread while you screech hysterically about Obama to the point where you beg for mods to ban the other person? lmao.
"You are claiming democrats did hand waving, when you present no evidence, and as you ignored my point, the GOP had oversight and didn't do anything about it. The GOP were the check on that power of Obama and they did nothing. "
"You are holding the democrats to higher standards than the GOP, and even in that context you aren't even proving that democrats supported it."
Democrats oppose war the same way Republicans oppose government spending.
"In 2006 the Democrats were in a position to defund the War in Iraq and instead of actually doing so they sat on their asses and pretended to be anti-war while letting Bush do whatever the fuck he wanted. They reliably passed acts like the NDAA and Patriot Act that drastically increased the president's powers to start and perpetuate wars even when they controlled both the House and Senate. They also didn't so much as utter a peep when Obama <a href=""https://www.salon.com/2016/09/16/u-k-parliament-report-details-how-natos-2011-war-in-libya-was-based-on-lies/"" rel=""nofollow"">invaded Libya under false pretenses to overthrow their government, bringing slavery back to the region and creating the refugee crisis</a>."
If Democrats were even 1/10th as anti-war as they claim there wouldn't have been a single American war of aggression after 2006. Yet hilariously they literally <em>just voted</em> to give Trump nearly unprecedented powers despite simultaneously claiming that he's an erratic Russian stooge that can't be trusted.
"Dems never loved the Middle East wars just because Obama was elected, that's a trash argument."
Dems loved it.
This is a fantasy
Obama carried out open acts of war against <em>12 counties</em> and Democrats cared so little that <em>you don't even remember it anymore.</em>
They act like we were born in 2016 and Google doesn't exist.
"I love these posts, I love the articles about how the sun gives you a sunburn too. Umm... eating too much makes you fat, drinking too much gets you drunk. So on."
"War is only bad if it's the ither side waging it and the constitution's importance depends on who is president, this is business as usual. It difficult to have a legitimate discussion with true anti war people on the right or left with out getting annoyed at all of these born again ""war is bad ""activists giving their opinion acting like they still have a spot at the adults table despite being MIA since 2008."
No shit.
"Here's some more spicy Mike Lee: 
""One of the messages that we received from the briefers was: Do not debate, do not discuss the issue of appropriateness of further military intervention against Iran. And that if you do you'll be emboldening Iran"""
"<a href=""https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1215025107313274882"">https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1215025107313274882</a>"
"That message is absolutely correct, political dysfunction at home weakens our hand overseas."
Publicly undermining the president's ability to respond to foreign attacks encourages more of them to take place.
War is Mass Murder. Trump can get fucked
"Two non sequiturs in eight words, impressive idiocy."
Sheep
You know that Congress could still declare war using the largest and most advanced standing military force that the Earth has ever seen right?
Fuck that noise they’re there to debate and find a better way
"That message is absolutely correct, political dysfunction at home weakens our hand overseas."
Just follow the government and do not debate. We need to support acts of war to strengthen our hand overseas where we shouldn’t even have our militaty in the first place. 
Why even have a congress let’s just go back to a monarchy.
Whether or not it weakens our hand depends upon whether or not there is a hand currently acting in our interests. The interests of residents are purely expressed only through a purely public government or republic. The primary foreign policy objective of republics is the disestablishment of monarchy. The second foreign policy objective of republics is the establishment of allied republics in which residents maintain direct and popular control of land and law.
"The people need to know that the ""hand overseas"" is primarily being used to forward the interest of Iraqi republicans and help the protestors there establish a safe and prosperous country free from oppression by the Iranian landed establishment, and that the ""hand overseas"" is not simply being used to promote the interests of the Saudi monarchy."
Oh look the two senators I think are alright!
Good. Glad to see there are still some anti-war Republicans left.
Does this mean that congress will finally have to take some responsibility?
"No, they'll find a way to still shirk it."
If Rand supports it then it probably isn’t passing anyway.
Why do you say that? Was there a libertarian bill that came close to passing that Rand Paul voted against?
Why do you say that?
Because Rand Paul is notorious for suddenly becoming vocally libertarian when it doesn't matter and licking Trump's lap when its more convenient for him.
"Dudes been defending trumps illegal actions for some time, votes largely with Trump, and never seems willing to go against Trump when it matters."
"In this case, Trump will veto it and that will end that."
Hasn’t voted for a budget. 
Receipts. What votes has he made to side with Trump he wouldn’t have made otherwise.
You’re talking purely about rhetoric on cable news channels.
Because Rand Paul is notorious for suddenly becoming vocally libertarian when it doesn't matter
"Ok, then that implies he isn't libertarian when it does ""matter."" So is there a vote that ""mattered"" where he voted against libertarian principles?"
votes largely with Trump
He and Susan Collins are the two Republicans that vote with Trump the least. 
never seems willing to go against Trump when it matters.
"I don't care what it seems like, I care about his actual actions and votes. So I ask again, is there a vote that ""mattered"" where he chose Trump over libertarian principles?"
So defending Trump actions like Ukraine is now libertarian to you?
Because Paul did that. And still is.
"I didn't say that. You keep saying that Rand Paul only votes libertarian when it doesn't matter. Yet you can't even provide one vote that ""mattered"" where he didn't vote how a libertarian would vote."
Are we to the point in the English language where we are using twitter handles in place of names?
"I'm all for limiting presidential war powers, the president should not have the authority to wage war without congress. With that said most of lefts actions on this were completely partisan, most have been MIA since 2008 when it comes to war protests."
"Ok, that's a fair point. Now, if given the opportunity to take war powers from the executive, would you decline because Democrats were arguing in bad faith?"
"I don't care the reasons they want to change the situation, I care that they currently do."
"No I wouldn't decline, i would support it, but Would do so while pointing out their hypocrisy."
Wish Rand Paul would stop compromising himself to have Trump’s ear.
"Honestly he was my favorite politician in Washington back in 2016, but it seems he keeps going with the party since trump was elected"
Where has he “compromised” himself?
"That could mean nearly anything, and they still need a quarter of Republican in the house and half or so in the Senate to sign on."
That could mean nearly anything
No it couldn't. They are referring to a specific plan that has already been introduced by Senator Tim Kaine.
Two is a good start though.
Maybe. Paul has to actually stop sucking Trumps dick long enough to remember he said this.
He takes turns with McConnell to send out these tweets
"FWIW McConnell straight forward. He is ""whatever helps Republicans win and hurts democrats"" and not much more.  He doesn't try to act like anything he isnt. "
Or I dont see him as anything beyond that.
"I expected this kind of treasonous behavior from Rand Paul, after all, he's the guy who launched a filibuster to stop terrorists from being droned, but it's a bit of a disappointment to see it from Mike Lee."
I guess he really wants to take on the John McCain role and go around TV bashing other Republicans to whatever liberal host will have him. Maybe he wants to get his daughter a job on The View?
How can consider yourself a libertarian when you criticize Rand Paul for taking an anti-war position? 
I guess he really wants to take on the John McCain role and go around TV bashing other Republicans to whatever liberal host will have him. Maybe he wants to get his daughter a job on The View?
"John McCain was a warhawk, may he burn in hell."
I don't understand why dogmatic isolationism is considered the only acceptable libertarian view of foreign policy.
"""Freedom for Americans, and fuck every everyone else"" is not the moral imperative you think it is."
Rand Paul (R)*
I had assumed the L meant he was the guy standing on the left in the video for people who didn't know which one was which.
I know he runs as a Republican. He can’t win as a libertarian so he is pragmatic.
I would of agreed with you several years ago but he only has libertarian leanings now
"With the way GOP voters are now, he couldn’t win if he didn’t get in line. The GOP walks in lock step or spits you out quick."
"Yea I get it, he caved on principles to stay in office. But as it stands, he no longer gets to be called a libertarian"
So he has no principles? Other than stay a politician for life and live off tax payers... Sad.
"I mean, he’s still one of the better ones but yea pretty much"
He’s as close to a libertarian senator as we will see in our lifetime.
"Maybe, maybe not. Maybe he should stand on principle, finish out his term and let someone else take a shot at his seat."
"Libertarians don't like Rand anymore because he praises trump too much. But he praises him when trump has been anti war, like when he wanted to get out of Syria for example. Now hes going against trump on Iran, Rand Paul plays politics but he sticks to his principles"
No. He is a Republican through and through
"No, he's a Republican."
Wait did Rand switch parties?
"No, he just runs as a Republican so he can hold office. Can’t win a senate seat as a libertarian."
"While Rand Paul has done things that most libertarians would strongly disagree with, he deserves credit for this. When many other ""anti-war"" Republicans sided with Trump on this issue, Mike Lee and Rand Paul actually took the opposite side of a president that is very popular in both of their home states. I'm glad to see them stand up against war and for the Constitution and peace."
"""If we're going to fight to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, this regime, then we need to rewrite the rules that are advantageous to us,"" "
"We've been afraid of Iran getting a nuclear bomb since the 1980s, every couple years or so we bring it back up, and say OH THEYRE JUST A FEW MORE YEARS AWAY, well, they still don't have it. They don't even have a fucking Airforce...
But the more important thing, why shouldn't they? What gives us the right to tell them they cannot?"
How long can we realistically expect to keep 1940s tech out of the hands of our enemies?
Keep bombing them into the stone age and we can expect it indefinitely.
But you have to be cool with massacring millions every decade or so. Which... kinda makes you sound like the bad guys.
"""Rights"" are usually a moral issue. But morality doesn't work so well as a warfare deterrent as big weapons do, as history has proven often. So it stands to common sense that ensuring those who are not aligned with you have next to zero power, regardless of what's fair or not. "
"This would actually fit into ignoring morality altogether. But unless you rule uncontested, the appearance of being fair remains crucial because some kind of moral assessment is part of any human being decision, and you don't want to undermine support."
"More to the point, threats to bomb non-military targets seems to forget why those rules and guidelines came into being in the first place. Any aggressive action always triggers some kind of reciprocity, and unlimited escalation is very destructive to both sides. "
"I think it is unnecessary to address the total lack of awareness in a suggestion such as ""we need to rewrite rules that are advantageous to us"" in something like this. But it scares me that such mindless arrogance can get so casual."
"But the more important thing, why shouldn't they?  "
Because dictatorships are not limited by the same checks and balances as western democracies.  That also includes 'Trumps America' as there are ways to prevent him from launching nuclear bombs on a whim even if he wanted to. 
What gives us the right to tell them they cannot? 
"In my opinion, nothing. They shouldn't be trusted with them but at the same time we ultimately have no right to tell them no so it's quite the conundrum we face in our effort to prevent nuclear winter."
"They do have an Air Force. It’s a couple decades old, but unfortunate we sold them the planes so their not terrible."
"You're right, murcia should just sell them nukes. Not like they'd be used against them or anything."
I mean you can just buy nukes on the black market
Vice literally did it 10 or so years ago
Really? How to do you ship a nuke? 
This has to be old vice.
"Yeah it was old vice, it's pretty easy to ship a nuke TBH. They're not very radioactive and not very large (can fit tons in a truck)"
These fucking twats know nothing of war or the waste it is. Put these cunts on the front lines to let them see what exactly they’re supporting.
"Say what you want about people from another time, but Churchill supported a lot of wars.  But he was never hesitant to send himself to the front.  After he took the fall in cabinet for Gallipoli (and he deserved a good amount of the blame) he joined the Grenadier Guards on the Western Front where he spent the next year.   "
"Does any one here think any one in the current cabinet would  willingly place themselves in the Iraqi Green zone without added security for more than a day?  And bare in mind, the Green zone is already the most secure place in Iraq without any extra  security....   Imagine Trump willingly deciding to have himself live there for a year on his own without bending over laughing hysterically at the stupidity that it could happen in anything other than an SNL skit. "
Trump and everyone in his cabinet are traitorous cowards.
These fucking twats know nothing of war or the waste it is.  Put these cunts on the front lines to let them see what exactly they’re supporting. 
I mean I get your sentiment and would normally agree but the 'twat' you're referring to is a former decorated army officer who <em>volunteered</em> to serve in Iraq on the front lines.  You couldn't have directed this comment at a less applicable person.
More so referring to the Fox propaganda pushers or anyone who calls for war but hasn’t been. So easy for them to do. Also even if he’s a decorated Army officer doesn’t give him a pass for something that isn’t right.
He’ll end up in front of a war crimes committee at the UN once he’s out of office if he does.
"Nice idea, but hopelessly naïve. No American war criminal has ever been tried in such a fashion because we’re already the enforcement arm of the UN and there’s literally nothing the UN can do without our cooperation."
Yeah but I said once out of office. You don’t think the dems will throw him to the wolves once they get control?
It would be unprecedented.
Btw happy cake day!
I know several Trump supporters that were vocal about how the Taliban was destroying Buddhist monuments years ago in Afghanistan. Now I guess something has changed about that kind of thing...
The rest of Fox News has been shockingly good on this though. They have denounced his actions.
"BusinessInsider told me that somebody at fox news has the presidents ear, and that person supposedly told Trump to rewrite the rules of war."
Hegseth appeared to encourage Trump to undermine international law and target Iranian cultural sites <strong>if they're being used to store weapons</strong>. 
Key words. Why are they important?  Because 'militarily necessary' bombing of cultural sites doesn't violate international law.  Both the Geneva and Gauge conventions allow military necessity exemptions. If Trump could prove they're hiding weapons at these sites then he could theoretically bomb them without breaking any international agreements.  That's why the author uses 'undermine' instead of 'violate' because he can give the impression that Trump is being encouraged to violate international law without technically saying it.
"<a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2020/jan/06/if-donald-trump-orders-bombing-iranian-cultural-si/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2020/jan/06/if-donald-trump-orders-bombing-iranian-cultural-si/</a> "
I'm tired of having to sound like I'm defending military action in the middle East just to debunk misleading news articles posted by the same half dozen people day in and day out on here.  I'm very much an isolationist that loathes our image as 'world police' but this constant misleading reporting is out of hand.
From the Ministry of Truth itself.
But Pence is a good Christian and would never lie!!!!
Thou shall not kill unless Muslim
"is there any evidence that pence is a living, breathing, human and not a sim?"
Mother says he is a human.
Listen and believe like the redcaps do. /s
"Yeah, that would be Saudi Arabia who was the Govt behind 9/11. Not Iran. You know, Saudi Arabia? The country that Trump gave nuclear secrets to? Without getting authorization from anyone. No checks, no balances, just do whatever in the fuck he wants to because his supporters allow it. Actually, they love it when he does it."
"Remember when it was uncovered that the Saudis funded 9/11 and it wasn't talked about at all, that's how I know it's true"
"No offense, but PolitiFact and Snopes are less believable than the CIA."
"You know - the nice thing is no one has to just blindly accept their opinion. The value is that they source what information they are using so you can make a judgement yourself. So, is there something in their sourcing that you specifically disagree with or are you just blindly being contrarian for....some reason."
So how is Politifact wrong about this then?
So he didn't tweet that?
Should I link his twitter?
"While that may be true, nothing about what is said is false."
Feel free to prove them wrong and cite some evidence of Pence's claims.
Half this sub is the opposite of libertarian.
Half this sub is Trump supporters who are perpetually confused that libertarians aren't Republicans.
"When are Libertarians going to realize that it's not just Trump, it's the entire GOP? They pay lip service to <em>some</em> Libertarian-ish ideas on the campaign trail, but that goes out the window when they get that sweet powah."
"we will never have a libertarian controlled government, nobody is going to vote to have less power for themselves, best thing you can do is vote libertarian in your local and state elections"
Yes. Man!
Libertarian ideals break down in the aggregate... yet are so fundamentally essential!
I've been a mostly downticket Libertarian voter for over a decade now. People tell me I'm wasting my vote (both sides claim it helps the other 🤔) but a vote made is not a vote wasted imo.
"the real libertarian thing to do is vote for a president that is different to who holds the majority in congress , ensuring that the government gets nothing done"
That won't even work. We need to change the voting system so that voters have the confidence that they can vote for their favorite party/candidate. First past the post voting (and gerrymandering) is the true problem.
"<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/</a>"
"Seems to me almost everyone does that, on both sides, even some of the grassrootsier. Rubio, Obama...."
Well you work with the options you have right? Neither party is close to libertarian but Democratic candidates want to massively expand the size of government while Republicans still want to expand it but not as much.
I’m not even sure that’s objectively true anymore. Defense spending outstrips social spending.
"Evil, even if lesser, is still evil nonetheless."
"Trump supporters and the_donald immigrant's main purpose here is to make sure Libertarians do NOT vote Libertarian, no matter  what!"
"When someone tells me I'm wasting my vote, I like to thank them for letting me know, ask them who they're voting and tell them I'm voting for the opposite party they support."
Voting is important... ONLY if you vote for my candidate though 😏
Everytime someone tries to get me to vote for a political candidate I want to vote for the other person strictly to cancel out their vote
"I mean, that’s your right. Isn’t that a great opportunity to open a dialogue with them about different views though? Quietly voting against them for spite seems petty. Maybe I misunderstand you."
The remaining are at least 30% progressive liberals who think that they are libertarian.
Or anarcho coms keeping a eye on the backup plan
"One of my college roommates would register the opposite party of their (his whole family did this) beliefs, just so they could vote in the primaries... for the candidate(s) they thought would give THEIR party the best chance of winning. "
"Ya, fun times on nights we all drank together... 4 of us, a leftist, a rightist, and two centrists, but leaning different ways. Actually really was good times!"
That moment when you end up effectively virtue signaling and end up hurting the things you want like 2nd amendment rights
Their purpose here is they feel entitled to other people's opinions.
Yes. Yes I do. I feel entitled to read other people's opinions and change my mind based on what they have to say.
Indeed.
That's because Libertarians are what Republicans claim to be while actually doing the opposite.
"Where on this sub is this T_D lite I can never find?  A thread shitting on Trump gets highly upvoted with all the comments shitting on Trump and people who like him.  Like this thread, where are the pro-Trump top comments?  The thread has 87% upvote ratio too.  If half the sub is pro Trump how does it not show up at all? "
"But, if you say libertarian socialists aren't real libertarians watch how many pour out of the wood work to correct me."
Libertarian socialists?????
"""Libertarian socialist"" basically means anarchist. The term came from spain a long time ago when spain was against free speech and banned anarchist speech. The anarchists responded by posting newspaper articles as ""libertarian socialists."" Its basically someone who thinks business ownership is bad because they dont understand basic economics"
Or conservatives that think libertarians have a point on most things
"This is a “no true Scotsman” situation. If you asked every American who self-identifies as libertarian and asked them who they voted for, what % do you think it would be?"
"Libertarian is the biggest third party, so it's the first choice for a lot of people to latch onto when they get sick of establishment politicians from either side. It's not far-fetched to say that many of those aren't ""real libertarians"" considering they choose the label to be contrarian. Other than the TD people that believe Trump is libertarian, there's not actually a lot of those kinds of people in this subreddit (from what I've experienced)."
And the other half are a bunch of larping socialists.
The other half is communists just coming in to trash the discussion.
Democratic socialist here just want to hear what y'all have to say and hate Trump in solidarity.
"Isnt that the perpetual state of libertarian circles? I had to ditch a few ""libertarian"" friends but still hang out on this sub because of that confusion. "
"Well...mostly it was one was a crystal healer and the other claimed to be psychic and it was driving me nuts, but also partly they were confused trumpians."
"The only libertarian friends I ditch are the, ""fuck you I got mine"" type. I think they just left the GOP because they're atheists and couldn't deal with the cult anymore."
Well...mostly it was one was a crystal healer and the other claimed to be psychic
were they women?  Because every libertarian woman I have ever met has been batshit insane
"They were a married couple. I was wondering why they'd get so mad when I jokingly called them ""hippies"" (dude, they burned sage in the house to get rid of demons....a little self awareness please?). Turns out they took that as ""liberal"" and as a slur. But that's neither here nor there.  "
"I may as well say it had nothing to do with politics. They were the type of people that were so bought into many different ideologies in all the wrong, culty ways. At some point I couldn't keep my mouth shut about astrology and veganism and continue to be nice. Live and let live...at a distance."
Half this sub are leftist who are perpetually confused that Libertarians aren't socialists.
"And the other half are commies who think they are ""left-wing libertarians""."
Honestly theres like at most 10% libertarians here.
"So true, but in the libertarian way- we don’t ban them because just because we disagree with them"
Half this sub can’t decide what real libertarianism is...
But it's the only place they have left.
"<a href=""/r/goldandblack"">/r/goldandblack</a> and <a href=""/r/shitstatistssay"">/r/shitstatistssay</a> would like a word"
Aren't those also libertarian subs?
"They can march around with torches yelling ""Jews will not replace us"" again."
It’s commies in disguise
There are too many bootlickers from TD

Opposite of a libertarian?
"Hmm, let me just get out the ol' political compass and see what the opposite of a libertarian is..."
"Oh shit, Trump is an authoritarian.  Well how about that!"
"Nah, we cannot trust this source. Libertarian party is a well known agent of the far left /s"
Did you hear Gary Johnson supports an age of consent?
That fucking leftist pedophile. You call that freedom? I call that communism
An age of consent is alright as long as it's privatized
each person sets their own age of consent
Why don't you take a seat over there?
hey i set my age of consent to... what is the age of ephebophilia agin? idk 14? anyways <em>snort</em> yeah thats technically not pdeophilia!!! thats what the cool kids are doing these days right
I'm not going to contribute an opinion on this radioactive topic.  
""" They're too young to bleed, they're too young for weed, no grass on the field no grass will they yield."" But a quote from <a href=""https://www.tv-quotes.com/shows/weeds/quote_13082.html"" rel=""nofollow"">weeds</a> did pop into my head."
When does the individual reach a cognitive age where they understand what consenting to sex is?
"if you want to get technical, the concept of permission and the concept of sex can be understood quite early."
"my comment was jest and im for 16+ age of consent, and i also want better sex ed so kids who do decide to have sex know what theyre getting in to."
According to its fair market value.
With this fucking subreddit I don't know who in this thread is being sarcastic or not.
"Yup, lol. "
"I was being sarcastic, but in the flavor of the sub."
"I think a ""/s"" would be helpful here..."
"We do value maximum individual freedom and personal responsibility, which is anathema to Republicans and Trumpettes. So yeah, we're leftists to those authoritarians."
I mean some of us are
"<a href=""https://i.giphy.com/media/iQ44hm6doqZLq/200w.webp"">Well how about that!</a>"
I can no longer read those words and <em>not</em> imagine Tim Curry in Drag.
That is the correct response.
Time to change my flair...
The opposite of a libertarian is a nairatrebil.
"Well, that’s nothing new."
Everyone with a  brain:
Duh.
So we still need to get through to the flat Earth wing of the libertarian party
Now this is investigative journalism
Don't libertarians say that about literally anybody who isn't libertarian? And even those who are libertarian?
"the ""no true libertarian"""
To be fair there is definitely a spectrum of libertarian ideals.
"Yeah, the huge difference in ideology between left and right libertarians produces a lot of infighting. We are a contentious bunch, but at least we can all agree authoritarianism is bullshit right?"
Brothers and sisters are natural enemies! Like Libertarians and Communists! Or Libertarians and Fascists! Or Libertarians and other Libertarians! Damn Libertarians! They ruined Libertarianism!
You libertarians sure are a contentious bunch
YOU JUST MADE AN ENEMY FOR LIFE!
"Left libertarians: ""Stay away from my weed!"" "
"Right libertarians: ""Stay away from my guns!"""
"""Socially liberal, economically conservative libertarians"": ""Stay away from my weed and my guns!"" "
"Crazy libertarians: ""If I want to drive drunk I am going to do as I damn well <em>please</em>!"""
"Crazy libertarians: ""If I want to drive drunk I am going to do as I damn well please!"""
"Also, ""Seatbelts are government tyranny!"""
Driver’s Licenses are literally indistinguishable from rape-murder-theft-slavery.
"There's a difference between ""not"", and ""opposite."" Trump is embodiment of some of the worse aspects of the top left and top right of the modern political chart."
Trump like power. I don't think he has any actual goal beyond looking powerful.
"What's one ""left"" thing he's done?"
"Well yeah, because basically any other party wants more government and regulation in certain forms. But Trump is specifically authoritarian which imo is even further from libertarianism than the democratic left or right."
"You're just trying to muddy the waters further. 
trump is an authoritarian in his speech and his actions and his planned actions.  I'm sick of people in this sub trying water those facts down."
"No, we don't."
Was there ever any doubt?
Spend enough time here and you’ll find hordes of commenters arguing that Trump is somehow “the most libertarian president ever.”
It’s a good thing that Reddit doesn’t reflect any of what’s really going on.
This isn’t true. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that argument. There’s <em>a lot</em> of Trump bashing around here. I don’t know what sub you’re reading though.
"I spend quite a bit of time here, I haven't run across these hordes. "
"One could argue that of the presidents the last few decades Trump is more libertarian, if that makes any sense to the philosophy. "
I think the argument should be if one supports realpolitik as a tactic Trump is the best choice currently.
"I've seen comments and posts from people who are a little too supportive of Trump, but there really aren't that many of them -- certainly not a horde."
"I've seen more Bernie and Yang shills, not to mention people who seem to think the only point of this sub is to yell at Trump and act like his authoritarian tendencies are somehow different and far worse than those of Obama and Bush."
"If we are playing ""lesser of two evils"" (much as I hate it), I'd take Trump over any of the Dem candidates.  On the flipside, arguing that a Dem winning POTUS will make the Republicans vote more consistently in our favor is also reasonable, if riskier."
"I mean, he banned bump stocks. That was one of the things he did that pissed me off."
I didn't even want one until I couldn't get one.
Correct
Sad that it even needs to be said...
Does it though? I mean who actually thought he was a libertarian?
"Lots of people on this sub, unfortunately."
Lots of shits.
Many T_D users have made an effort to get in here and sway the tone/message of the libertarian party.
That may be true but I think that a lot of conservative types genuinely think that they're libertarian or heavily libertarian-leaning.  The reality is that their overlap is usually confined to one or two issues (2A &amp; government spending).
"To be fair, I've met a fair share of rural (central California foothills) conservatives who DO lean quite a bit more libertarian."
"My friend and family are libertarian and I think for many political ideologies, Trump was whatever you wanted him to be.  Nevermind he's a rich authoritative millionaire with bad morality, he could seem to anyone voting for him to be the anti-politician."
"It was true in 2015, when he espoused his idiotic ideas about the wall.  It was true in 2016 in the run up to the election, when he acted like a petulant child every single debate, presidential and RNC.  It’s been ridiculously obvious for over three years now.  But again, politicians are making bank off him, so nothing changes."
"But I kept being told that him being a petulant child and incompetent would DISMANTLE the state. And how many people commented: ""i would rather have the incompetent Trump in office than competent Hillary"""
"Libertarians are so focused on ""government bad"" that it makes it easy to manipulate them."
"Just like another talking point of ""Gridlock is great because nothing gets done"". Nothing useful to us gets done. Both parties will still come together to expand the military and fuck us over."
Unless you're in the lp in which case he is not the opposite. Both want to impose their views and rule you.
Finally. This sub can return to libertarianism
if i need my trumpbash fix i will visit worldnews and politics
"Libertarian Party: ""Gary Johnson and Bill Weld are the embodiment of a Libertarian"" lol"
"Ofcourse more many times more Libertarian than the authoritarian sitting in the office. ""Embodiment of Libertarianism"" is a stupid concept which will never ever satisfy every Libertarian. But scales can be set."
"The majority of delegates at a national convention selected them, for a variety of reason, some philosophical, some pragmatic, to run for an office they had no reasonable chance of winning. It's not like they were cardinals choosing a pope."
It's not like they were cardinals choosing a pope.
That's much more political.
"Yeah, I realized the weakness of the analogy practically as I was writing it."
Bill Weld was at least somewhat realistic.
This is obvious
"At some point a SMART Libertarian realizes the only issue Republicans agree with them on is ""guns rights.""  Seeing as that right is ""in the bag,"" one is left wondering why a REAL libertarian would ever vote for the Republicans, which they do with 99% consistency."
​
"……""smaller government?""  Yeah, demonstrate where Republicans actually favor less government;"
​
"But yeah, keep freaking out that somehow the conservative stacked supreme court will ever allow your guns to be taken and make that your sole priority in deciding who should run the country....but you have to stop complaining about EVER other issue you keep voting Republican candidate into office for; they promise you they are warhawks, they promise you they will take away your body autonomy (oh yeah, most of you 'forget' your libertarian 'values' when it comes to abortion), they promise you they will constantly stick their nose into your life over what you put into your body, whom you put your body into (or let into yours), they promise you they are going to let corporations you have no ""free market control"" of to put whatever the fuck they want into your body."
​
"No, really, keep being smarter than us libtard sheeple, YOU are making wise democratic choices.  You GET it."
"Less regulations are generally good (and admittedly, a lot of Trump's deregulation has been good for the economy). Nobody's advocating for no regulations. The ""free market"" is going to fix that in a ""libertarian utopia"" because a ""libertarian utopia"" would still have laws about pollution, waste, and poisoning people. "
"Why don't you examine tax policies? Like the 2018 tax cuts that cut taxes for far more people than the ""uber rich""? Which also helped to stimulate the economy as they said it would? You're right, nobody will stop stealing, but at least through tax cuts they're stealing less. "
"A conservative supreme court is the best outcome in that field. A majority of democratic frontrunners support banning/confiscating guns and further restricting gun rights, so yes, on that topic there are those that are <em>trying</em> to take guns away, and there's nothing wrong in supporting candidates that don't want to violate the constitution regardless of how successful they'll be. "
"Bodily autonomy in regards to abortion is a split issue. If you believe unborn children are humans that deserve a right to life and bodily autonomy, it's not so clear cut. If you choose to ignore that viewpoint completely, then sure, it may seem hypocritical for those that disagree, but only because you're willfully being ignorant. "
"And again, corporations can't put ""whatever the fuck"" they want into your body. Nobody can put anything in your body. You have the authority of what goes into your body. Putting straight up poison is illegal, and regardless, you should have some level of responsibility for what you choose to put into your body. Also, I'm pretty sure the government has ""poisoned"" people as well, and unlike what you people like to say about corporations, government actually makes laws, so where the fuck do you get off implying libertarians allow corporations to run wild with our lives as if they're the only ones capable?"
"You don't understand libertarians, and you don't understand Republicans, and you don't understand why one would vote for the other. There's plenty of reasons to also vote NOT Republican, but nothing you've posted here is that. And, at the very least, they are probably smarter than ""libtard sheeple"", which is I'm sure a low bar."
How is this being upvoted?  Your interpretations are just insane? How is corporate greed putting poison in my body?
"Anyone else, a serious libertarian, think this sub has gone to shit?"
"No force, whether it be the state or private enterprise, has the right to fuck with my well being or the well being of others. That's libertarianism."
So who's LITERALLY putting poisons in your body?
Are these 'trump is not a libertarian' threads going to be a daily occurrence now?  We fucking know.
A lot of people here seem to be unaware.
"I don’t know, man. There are a lot of responses here defending him as “more libertarian than the last two presidents”, “libertarian on [insert exact topic here]” and other bullshit. There seem to be a lot of people here who seem to think he is the most libertarian choice and I think that until they realize that he isn’t libertarian in the least, we’ll continue to see these as a logical response."
"Yes, have you met the stupid fucks with tds that post here regularly. They think Republicans and libertarians are similar."
"Tbh with how many chapotards and TD idiots in this sub, and with how little actual libertarians care, it's not surprising that nobody on this site can figure out what is and isn't libertarian."
I'm sure there are at least 3 a week. 
"Not to mention the power-tripping mod that posted this feels it necessary to sticky (un-reply-able) comments at the top of popular posts: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/eknpul/ricky_gervais_says_jeffrey_epstein_didnt_kill/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/eknpul/ricky_gervais_says_jeffrey_epstein_didnt_kill/</a>"
I thought Libertarians didn't need to be babysat?
Someone's triggered
I think the left and the right are opposite of libertarianism.
"The right just wants smaller local government to tell you what to do, and make money while doing it. Then, the left just wants federal government to tell you what to do, and make money through various government programs."
Both parties are pro government and not pro independence.
"That's only if you think that the ""right"" and ""left"" are the Republican and Democratic parties and not ideologies in general. "
"Ideologically, you can be left or right and be a libertarian. It's a two-dimensional political spectrum. That's why anarcho-capitalism and mutualism exist and are still considered libertarian ideologies despite being on the right and left respectively."
"You know, I didn’t think about the ideological aspects, and was strictly looking at it from a Republican/Democrat party perspective. "
Your point is a good reminder for future discussion. Thank you for pointing that out.
Leftish libertarianish here!
And I'm a voluntaryist.
"Some people would tell you that left-libertarianism doesn't exist. I've seen it multiple times in this subreddit, where people are so hung up on partisan politics that they see political parties or current/prior states as the only representations of political ideologies. Individuals have different values and a state or political party might not represent that."
"That's the very reason why I defend both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists alike. Whether you're a collectivist or individualist, if you think that coercion shouldn't be used to enforce your system or ideologies then you're a libertarian. "
The fact of the matter is that libertarianism and authoritarianism are simply two ends of a sliding scale that indicates the willingness to use coercion by an individual or entity. Your values outside of that dictate where you stand otherwise.
"Most people define left as egalitarian and cooperative. The right is defined as believing in a competitive and hierarchical society bound to tradition. American Libertarians, even though I can't be conclusive, want a more cooperative government while still adhering to a competitive and hierarchical society, since individual liberty is the upmost priority. Thus is why libertarians are not really on the right and left spectrum, as one's personal ideals can be heavily weighted in either direction."
"I mean all of the Democrats, Trump, and Bloomberg are all opposite of Libertarian. This isn’t news."
Being opposite doesn't mean all fall on the same scale. Sanders isn't the same as Biden or AOC isn't supported he same as Cruz. Despite them not being Libertarians.
Important point.
What now redcaps?
I don't think trump ever claimed to be a liberatarian.
"Hell, he was a Democrat until recently."
I don't think trump ever claimed to be a liberatarian.
"He hasn't, his supports will still claim he is ""ThE mOsT lIbUrTaRiAn EvUh"""
I have never heard any Trump supporter make this claim.
Must be nice. Unfortunately I have.
Me either
Is it really worth replying to someone who comments like this:  ThE mOsT lIbUrTaRiAn EvUh
Yes
"You haven't been paying attention, then.  I see it here all the time"
What now redcaps?
You mean hes not libertarian!?😱
Damn! Maybe think about going with those Democrats. I hear they are for limited government these days😂
I hear they are for limited government these days
Comparatively speaking they sure do.
"Of course that's an indictment of republicans, not a positive revelation about democrats"
That's highly debatable.  Most issues involving economics they are not.
Crony capitalism is neither free market nor Libertarian.
Republicans are crony capitalists.
obviously.
"funny how this sub attracts all the_donald trolls like crazy though, who are not bright enough to understand that."
So many the_donald trolls that these threads top the front page on a daily basis.
I agree
"No shit, there aren’t a lot of people in or seeking office who are libertarian"
"Hell yes I am tired of trump fascists here pretending their mexican camps, and kim jung un love afair, and constiutional gang rape sessions are somehow making people more free."
Every president for the past 100 years has been the opposite of a libertarian. Why is this news to anyone?
"According to libertarians, everybody is the opposite of a libertarian if you look long enough."
The only real libertarian is the libertarian you're talking to. Just ask them.
Thanks for posting OP. I hope it gets more love then the usual posts from the LP. 
I am sure we will get lots of comments saying the LP is not libertarian enough. Hahah.
"Wow so Unexpected, How could someone ever know this before wow."
"the_donald: buh he did these 3 things that Libertarians like! See...he is more Libertarian than ""anyone that runs against him, ever""...so vote trump, not Libertarian!"
Why does this keep being a talking point in this sub!? If you even halfway consider Trump a libertarian you can just flock right out of here!
I lost respect for the libertarian party when a candidate for chairman stripped on stage.
I'll take the libertarian party seriously when their candidates are serious.
You will get scammed no matter which right wing libertarian you vote for.
Vote for real libertarians.
Water is wet
Yea I liked him at first but only because I was more terrified of Hillary I vote vermin supreme!!!
people with two brain cells to rub together: duh
I sincerely hope the 2020 nominee can give the dems and reps the hate they deserve. This is a political atmosphere  where you cant afford to appear to agree with anyone. We need a highly intelligent candidate who is fast on thier feet and well versed in national politics not local. We need a candidate  with a likable name.
Neo-Cons still ruining this country. Trump isn't the problem. He is a symptom of a wider and less visible problem.
We're just finding this out?
Trump is not opposite. And he is not conservative or liberal. He did not move towards GOP. The GOP moved to him. His ideology is himself. He would crown himself king if given the opportunity.
"Try telling his supporters that, they don't even know what libertarianism is. But they'll say they're more libertarian, but still Republican. I Always laugh when I hear Republicans talk about how they are fiscally conservative or libertarian. When you bring up stances on issues you find those titles don't match up to their beliefs"
Theres a right wing con that too many Libs have bought into. They tricked many to equating capitalism with aristocracy. 
"Never forget, the tyranny the original Libs fought against wasn’t communism or  fascism. It was aristocracy. Capitalism doesn’t exist where you don’t get to choose your vendor and products."
Why on earth did the libertarian party chose for a clown like Johnson ?
"Because all of the other people running for the nomination were even bigger clowns, or not serious about working in politics."
"There were a lot of problems with Johnson as a candidate. Believe me, I <em>hated</em> watching how immaturely his campaign was run. But he had been elected governor of New Mexico twice, and he was more libertarian than almost any mainstream politician by a <em>long shot.</em> The guy had some political clout and an actual track record. Given the options, I don’t think he was a terrible choice, and I think he’d have made a half-decent president. And in the end, he secured the largest share of the vote that a Libertarian candidate has ever won. Compared to the alternatives vying for the nomination, I don’t think anyone would have done as well as he did. The real problem, in my opinion, was less Johnson and more Weld, who couldn’t shut up about how much he respected Hillary Clinton."
Bingo. Johnson was a calculated choice that did pay off in some ways(Gained minor party status in my state).

"They're here, right on schedule"
As a libertarian I don't fucking care. He is there to battle deep state and offend the left that want to put restriction on speech.
"He said he would abide by the constitution. He took an oath. He banned bump stocks which is a violation of the constitution, weed is federally illegal which is also a violation."
"Trump's decision to assassinate a foreign leader has now embroiled us in YET ANOTHER mideast war.  What a goddamn fool that man and his supporters are, just, pure fucking idiots"
Neither is Bernie Fucking Sanders. I'm so sick of seeing that here too.
"Exactly correct, and plainly obvious that it is so."
"Well, the opposite is a fascist communist. Trump is not the opposite, but he is not close in any way either."
"Trump has been far more isolationist, even in the ME after this recent attack, than the past 5 presidents. No contention. You guys cannot separate emotion from facts."
"Trump has been far more isolationist, even in the ME after this recent attack, than the past 5 presidents"
yes I guess that's why he's been bombing all those countries Obama expanded his drone program to. Because of how isolationist he is.
"He’s got some libertarian positions, but mostly not. Just like Obama, and Bush, and Clinton, and Bush, and Reagan..."
"From the U.S. vantage point, what is a “democracy”? In today’s Orwellian vocabulary, it means any country supporting U.S. foreign policy. ... The antonym to “democracy” is “terrorist."

Might as well rely on palm reading to make economic predictions.
"I just wrote a post questioning who was the destabilizing force in the Middle East. I ask that question because the amount of hypocrisy oozing from the leaders of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US is just too much for me to take. As I know that this is all a bunch of bullshit propaganda aimed at starting a war in the ME for economic reasons, nothing more."
"While most people do not want to think the US Govt knew anything about the involvement of Saudi Arabia in 9/11, PRIOR to the attacks, this article is a major reason why that would be true. We know Saudi Arabia was involved in every aspect from the unclassified pages of the 9/11 Comm Report. There should be no question there. Where people question our own involvement is where it gets extremely problematic as I think most people just want to be in denial about it. "
"There is one person who I believe with regards to our involvement though, Indira Singh. She wasn't looking for involvement at all. She was just working her job on Wall St in Risk Management when she found herself in the middle of a conspiracy. It sounds insane even talking about it but she has court worthy documentation on the money trail and had no reason at all to go down this rabbit hole. "

"Iran's attack yesterday was a ""Face saving move"".  I don't think neither the U.S. or Iran want a full fledged war. I predict this situation will deescalate."
I hope for deescalation but won’t predict it. Trump’s response is more economic warfare and he is still surrounded by the same neocons that presented him with the assassination option and desire war with Iran.
"He's surrounded by neocons but war a full fledged war with Iran isn't really militarily or politically feasible. This is a poll from last summer but almost 80% of the population opposes war with Iran, it's only a few really low IQ conservative boomers that want it. "

Neocons want Trump gone. I believe they will stage a false flag or some other excuse to go to full scale war with Iran to hurt Trump's chances of releection.
I’ve got bad news.  Trump is a low IQ conservative boomer.
Trump isn't conservative dumbo.
True.  But he is “conservative” in the same sense that any republican politician is “conservative”.  Words lose or change their meaning when misapplied for so long.
He’s a neocon which is worse.
He's what a moderate liberal was during the Clinton years lol.
That's a fascinating parallel timeline.
Except for abortion I don’t see much inaccuracy in that.
Trump has been the most peaceful U.S. president since... Jimmy Carter? But he doesn't project weakness like Carter did.
How has he been more peaceful?  He bombs more civilians a year than Obama did.  Not AS hawkish as the Bush presidencies?  Maybe?  Depending on your metrics.
No he doesn't ya weasley lil loar.
"I think I’ll trust airforce reports (where the numbers would be reported too low if anything) before I trust a random delusional partisan on reddit, thanks."
What numbers are you going off of? # of drone strikes?
Total number of explosive thingies shot at or dropped on people.

"That's a weasley way of saying he's dropping more bombs on civilians when civilian deaths by US keep decreasing year over year, ya loar."
Provide me with literally any evidence that would lead one to believe that the civilian death count per year has gone down somehow with significantly increased bombing.  
"It might be hard, seeing as how trump took steps to keep that information secret since even he knows it makes him look bad."

The man has no credibility
I wonder if we'll ever truly know why Trump ordered the assassination?  Was there actionable intel?  Somehow I doubt it.
If assassinating Soleimani at all costs was a priority there were opportunities to do so before. The embassy attacks were just an useful pretext.
"Eventually, yes. They have to declassify information eventually."
No they don't. There's yet to provide any evidence supporting the claims for why Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011. Why would this be different?
It's only 2020. The default 'declassification date' is 10 years. 25 years sparks an automatic review with very few exemptions allowing information to remain classified after this time.
I meant more so in a time period where it would be relevant as Trump will be long gone but that's a good tidbit.
I doubt he honesty thinks for himself. Someone probably sold him on the idea and he rolled with it.
"He was already on an American hit-list, Iran had been ramping up their aggression and provocations and the embassy attack, in conjunction with Soleimani's arrival in the area, seemed to be the last straw. According to the administration there was enough available evidence to tie him to the event and suggest he'd play a hand in further anti-American violence. The assassination did two things: 1. establish that Iran did in fact have a presence and role in fomenting an uprising in Iraq (they were previously denying it) 2. establish that the US wasn't afraid to strike hard when provoked, or take a preemptive approach to defense."
Work that logic out. How did the assassination establish this?
It was a response to on the attack on U.S. base in Kirkuk on December 27th and then the attack the embassy on December 31st. Not to mention the U.S. didn't respond to Iran shooting down a U.S. drone or attacking oil tankers over the summer.  However all this was precipitated by Trump pulling out of the Iran deal and imposing sanctions.
That's not at all what the official stance is.
So everyone claiming WW3 was starting was wrong?
Yep.
Link to some people claiming WW3 was starting please. Thanks in advance.
I would be pleasantly surprised if Trump didn't strike back.
Tarrifs always are
Did someone claim they wouldn't be?

"Hello I have some personal testimony for this. My father operates a construction company in Maryland building resteraunt a and bars and such. Recently he has been getting a ton of business and so he is constantly buying supplies, mainly from Home Depot. One specific example I can think of is the wood supplies he buys for building. A regular 2X4 at Home Depot used to cost around $12 (at least where I am) but about after two years of temps tariffs on China the price has gone up to $24. side note: for people who don’t know south east Asia and China are huge exporters of building materials like wood and wall paper. Anyway this increase in price has eaten into my fathers profit margin, meaning my family and I don’t have as much money to spend at stores and local businesses resulting in less money circulating in our community. A real lose-lose if you ask me. Anyway just wanted to share, thanks!"
What the hell kind of 2x4 costs $24 ? Even $12 is high.
I'm on their website now. Cedar 2 x 4s are $14.  Spruce Pine Fir is $7.  Yellow pine studs are $1 - $2.
Is he framing with redwood and oak ?
"Yeah that comment is crap. I'm a project manager for a construction company. Havent noticed much of a change. I remember when everyone was scared as hell, but nobody in the industry even talks about the tariffs any more. "
"I did include a line on my contracts to cover my ass incase of price increase due to tariffs. However, that has never came up."
"pretty sure Asia is a huge IMPORTER of wood, but maybe I've heard wrong."
Yup. China is one of the largest importers of wood actually. 
Canada is the largest exporter and US is right under that at #2.
Further proving that comment was just made up nonsense.
Tariffs on china wont affect cost of wood in the US because we dont buy wood from China.
"My comment was more thinking of steel beams, studs, electrical components and lighting fixtures etc. A lot of that comes from China"
"I am a project manager for a construction company, and I'm telling you this comment is all bullshit. 2x4s at home depot are not $24 lmao. I've been purchasing material for large scale projects for 10 years now. I have not noticed much of a difference. Other than shipping time. "
Some things like light fixtures that come from China get held up a lot. Not sure if that even has anything to do with the tariffs though.
I'm betting your dad complained about somthing and you took it and rambled it into this bs comment.
"Trump's tariffs are not designed to be profitable in themselves, their purpose is to force other nations to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-may-end-up-being-one-of-the-greatest-free-trade-presidents-in-history/2018/07/26/6eb6e65e-90fc-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">lower</a> theirs. It can be disputed whether this is the best approach but one should at least grasp the basic intention."
It’s almost as if there was a free trade deal already drawn up that could have prevented all of this without taxing Americans
It's important to distinguish between the typical intent of tariffs and the intent of Trump's tariff strategy.
The typical intent is as you described.
"Trump's intent, as he has repeated ad nauseum, is to bring new revenue to the United States while protecting workers. He clearly has no grasp on who pays tariffs or the effects of trade wars on American labor. He lacks the nuance and and appropriate reciprocity to handle the trade wars which is part of why American manufacturing is stuttering out  in a ""record"" economy."
"He explicitly formulated that intent on numerous occasions. Yes, he also uses whatever antiquated pro-tariff argument there is and plays the chauvinist to say less economically sophisticated crowds. But in practice he has always used it in <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021909900941815809"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> manner."
"So, to be clear, it doesn't matter what he <em>says,</em> his actual motivations are something else?"
You Redcaps are the fucking worst
"I linked to one of his statements where he says that he wants to drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies."
Lol
"So fucking what? He says shit all the time that doesn't match reality at all, and you chucklefucks just make excuse after excuse for the fact that he's a liar"
"Along with what others said, I don't think it is the government's job to get involved because government Y is not letting Gerald buy my goods at a price we agree on."

How did this get upvoted? What is wrong with this sub?
I didn't advocate for anything. I proposed a view of the matter that to me seems closer to reality.
Nah bud. Your perception doesn’t make it reality. 
There’s a reason this article cites studies and you cite feelings.
I'm not contesting the notion that tariffs in themselves are not profitable.
"You won’t get anywhere with these guys, like Retardican-Republican. Most of these guys are obsessed leftist who paint everyone that disagrees with them fascist or Trump worshippers.

Great relationship with my parents, sisters and my wife’s family- even take family vacations together 3x a year. 6 figure income at a job that allows me more time to pursue my passions (travel, BJJ and cuisine) than it does stressing out about work. Was able to pay my $500,000 house and 3 acre lot off in 7 years. I also have multiple properties, equaling about 300 acres. So, no, I’m not projecting. Calling it as I see it."
I mean it's a view completely disconnected from reality and any field of economic theory
"It's tit-for-tat and one of the most basic and established principles in game theory and nature, also formulated as the intent by policy makers."
.....you have no idea what game theory actually is...do you?

Must be why the economy is booming
...and the deficit!
totally. that's why us economy booms and e.g. germany`s is tanking
The only metric really booming is the stock market and that’s mainly due to record stock buy backs by companies after their tax breaks. Everything else is stagnant or in decline.
The US GDP was revised downward three times in 2019 from 3.1% to 1.9%. I know you're a Trump nuthugger but the economy isn't booming.
The economy is not on any new trend line it hasn’t been on since 2010
"GDP growth has slowed., having peaked in 2015."
"Job creation has slowed, having peaked prior to 2017."
US manufacturing has contracted two of the last four quarters.
"How are <em>you</em> defining ""boom""?"
Because he thinks big numbers at NYSE and NASDAQ = the totality of economic prosperity
I'm pretty sure even in middle school I understood that the economy is more than one factor
Did you drop out before middle school?
Did you drop out before middle school?
"He's a trump supporter, what do you think?"
"I most certainly did. That's why I know, even though us consumers pay the tariffs, it ultimately is benefiting the economy. Maybe you will understand someday, that it is beneficial if you buy locally instead of importing from cheap countries."
"Maybe you will understand someday, that it is beneficial if you buy locally instead of importing from cheap countries."
"Your claim is that it's economically efficient to buy goods from uncompetitive, less productive producers? If so, your Econ 101 professor would like to have a word with you..."
It's ... benefiting the country?

It's always fun watching a MAGAtarian try to make a collectivist argument in a libertarian subreddit.
"Apparently, I'm better off when people in my collective are better off, even if it costs me more."
"You don't understand, pragerU said it's good"
"Therefore his pragerU degree in economics gives him the ability to fully understand the economy better than every ""economist"" in history"
"In 2016, the last year of President Obama, exports were $1.45 trillion, and imports were $2.19 trillion."
"In 2017, the first year of President Trump, exports were $1.55 trillion (up around 7%), and imports were $2.4 trillion (up around 10%)."
"In 2018, exports were $1.67 trillion (up around 8%, or up 15% over 2016).  Imports were $2.54 trillion (up around 6%, up 16% over 2016)."
"In 2019, the first six months show around an $8-billion decrease in exports, or down less than 1%, and imports are up around $3 billion, or up less than 0.25%."
"On August 14, the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that from July 2018 to July 2019, import prices were down 1.8%, and export prices were down 0.9%"
So which economic statistic shows that Trump's policies have hurt our relationship with trading partners around the world?  Which statistics show that the U.S. consumer has been hurt?  Think how much Trump's energy policies have helped the U.S. consumer. 
"The truth is, the U.S. economy is doing much better than most of the world and much better than projected precisely because of Trump's tax and regulatory policies.  Trump is right that China and other countries have gotten away with murder on trade for decades, and Trump is dealing with it after previous presidents and Congress looked the other way.  The media, in their reporting, act as though there were no tariffs prior to Trump, and that is an intentional attempt to mislead the public."
"If we had an honest media, instead of most journalists campaigning to elect Democrats and destroy Trump, they would cheer on the good economic results instead of seeking to remake America with massive job destruction in the private sector.  Why would anyone want to go back to Obama policies and worse that gave us the slowest economic recovery in seventy years?"
"all you have shown is that consumers are eating the costs. As you pointed out, imports haven't gone down, so who is paying the tariffs? Shouldn't those numbers of imports be going down if we are buying ""made in america""?"
previous presidents and Congress looked the other way.
That was the TTP. It was a free trade agreement designed to isolate China in their own backyard and bringing other Asian nations closer to the American economic sphere of influence. We had an option to use free trade and expanding into new markets while simultaneously taking away markets from China's SoI.
All of the other signatories have stated that the United States is still welcome to join the agreement that they had hammered out for years. The notion that tariffs are a good idea for isolating/fighting back against China is basically incorrect because there are much better options on the table. 
"Why this always gets interpreted as ""Trump is the only one to have done something about this"" is really beyond me."
"I've always said that while this may not be the best approach, some kind of action needs to be taken against China. I wouldnt want Americans buying Volkswagen cars under Hitler's regime. China is basically the definition of a fascist regime and are ethnically cleansing their country while quietly establishing themselves as the new world super power"
That's what the TPP was designed to do. Tariffs don't stop China from selling to other countries. A free trade partnership that cuts China out of the loop does.
""" I wouldnt want Americans buying Volkswagen cars under Hitler's regime. ""  Well you are free to not buy them not decide for others what they should or should not buy ... isn t that the libertarian view ? Or did it switch to ""i can enforce my will on others as long as it s the ""moral choice"" ?"
Didn't take long after the war. VW's were first imported to New York in January of 1949.
"Can add some of the Japanese manufacturers to that list. Plus Hugo Boss, BMW, etc."
I wonder why CNN didn't want to go to trial.  I thought the suit was completely baseless.  What is the world coming to when major news outlets can't slander minors for political purposes.
Probably because it’s a drawn out process that costs money. Between 80 and 92% of cases get settled instead of go to trial. 
"<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/business/08law.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/business/08law.html</a>"
The people here commenting like that’s a guaranteed loss for CNN don’t really understand how lawsuits work and just want to hate on CNN. 
"I feel like this case should be more 50/50 in this sub and for libertarians in general. CNN was recording footage in a public place. They also made claims about someone, but so do newspapers when someone is charged with a crime, and I don’t think anyone thinks those outlets should be sued when those indictments don’t pan out. "
"Shit, by this logic, Hillary Clinton should sue Donald Trump for making false claims about her."
"in the USA, you must pay your lawyer fees regardless of winning (most other first world nations require the other party to pay). So when it comes to these large cases, it is often cheaper to just settle."
But fake news Fredo (who said he would throw a guy down the fucking stairs) said this kid had an evil smile.

I see no sources anywhere. 
Perhaps you can provide them?

Oh good. 
So maybe stop spreading fake news?
“I heard he got $80 million” with no sources and you take it as possibly true. Lol     Maybe don’t be a moron
I guess I have heard that now too. Since you just said it baselessly...
Or you can stop trying to spread fake news. 
You’re life must be pretty sad if you can’t stfu about shit you don’t know anything about.
A reddit comment that is obviously sarcastic isn’t fake news.  
Your brain must be pretty sad if you can’t figure that out.
How is it “obviously sarcastic”?
Go ahead and edit your comment to show that you were making shit up if that’s what you were doing. 
"Otherwise, you are just trying to push fake news."
"Edit; oh, you’re a T_D user. Fake news is certainly all you know, so I’m gonna stop wasting my time with you."
Why would they settle for a hundred million?
Of course it will be an undisclosed amount. 
$100 million?  
“I heard...”
What part of this isn’t obviously a joke.
"So you’re gonna edit your comment to say it’s a joke, right?"
He got over 100$ million from the Washington Post too.

The smoking age was already 21 in 19 states before that bill was passed.  It was coming without the feds getting involved.  California was second. They had laws in 2016 that changed the age to 21.  Guess how that state voted?
"Yes I am aware of this, I live in Massachusetts, we’ve been 21 for a while and guess what it did? Absolutely nothing! Oh wait it did do something drove the tobacco sales up tenfold in NH. But my point is it’s one thing for the state to do it, it’s not the federal governments job to regulate it."
Why wouldn't you want it to be federally regulated?  Seems clearer and easier to regulate and control compared to the rules changing at every state border
because states are better at regulating their laws than the government in dc deciding for everyone
Yeah I'm in Ohio and Columbus changes it a couple years ago. Then comrade dewine signed it statewide
What I don't get about the war on drugs is that arresting people hurting themselves by using drugs makes no sense. It's like harming someone because they harmed themselves.

Plus their voters are getting poorer and poorer and if they stop with protectionism then they might have a few hard questions to answer like:
"Hey, we thought that tax cuts would lead to more money for us?"
"I suspect they have to pretend to be doing something for the working people, and people that need social spending, while they make things worse."
I'm guessing the drama will end if or when the deregulatory and tax agenda is got right for them.

Looks like some direct hits on hangers.  Really gives credibility to the claim they tried to avoid taking lives.
"Thanks for this article, I had not heard of Planet Labs before, an interesting rabbit hole for me to fall down this evening.  "
"On to a question relevant to the story, do we know the level of sophistication of these missiles and the guidance systems?  Are they accurate like the smart bomb videos we would see on the news when the US is conducting strikes?  I ask because I think the article said ""other missiles failed while in flight"" and didn't know if that was still a regular occurrence for all cruise missiles, regardless of the country making them.  "
"No agenda with these questions, honestly ignorant as to the military technology of other countries."
"My completely unqualified read, their guidance system is top notch, but the missiles have other reliablitiy issues.  "
It was reported by Al Jazera that Iran used their Fateh 313 ballistic missiles.
"Guidance System/ Accuracy<br/>
GPS and Inertial Guidance/ Unknown"
"<a href=""https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/todays-missile-threat/iran/fateh-313/"">https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/todays-missile-threat/iran/fateh-313/</a>"
Appreciate the additional info!
"On to a question relevant to the story, do we know the level of sophistication of these missiles and the guidance systems?"
"I wish I could find the article that discussed this, but the TL;DR; is that these are very simple systems.  They're ground-to-ground, mobile, and focused on hitting stationary targets based almost entirely off the math executed at launch."
"These aren't ""cruise missiles"" (functionally kamakazi drones), they're ballistic (think self-propelled mortar shells)."
"But they're incredibly fast-moving and - with a proper payload - can cause serious havoc.  What's notable about these missiles is that they didn't appear to have much (if any) of a payload.  The near-zero casualty rate reported by the US suggests that they weren't armed.  That, combined with their targets being primarily warehouses and the US having lots of early warning in advance of the strike, spared a great deal of human life."
"The threat to launch a salvo at Dubai or Hafha is absolutely chilling, given the kind of damage they could inflict.  And I suspect it was the warning - along with the proof-of-concept in the salvo - that forced Trump to back down."
"That’s interesting, I appreciate the info!"
"It really looks like this was a very cautious, calculated response from Iran, to make what seems like a statement to the world and their citizens, that they will not just lay down and except embarrassment and world humiliation, without some answer...  while at the same time, making sure they dont do anything extreme, so to force a harsh response from the US. A clever way to huff and puff, and hold on to some degree of pride, while in reality they have their tail between their legs and know they dont have an answer. As long as we show restraint, I don't see Iran playing too dangerous of games with us going forward."
There are a few good things about this. It means there won't be any escalation.
Maybe we can finally put an end to the boomer wars which have been going on my entire adult life? That might be wishful thinking.
• It means U.S.\Israel power is diminishing due to the fact they even had to grant an attack on U.S. bases.
How does it mean this?
"At the height of U.S. power they would have never even permitted something like this, even an attack on empty U.S. bases. The U.S has been weakened after Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no militarily or political way the U.S. can go into a full scale war with Iran."
Wishful thinking.
At the height of its power the US merely sanctioned Iran for supposed genocide.
"If the Iranians didn’t intentionally blow holes in unoccupied desert here (which they did, because they are pussies), then they proved they can’t hit shit."
And Salami is still roasted
"What exactly do you get from this? How does any of these wars improve your life or American lives? The U.S. is just Israel's bitch, fighting all their enemies for them."
Salami killed plenty of Americans.
Now he has paid the price for that and will kill no more.

They didn't have to do anything. US and Israel could both wipe Tehran government out independently. They allowed it to happen. There a billion reasons they might do that without withdrawing starting with there being nothing gained from this war. 
"MIC is at near full throttle, and a failed iranian war could cost them long term. Iran is struggling with protests and giving them a common enemy isnt helpful. Iraq new PM is upcoming. Trump gets a feather in his cap."
The U.S. and maybe Israel could defeat Iran but at enormous costs. It would be a much tougher war than Iraq or Afghanistan and there is no political support in the U.S. for a war like that again.
The U.S. and maybe Israel could defeat Iran but not at enormous costs.
Iran and irans government are different. It costs little to bomb and destroy a centralized government. US destroyed Iraq's in under a week twice. Tehrans is only slightly less centralized under the religious leader. 
It's trying to rebuild that costs money. Israel doesnt rebuild however.
"Do you think leaders are just going to sit in government building and wait to be bombed? The U.S war gamed this in 2002 and it didn't go well for team U.S.A. That was in 2002 before the Iraq war, now Iran has militias all over Iraq. It would be much harder than Iraq or Afghanistan. The U.S. has been basically defeated in Afghanistan, as soon as they leave the country will be turned over to the Taliban again. We have been stuck there for almost 20 years now. "

"Of course not. Nor do they need to.  You assume this war would be anything like Afghanistan. It be like phase 1 Iraq where we roll it, find the guy and eliminate him. After that, you can leave Iran."
"You assume that simply because you destroy something, you need to hold it. That is not the case. America routinely knocks shit over then leaves. It's the MO in some places. Nation buildings much rarer."
Doing that would benefit the U.S how? What benefit has the U.S. or anybody in the Middle East gotten from all these wars?

See my initial point. It doesn't.

The dollar is built partially on America meddling.
"The dollar would almost be considered to be backed by oil now though. Oil is traded exclusively in U.S dollars. Meaning any country that wants oil needs U.S dollars. Early November, 2019, Iran released a statement saying they found a massive oil deposit that would add an additional 1/3rd to their oil reserves."
"Anyone else find it ironic that when Trump bombed an airfield doing minimal damage in Syria, he was praised for being so strong, but when Iran did it, everyone is saying how great America is..."

"It makes sense to me why they want to keep it closed door. The dems leak everything and if we are sending our troops into harms way, it would be bes not to publicize military strategy. Does anyone else think that telling your enemy what you are going to do before you do it is a bad idea?"
You cant exclude Democrats because they'll leak.
Ok but what does your comment have to do with the post?
"I think the belief that the government can take our money, spend it on programs that have proven not to work, and when they barley do they are slow and expensive, is quite radical."
Food stamps hasn't been a successful program?
"The fact that they had to have an entire overhaul of the system because people would sign up for them, sell them because they didn't want the food, and buy drugs with them, tells you that it was absolutely a horrible system. That's why it no longer exists"
"Yeah, all systems need updates and people will take advantage of them. That doesn't mean it hasn't been a successful program."
And food stamps still exist.
Yes. That's exactly what it means. There are plenty of charities that do a great job at making sure that the people who need benefitting get what they need. With 30% less waste than federal programs
The SNAP program has a 7 percent overhead. That's very low. Most charitable organizations have costs far higher than that and they help far fewer people. 
Where are you getting these numbers from?
"You're missing the point. I don't care. My point is that you pick where it's going. And on average federal programs go through a lot of bureaucracy, even if the SNAP program didn't, that's irrelevant. I should have the choice of picking where my money goes. Don't you think? The directness of the money is just a proxy but it's absolutely not why I believe what I do. Even if federal programs went 100% where they are supped to I would still be against them as they are. I would be on board if we all had a more direct vote and a transparent one at that at the state level. Job markets change by state. It would just make more sense that way"
"The ability to choose which charity your money goes to is the MAIN PROBLEM with private charities. It basically means that minorities will be completely screwed since charities that help them will be severely underfunded. Or people with ""unpopular"" problems like drug addiction."
Yeah. I don't see the problem
"People dying, no problem. Go suck a callous dick, you callous dick."
You don't care if the program has been successful or not? I mean you said it wasn't successful so I figured you knew something about it I didn't.
Exactly. I don't care. I couldn't care less if I'm being honest
"So then you have no evidence that it isn't successful. Okay, glad we got that sorted out."
You're missing the point. I don't care.
...
I couldn't care less if I'm being honest
...
Yeah I think that's the point everyone else is getting here.
I don't see it. People aren't really making points. More ad hominems than anything
Show me a charity that covers as many people as a government charity and does it 30% better and I will eat myself.
"That's the point. The federal government has way top far of a reach. Charities are small for a reason. You know what you're donating to. That's like saying, ""Show me a pair of shoes that are heavier than a pickup truck."" They're not designed the same way for a reason. When charities specialize you know exactly where it's going."
"And now imagine a person who is not covered by these small and specialized charities, guess he dies then."
What? That doesn't make any sense. There are a shit ton of these specialized charities. Plenty of which most people would qualify for. There is no excuse here. You're horribly misinformed. If the federal government were to break down tomorrow nobody would die of hunger. At least not more than already are.
Your mouth keeps moving yet no evidence is there to back it up. And when you make stupid statements you just pretend that you never said it and run away.
So something is a failure if it is not perfect from the start?
"Man, I really hope you are never in charge of anything:"
"""Sir, we have launched a project and it has issues that we did not think of but now we can address them"""
"""Nope, scrap the entire thing, it is a failure"""
It's clear you're just here to strawman. I have mever stated that. You've done nothing but put words in my mouth. Have a good day
I HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT FOR MY OBVIOUS BULLSHIT
"GOOD DAY SIR, god you are pathetic"
And I think that relying on private charities which have proven to not work either (otherwise why did we get government involved in the first place) is the definition of insanity. But libertarians coming up with tried and failed ideas and demanding people to try them is par for the course.
I never said that
You do know that social security isn't a charity? It's a retirement program we pay into and later receive benifits from.
That's our money.
Let us ignore the fact that we tried having only private charities and it did not work out
Here is why government should be in charge of charity. It does not care:
"Whether you are religious or not, unlike churches who will either try to use the charity to convert you or push you away"
"What gender you are, note how many more female domestic violence shelters there are compared to male ones. And women are abusers almost as often as men are. "
"What ethnicity you are, people contribute to charities that help their people for the most part. So if you are of a really tiny minority then you are fucked"
"What your problems are. Imagine a charity that gives money to drug addicts. There would be outrage, MONEY FOR DRUGGIES!?!?! people will shout. So if you are an addict and down on your luck then good luck"
"What orientation you are. Trans and gay people get kicked out by their own families quite often, what are the odds that charities geared towards them will get proper funding?"
"Where you are. Most private charities will exist in cities, close to their donors and people who need them. Nobody is going to bother with charities to help some tiny little village or town. "
What disease you have. Note how much less money lung cancer research gets compared to colorectal cancer. Why? Because we have decided that if you have lung cancer it is because you are a smoker and deserve it. Despite the fact that the most common type of lung cancer is adenocarcinoma that is unrelated to smoking. 
"And so on. Private charities are great on small and local scale to provide more specialized assistance to certain groups. It is great when they exist on top of decent social safety nets and catch those that fall through the cracks or provide more cushioning. However, if they were to become the only net then we would be in a lot of trouble. "
"At the end of the day, people willing help only those to whom they can relate."
Edit:
And a very important point that I forgot. 
"-Charities have notoriously gone bankrupt during times of great crisis. Because the demand for their services increases, yet donations slow down since everyone is hurting. Government has no issue procuring funding."
Let us ignore the fact that we tried having only private charities and it did not work out
It would be helpful to others if you would provide a source/evidence for your very first proclamation before going on.
"Human history. But for USA specifically: Great Depression with people dying in the streets, note how many government programs were enacted back then. Best part? People were starving despite USA still producing plenty of food."
Nobody starved to death in the US before food stamps.
Yes they did. That's literally why the program was started. We were tried of watching people starve to death in our country.
We have tried charity and to be frank it isn't sufficient. 
Large systemic problems need to be met with large system wide solutions.
"Libertarians are not interested in solving problems. As long as they keep their money, the rest can starve and die. They might donate a few bucks to make themselves feel good and that's it."
Most Libertarians couldn't name 5 libertarian principals. Most of them are closer to Republicans or Anarchist.
"Haha, that is true. I would love to see them try to live in an anrchist society. They would run back to the closest DMV office and cry with relief."
"Yeah, for a group of people who are supposed to believe in liberties they are quite intent on taking away all protections for those liberties."
But dont you understand these protections are just onerous regulation that is completely unnecessary because nobody will ever try to take liberties in a libertarian society.
And that's why we need to get rid of the Civil Rights Act because racism cannot exist in the free market.
"Yeah, my favorite is when they go after the Food and Drug Administration. Clearly no company would sell you tainted food or bad drugs."
Why would a business poison its customers silly? 
"Except, they forget that no business starts like that. They cut one corner, then the next and by the time people are dying there is no single person that blame can be pinned on. The company quickly declares bankruptcy and we have dead people with no compensation for their survivors. That's freedom baby."
"Sure why not, as long as it gets its fu ds voluntarily. Social security is not a charity btw"
Who?
"Idk, stampedes are pretty far out there."
Ever been to a Walmart on Thanksgiving?
"Of course, exactly like the stampede in Iran."
Hillsborough then?
There’s also been some incidents in the US and other western countries this century.  Mostly involving nightclubs and some sporting events.
"Just looked it up, maybe Brits have more in common with Iran than we do 😂"
"This isn't new, from the note you can see this is reserve management purchase. When the Fed sets a target interest rate they don't simply decree it and it is so because of the market."
They may need to buy/sell bonds to push the market into what ever direction they want. However they have been doing this as part of Open market Operations since the FED was established.
"So not making any sort of statement but this is nothing new, its just a mundane FED Open market operations transaction that has been going on since the 1940s"
It's because they're retarded

"The federal government has attempted (and many states have succeeded in) passing legislation that punishes people who boycott Israel on humanitarian grounds, or who speak out in support of boycotting Israel."
"Clearly, this is a violation of 1A rights: government using its power to censor speech."
"So, to everyone upvoting this: when? When do you do something about it? When do you walk the walk instead of just talking the talk?"
What does boycotting Israel mean?
He's referring to the anti-Israel BDS movement which seeks to have people in charge of public money boycot Israel and companies that do business in Israel.  This includes even American companies like Caterpillar (whose only crime is building the tractors that have been used to bulldoze settlements in the conflict zones)
"The federal/state legislation says ""you have a duty to the taxpayer and a fiduciary responsibility, you can't just boycott using money that doesn't belong to you""  -- which is PERFECTLY logical and reasonable, and protects the taxpayer from financial damage brought about by the personal politics of the people who spend our tax dollars.  If the public is best served by the government buying a Caterpillar tractor rather than a competitor's model, then the public dollars should be spent on the Caterpillar.  Politics should be set aside and the most beneficial contract secured."
"IPredictAReddit knows all of this and routinely lies about what BDS is, and the legislation against it."
"Here's an example of how unhinged the BDS folks are <a href=""https://twitter.com/BDSmovement/status/1170351036198019073"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/BDSmovement/status/1170351036198019073</a>"
"Funny, I would think the repeated and unconstitutional gun restrictions placed on the citizens would be a far more pertinent and constitutional reason to invoke the 2nd Amendment."
"But I guess if you just really, really hate Jews, that matters more."
Israel is not Judaism.  Anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism.
They aren't exactly mutually exclusive either
"Boycotting/speaking out against Israel does not equal hatred of Jews. Israel does not represent all Jews, nor does it act on behalf of all Jews."
"If you're okay with gun restrictions, and restrictions on other speech, but the only problem you have is with outlawing speech against Israel, then you don't give a shit about freedom or liberty.  You just hate Jews.  And you're perfectly fine with other freedoms being stripped away as long as you get to bash Jews."
I'm not OK with gun restrictions or restrictions on other forms of speech. I don't think the OP has demonstrated that they are fine with that either. I'm not sure where that's coming from.
"That's a really bullshit false equivalency.  I don't hate Jews, and I don't support most of the shit Israel does.  Know who else I don't hate?  Muslims.  I don't support Iran, but no one is saying I hate all Muslims."
"Never, because the first ones to welcome tyranny are people insecure enough to build an arsenal. They need a tyrant to keep them safe."
"Sir, this is an Arby's drive-thru."
Nobody has been punished for boycotting Israel with their own money.  Stop lying.
People <em>in charge of public money</em> aren't allowed to boycott Israel using the people's money.   They have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer  that supersedes their own politics.
Nobody has been punished for boycotting Israel with their own money.

"That's a shame, jury nullification is one of the last resorts against federal tyranny. I hope this case gets appealed to the Supreme Court."
"SCOTUS and the appeals courts have ruled that informing juries of nullification is not allowed. Nullification must come naturally, not through a judge's instruction."
Those judges should be removed from their bench with extreme prejudice.
There is no case law saying juries cannot be informed of nullification.  There is only case law saying they do not have to be informed of it  which is wrong even in itself.  Two states even require the jury to be informed of their right and moral obligation to judge both the facts and the law.
"There is no case law saying juries cannot be informed of nullification,"
Yes there is..
U.S. v. Moylan
United States v. Dougherty
United States v. Thomas
Edit:
Two states even require the jury to be informed of their right and moral obligation to judge both the facts and the law.
Federal isnt state. Different rules.
Moylan and Dougherty upheld the courts right to refuse giving the jury information.  Neither prohibits it.
"Thomas is just a bad ruling that should be overturned, but it again doesn't prohibit jury nullification.  It allows the removal of jurors who are going to nullify.  It does not require it, nor can it affect a jury decision that was already made."
"The particularly troublesome case is U.S. v. Krzysk.
In that case the jury asked the judge about nullification and he flat out lied to them.  Nonetheless the conviction was upheld even though the judge flat out gave false information to the jury."
"Great piece, Jeffrey Tucker did a great job breaking it down."
Would definitely recommend reading the whole article. It does a good job of describing the strangeness around different factions all somehow claiming libertarian principles. 
"After a while, I came to a new realization of the malleability of words, particularly in a political context. There seemed to be many things sailing under the label libertarian. My libertarianism I believed to be the embrace of peace and prosperity through universal human emancipation via the disempowerment of statism at all levels of society, with the purpose of enabling human flourishing."
But there was another view becoming entrenched: libertarianism is nothing more than a demand that the ruling state establishment die the death because it is preventing some people from having the kind of power they want. The power to do what? Maybe you don’t want to know.
"The movement I recall from that period was becoming brutal and entirely too tolerant of hoary and ill-educated belligerence from speakers’ platforms and podcasts. The message seemed to be that if you were mad enough about something, you were a libertarian. And this much I saw coming and predicated: After their guy did not become president (it’s amazing anyone believed it was possible), they moved on to other things. They were still political but things got weird really fast."
*Hollowed
Brian Kilmeade from fox wrote a book on this. I read it some years ago. I thought it was quite good and pointed out Jefferson recognized they (the pirates) wouldnt stop and had his own (jefferson) Quran highlighting some points on their willingness to fight forever due to their religious beliefs. Yet hes been very vocal about attacking iran and we can win in the middle east and need our presence there blah blah. His own book acknowledges that will never happen.
"This should be a lot more simple.  If we are going to have a (representative) democracy, then every adult should get to vote, if they choose, without any exceptions at all."
I think people actively in prison shouldn't be allowed to vote. Once out they should be able to.
Ok but are the Republicans going to cut taxes and wave guns around at the rally?
This is my shocked face.
Imagine that Republicans disenfranchising voters
My guess is 'as extensive as you think... and more.'
"Missiles, not rockets."
I was thinking why is SpaceX landing in Iraq?
"Is there a quick ELI5 on the differences between rockets, missiles, and anything else that has their lines blurred between them all?"
In military terms a rocket is an unguided munition that is powered by a rocket motor. A missile is a self guided munition that is powered by a rocket motor (be it main propulsion or boost propulsion) and/or a turbofan or turbojet.
In other words a rocket is “dumb” while a missile is “smart”.
"Rockets-Bad if they hit something
Missiles-Good if they hit something"
They retaliated against our retaliation against their retaliation against our retaliation against their retaliation against our retaliation against their retaliation against our retaliation against their retaliation against our retaliation against their retaliation against our retaliation?!
We should retaliate.  That’ll solve it!
"at the beginning of that long chain of retaliations is the US, overthrowing a government"
But at the <em>very</em> beginning:
"<em>Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys give them thumbs, they make a club
And beat their brother down
How they survive so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a Creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here</em>"
"Well, that’s stuck in my head now"
I get that reference.
I didn't this was my favorite song by tool until now
"And instating one that is even more authoritarian, oppressive, and overall shit at governing "
Karzai I’m looking at you...
Yeah but you're leaving out the key context that we had to overthrow their government because they wouldn't do whatever we wanted and wanted the oil in their own region. We had a right to that oil because we're America and we wanted it.
"That was the UK, not the US.  Iran nationalized UK property (which yes, does tend to piss people off), ironically in part because they were jealous that Saudi Arabia had negotiated much better deals with US companies."
And another wave of Muslims that hate America (for good reason). The cycle continues....
"Except the ""retaliation"" by the US was against a general. Last I checked Iran never directly attacked the US military let alone a general."
"Anyways, the coup started it, supporting Saddam as he was using chemical weapons on the civilians is kind of a big deal, and the sanction currently killing innocent people with no basis at all."
Can we just make it clear...
FUCK  Khamenei and the Iran regime
"FUCK Trump, Pompeo, and Pence"
We can make a difference about the second group though. We won't but we could.
So who do you want to fuck you?
Ivanka....?
Checks out. You may comment here.
its an old code but it checks out.
Absolute madman but respect
Yes.
Fuck warmongering statists everywhere
And F Obama for not repealing overreaching presidential powers made by Bush and instead expanded them leaving us in this situation
Obama has nothing to do with this
"Damn, the war drums in <a href=""/r/Conservative"">r/Conservative</a> is downright sickening with calls for war crimes to boot. "
Dem tax cuts though
I expect all of them to be at the recruitment office first thing in the morning.
"In a brilliant turn of events, Trump decides to sacrifice supporters! "
"If you check out askTrumpsupporters, the ones who are very pro-war with Iran admittingly would never join the military."
Republicans talking the talk but not walking the walk? Stop the fucking presses.
"What makes me fume is that no matter how Trump responds, his supporters will claim it as a win. He can make two 100% different choices on a spectrum and he still gets his cake."
If he retaliates with the intensity of a thousands suns? Fuck yeah America! They messed with the wrong reality TV show star!
"He walks it back? Omg, he is showing so much humility! the dems never believed in him! "
"It's like, obviously I want him to deescalate but I'm also frustrated in that no matter what he gets satisfaction. At this point it's not even that he could shoot someone on 5th Ave and not lose support, he could fucking nuke 5th Ave and his supporters would just be like ""oh I like what he's done with the place."""
As long as I live I will never forgive the people in my life who voted for him because they didn't <em>like</em> Hilary or were afraid to vote for a libertarian candidate because it costed them their vote. We knew his playbook. It was obvious what would happen.
That's the benefit of undermining the concept of truth. Get used to it. All you can do is maintain a few touchstones of sanity so you don't get gaslighted.

Yep. This shit is why I’ve started just saying to Trump supporters “don’t vote.”
Nobody can convince me that Clinton would have been worse. It’s simply not a true statement. 
I can accept that they thought that at the time. I cannot accept that they still think that and conclude they’re anything other than disingenuous trolls.
"P. J. O'Rourke said in 2016 that Hillary was ""wrong within normal parameters."""
Turns out he hit the nail on the fucking head.
But tax cuts? If I have more money in pocket then I can totally buy the private security to protect me from the racists trying to lynch me.
Well.... obviously not tax cuts for me or any other people in the middle class but damn at least the economy is great even though everything seems to be more expensive and harder to get.
Or end up getting an extra 1k at the end of the year but end up spending 10k more for all the things that have been cut.
Honestly. Every video I see of people explaining why they support Trump and why they’ll be voting for them again is either a generic “he’s the man” or like 80% is them saying how well the economy is going yet looking like they haven’t bought new clothes in years or seen a doctor. It’s astonishing.
"Imagine that you are poor. Not only that, but you are poor in USA. A country where your class is determined by your wealth."
"Nobody wants to admit that they are poor in USA because if you admit that then you have to admit that you are lower class. Everyone wants to be middle class. People on food stamps will claim that they are ""lower middle class"". "
"So they pretend that their current situation is just a temporary one, any day now they will make it big and become millionaires. They believe in that so hard that they genuinely start acting as if they are already millionaires. Honestly, it is still insane to me how people buy a house that they will need to spend the next 50 years paying off. "
"And if you are convinced that you will be a millionaire any day now, then it only makes sense that you cheer policies that millionaires champion. Inheritance tax is bad because obviously you are going to be leaving millions to your kids. Taxes are bad because obviously you are in the highest tax bracket. Welfare is bad because only losers are on welfare (except for you, you genuinely need it, everyone else is a loser). And so on."
Trump is like prosperity gospel but in politics. If only we make the billionaires richer then we will be millionaires in no time.
It’s a cult.
Would you have wanted Hillary instead?
"Turd sandwich was a way better option than the orange dipshit, yes."
She would have been largely ineffective since republicans were talking about impeaching her before the election even happened. And at least she was qualified unlike Trump who has been on a learning curve. I'm still amazed that he admitted he didn't understand healthcare after claiming he had a great plan and none of his supporters cared.
"Ideally neither, but in this specific case yes since the Iran deal would have stayed in place and Hillary did not belong to a constituency or political bloc that wanted war with Iran, unlike Trump."
Yup
Preferably......neither
I would want the fake Hillary that Republicans fearmongered about more than this.
Lmao ur funny
"I’m pro America. If they attacked us, I’d enlist."
I doubt their parents would let them drop out of high school. 
Oh who am I kidding they were never educated to begin with.
But they won’t be. It’s so upsetting that these monsters get to do this every 8 years and be completely forgiven by the public.
Every 8 years? Are you implying that democrats don't send people to war?
Iraq War was Bush
And they beat the war drum just how the Republicans are now
Syria Yemen the overthrow of gaddafi? Bush do that too? How about more drone strikes even targeting wedding parties to take out terrorists? Thats cool? All bush?
"So you agree, Republicans start wars and then literally bang the war drums on their media outlets?"
So you agree bush didn’t overthrow gaddaffi and drone strike Assad in Syria? And CNN abc and nbc didn’t air a fake attack from turkey on the Kurds with footage from a shooting range? Good job feeding the uniparty if you believe that. Both sides paint the picture they want you to see. There isn’t a completely unbiased news source .
"Which ones of those had US soldiers dying en mass? Oh, right, none of them."
And the current administration didn’t start any of this. Iranian aggression has been going on for months now. And US soldiers haven’t died en masse at all. That also doesn’t justify attacking Yemen and Syria and replacing Gaddaffi. Neither of those nations attacked the United States at all. But we sure as hell went in under Obama nobody was crying about that. Iranians attack a us embassy killing Americans and we retialite and people shit their pants because we are fighting back against hostility? Wtf
"Yikes, I just went there and I'm actually in shock. Tucker had some people on his show and almost every one said we need to back down and get out of Iraq/Afghanistan. Surprised they weren't beating the war drums"
"They wanted to beat the drums, not actually start a war. They're much happier with this nebulous never ending insurgency."
"Hard to stir the pot with islamaphobia when you kill all the ""evil"" muslim countries."

Sarcasm aside. Looks like we got ourselves war bois. Buy military-related stocks while they are hot.
At least there haven't been <del>any</del> many casualties so far.
What makes you think this starts a war?
The fact that tensions have been escalating since the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal and now the countries are not fighting via proxy any more but have directly attacked each other.
It's not exactly a controversial conclusion. Two countries attacking each other is war.
Literally where? All the upvoted comments are anti-war? Why are you getting upvoted when you’re just lying

I will give it to you though, there was a very pro-war comment made by OP when he said “I call dibs on the A-10,” and then he later said he supported leaving entirely."

"Everyone is hung up on how many innocent people are likely to die from this, but nobody remembers to give the GOP credit for cutting taxes for the rich"
The tax cuts benefit you too even if you're not rich as long as you invest in the stock market.
"35% corporate tax was utterly ridiculous anyway, even with deductions. There are ex-commie countries that don't have anywhere close to 35%. Should be 5% max."
The tax cuts benefit you too even if you're not rich as long as you invest in the stock market.
10/10 satire lol
Most if not all pension accounts are tied to the stock market.
You can also invest on your own without being rich so yes I do benefit from having lower corporate tax rates. That translates into higher profits which probably translates into higher share prices and higher dividends.
"Suck it, socialist. L2invest."
Am I insane? Come to libertarian sub. They shit on lower taxes? Wtf is this shit .. Republicans and orang man bad. Think half this sub is just we want to so drugs I’m libertarian.
Lower taxes without spending cuts are just a loan from the future tax paying base. A loan they didn’t consent to. That’s theft.
"News flash, no deficit spending still exists and I can at least save and invest and pass the gains on to the next generation. Did you consent to these current taxes? Nether did I, that’s theft, give me my money and labor."
no deficit spending still exists
Holy fuck are you actually retarded? Trump has ballooned the deficit over a trillion. Obama shrunk it.
Please don’t vote.
Obviously a typo. Please don’t reproduce. I can ad-hominem too !
It’s pretty obviously not a typo.
Really? It was meant to insinuate  deficit spending has been going on for decades and hasn’t changed. But hey don’t actually address the argument presented .

This is the comment I'm following. 
Iranian air force has reportedly taken off 
US planes take off from UAE which implicates UAE for retaliation as well.
"Iranian planes aren't going to cross into Iraq, they are severely over matched."
"Most likely, both sides will just patrol the borders."
UAE wasnt a target why would we patrol borders there? 
You might be right about Iran however. That makes sense
Taking off from UAE to patrol Iraq air space.
You don’t remember Saudi Arabia oil field being attacked like 2 months ago? How about Iran shooting down our drones or 6 oil tankers being attacked in the straight of Hormuz ? Sure they are still not happy about it .
Maybe not but they sure as hell are sending missiles over the border.

Terrorist organizations.... witty comeback
"This is fake news. I was told by Trump and his supporters that killing Soleimani was going to make Iran back down and make Americans safer, and they're totally not liars or retarded."
I was told that by someone in this subreddit only a couple days ago.  They were convicted there wouldn’t be consequences to the assassination because the Iranian government wouldn’t dare risk war with the US because of our oVerWhelmiNg MiliTarY mIgHt.
"Sounds like you were talking to an <a href=""/r/conservative"">r/conservative</a> poster that wandered in here."
"Wow. I thought Donald Trump prevented a war. What’s going on here, redcaps? Why isn’t the plan working?"
The problem is that Trump is trying so hard to seem like a bad ass that he has forgotten one of the major things about international relations:  Other countries need to be able to predict how a nation -- regardless if they are a friend or foe -- will react to a given situation.  
"So, when Obama took military action it was when the enemy knew he would take military action.   And American Allies knew when he would as well.   Everyone knew the rules Obama was using. "
"Trump, by being unpredictable, it making everyone else unpredictable.   And in the case of Iran, they feel that if they are going to be damned if they try and play by established norms, then they might as well not play by them. "
"Iran is a bad actor in the region.   At the same time, they way to stop them from being that bad actor is not by being worse than them.   Trump seems to think there are magic buttons to push, and now he is finding that those buttons will just cause shit to explode in his face. "
Not that he cares much.  Trump is very likely figuring that he might distract the American people from impeachment with a war.  He's literally playing the Wag the Dog game here.     This isn't about Iran being a bad actor on the international stage.  This is about Trumps ego and nothing more.  And Trump is going to get American soldiers killed because he has ego problems.   And Trump is fine with them dying for his ego.  Cause Trump is a sad little baby.
"Prisoner's dilemma in game theory: When one side defects, you rationally have to defect until there is equilibrium again."
Equilibrium being the god damn nuclear deal.
Problem is equilibrium may only return to the real world after a nuclear exchange has killed hundreds of millions of people.   Armature idiots can accidentally get a lot of people killed.  Especially when they think they're high IQ experts at things they clearly are not experts at.
"Oh yes, there's no doubt about it, this is going to cost everyone much more in the near future."
I think he's trying to establish a red-line. Playing chicken with Iran could backfire though...
"Now watch the Trumpkins defense be ""bUT iRAn sTaRtED iT"""

"You realize that our embassies get attacked frequently, right?"
"The appropriate response is not to fucking assassinate someone, period"
"That s why you put in charge people that can think at a lvl above kinder garden logic . The attack on the embassy was a provocation . You react you serve the propaganda that fuels an anti US sentiment . DO you want that ? No . So what do you do ? You bite your tongue and you look at the bigger picture . The attack on the embassy was a success for the US because they didn't shoot the attackers while still not suffering casualties , it was only material damage . But how can that be a win you may ask . By denying them the propaganda material they were seeking . But guess what ? They still got it because someone was so butt hurt that he had to serve to Iran the perfect propaganda material by creating a fucking martyr . Now the problem is that it silences the moderates in Iran because like in any country under attack you stick with the authority , and it galvanizes the radicals .  That s why there are diplomats , they are the cool headed people who look at the bigger picture and are supposed to be more concerned about the repercussions of any action than how it makes them look on that day ."
this guy diplofucks. 
"And to the people saying they attacked our embassy, it wasn't even close. They threw rocks and damaged an unsecured room of the facility. Wow! what an attack."
I don't have an answer. But it's my opinion that maybe going through the proper channels first would've been a better start. An impeached president not letting congress know beforehand is just crazy to think about. Hope any further deaths are worth it.
attacking 
"Let's be honest, ""attacking"" is a pretty extreme word to use when you realize what the next two steps have been after that."
"I think we invited trouble the moment we abandoned the Iran nuclear deal. So, that doesn’t exactly answer your question, but that action didn’t encourage diplomacy over violence."
At the very least speak to congress before you kill people.
"Said it when Trump assassinated Soleimani, I'll say it again: voting matters."
I voted for the anti interventionalist last election. And we got this guy. I'll vote for the LP again in 2020. But we will get this guy.
"""I claim to dislike Trump, but I won't vote for anyone who has a chance at beating him."""

"I was told that my vote was wasted because I voted based on the issues I believe in. I was also told my vote took away a vote from the Republican party, then later told by the same person that my vote took away a vote from the Democratic party's ability to beat the Republican party."
"My vote will always matter, and it will always be based on whatever I choose the reasoning to be. Best part is I answer to noone when it comes to my vote. That tends to make others mad, and they think I am stuck up or pompous because of it."
"While I agree with your overall point, you answer to every other citizen for your vote."
Doesn't matter unless you live in a swing state anyways.
Welcome to U.S. Democracy.
they think I am stuck up or pompous because of it.
Disengaging from meaningful politics while still wanting people to take your political opinion seriously <em>is</em> pretty stuck up and pompous.
So you prefer Trump to any Democratic candidate?  And libertarians wonder why they're widely viewed as Republicans who smoke weed.
weed
You clearly haven't been to a LP convention. They do shit way harder than weed. Crackhead capital of the world.

"Israel won't allow that to happen, and if Israel goes in to prevent it so will the U.S., the nuclear deal was the out."
How pathetic are you that you're actually rooting for a brutal dictatorship to have access to nuclear missiles. The same country that murders gays and restricts human rights on the daily.
No one wants Trump blasting away at Iran but this kind of frothing at the mouth is peak delusion.
How fucking sad.
The same country that murders gays
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonationalism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonationalism</a>"
"The term was originally proposed by the researcher in gender studies Jasbir K. Puar in 2007 to refer to the processes by which some powers line up with the claims of the LGBTI community in order to justify racist, xenophobic and aporophobic positions, especially against Islam, basing them on prejudices that migrant people are supposedly homophobic and that Western society is entirely egalitarian. Thus, sexual diversity and LGBT rights are used to sustain political stances against immigration, being increasingly common among far-right parties."
If right wingers actually gave a shit about LGBT people they wouldn't only object to the mistreatment of LGBT people in countries they want to invade.
How does a definition of homonationalism negate that Iran executes homosexuals for the crime of homosexuality?
"What does Iran's record on homosexuality have to do with whether we should go to war with them, or whether they should have nukes?"
"The answer is nothing -- besides some form of ""these are bad people and we should have the right to police them"" argument that ordinarily libertarians would abhor.  Their record on homosexuality has nothing to do with (for instance) whether they're posing an imminent military threat to the U.S. or its allies, or whether the deterrent benefits of nuclear arms would outweigh the risk of nukes being used.  "
"In this context -- discussing the very real possibility of war with Iran over mutual military exchanges -- this talking point is no more than empty pro-war propaganda.  Right wingers don't give a shit about LGBT rights themselves; they'll just toot that horn when they're trying to ramp up Islamophobia to support a war in the Middle East.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Iraq"" rel=""nofollow"">Iraq</a> is far behind the U.S. on gay rights and you don't hear the right wing harping on that, despite our much greater influence over that country."
"Literally the only country to have ever used not one, but two, nuclear weapons on another country, somehow holds itself as the authority to decide on whom gets possession of those same capabilities."
We are at war???
WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT ASSASSINATING THE TOP GENERAL OF A SOVEREIGN STATE WITH A STRONG MILITARY WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES?????????

"Unfortunately the USA has trump, who can't walk away from a dick measuring contest"
Why did you have to use CNN? I can't click that fake news site.
It's fascinating how Trump supporters call the media fake news but trust and rationalize for a President infamous for lying and undermining the concept of truth as a political strategy (even relative to politicians in general).
It's like rolling around in shit gleefully and then being disgusted by a fart.
Nothing like making assumptions about who I support. Jackass. CNN lies constantly and it's documented. CNN is nothing but a propaganda machine and people like you are blind fools if you still watch it.

I was listening to an American reporter (Mary Louise Kelly) in Iran where they were having demonstrations and the marchers wanted to let her know that the Iranian people are prepared to die for what happened. 
Another common point they were sharing with her was they blamed this on our government and not the American people. I found this interesting and reminded me of Libertarians who are also not fans of our government.
"The president assassinated one of their war heroes, because he ""had plans"" to attack the U.S."
"No shit, he's a general.  The pentagon plans to attack Iran each week, because <em>that's their job</em>.  Iran government doesn't act on the the plans to attack because nobody has escalated the violence -&gt; until the assassination."
"Iran NEEDS plans to defend itself against the US... it's possible that, if this guy hadn't done a proxy war against the US in Iraq the US could be in Iran rightnow (they were going for Iran)."

Come on....we knew this was going to happen ever since Trump moved our Israeli embassy and declared Israeli support for occupying Palestinian land.  We are here for the same reason this all began in the first place with Netenyahus lies after 911...plus Trump exhibiting how desperately he needs the evangelical vote to be re elected as one of the worst Christians on record...but one hell of a panderer.

Nobody was killed.  They hit a plane.  So what?  They saved face and now this can stop.
Who's airbase is it?
Al-Assad is an Iraqi airbase housing US troops.
"So they bombed Iraq, where US soldiers happen to be but have been told to leave(by Iraq).  Seems like if anyone's pissed it should be Iraq."
"The intention was to hit US targets, not Iraqi targets."
Then they under-shot their targets by an entire ocean...
"You’re being entirely disingenuous. US military have operations across the world. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Asad_Airbase"" rel=""nofollow"">Al-Assad Airbase</a> is a jointly operated military installation between Iraqi and American forces. Other coalition forces such as British and Australian armed forces are also housed on site."
"Al-Assad was the 2nd largest military installation utilized by US forces during the Invasion of Iraq. The installation was closed in 2011 after US withdrawal and reopened in 2014 to operate as a coalition HQ in the fight against ISIS, which it is still operating as today."
"President Donald Trump <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-visit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">personally visited</a> the airbase in December 2018 to visit US troops stationed there."

"I mean, what regulations are we even talking about?  I’m fine with a test to determine basic proficiency before graduation.  What further regulation is being proposed?"
"I homeschooled for a little while, teaching myself, before saying “fuck it” and taking a test to graduate when I was 13.  Everyone should have that option.  In my opinion very few people actually NEED ~13 years to learn what they need to learn.  For most people it’s mainly just daycare and busywork until you turn 18.  If you’re the type to be a good student you’ll be fairly well-educated either way.  If you’re the type to be a bad student in a traditional school environment (like me) you might really benefit from alternative options."
"I am not for a lot of regulation, but this is just stupid.  Ensuring most people have a minimal level of education in certain subjects is essential in today’s world.  That being said, any regulation should be very light weight, and only define the minimum requirements."
"Why? Homeschooling creates freako kids with no friends, just like online schooling. Parents are often stressed+busy and can’t do the job right. Yes, we absolutely fucking should."
There’s not enough information to make any determination at this point. The damage indicated in the article would also be caused by the plane fragmenting on impact.
We can hypothesize. Or we could wait till the investigation is complete...
Media: $$ there is waiting?
Warhawks: rah rah rah. I mean. Iran shot it down!
This sub: <em>let us see</em>
This isn't a media outlet. They are an aviation group.
Doesnt matter. The investigation has barely begun. Anything they come to is hypothesized not conclusive.
Hypothesizing is where all the fun is at.

"All I know is Iran's initial statement of an engine fire is incomplete at best. 737's don't usually fall out of the sky because of one engine loss, they are designed for that."
Well accidents happen .Sadly for Boeing their reliability is getting more and more put in question .
The 737 model crashed in iran was one of the most reliable versions.
I m not saying they are unreliable .Just saying that after the cluster fuck of the 737 max this isnt what they needed from a pr standpoint .
"I don't think anyone serious thinks Boeing is responsible here, not unless conclusive evidence points at them. This isnt the max. The plane had a clean record for some time, and an engine failure isnt on Boeing since the plane wouldn't explode into a fireball under Boeing standards. "
That requires someone else to have acted upon it.
"As i said , from a pr standpoint , it s bad ."
Boeing went to shit when they stopped the iron curtain they had between the military and civilian side of the company now everyone gets Chinook quality

"to be fair, when you have 60K poor people invading your country per month, you have to curtail some freedoms or collapse. Im down with limiting some ""freedom"" if people are sneaking into uor home and eating our food and bringing whatever sickness they may have with them. Our country is our home. You cant just break into our home and start eating our food. That act will be met with aggression. And, since we cannot simply beat them and throw them back over the border, we have to do things scientifically."
"""Invading""
""Our country"""
What a deluded person.
"People that come here and work, contributing greatly, to a country that was created through genocide and amassing borders that really are just imaginary lines on a map aren't invading. They are becoming Americans just like everyone else here did.  Assimilation by European immigrants didn't take place for a few generations either. That's how it works."
You have no more right to be here than they do.
They're not eating your food; they're picking it off the vine so you can buy it for pennies.
You have no more right to be here than they do.
"this is insanity.  of course i do.  yes, it's only because of luck, but that's how luck worked out.  are you gonna say that i have just as much of a right as a tall person to be tall? of course not. they were just born luckier.  what a fucking retarded take."
"luck is a garbage way to determine material advantages, and open borders appears to be beneficial to the economy. markets should control the distribution of labour, not luck. your stance is both unethical and detrimental to all countries."
this is insanity. of course i do
The libertarian position is that any peaceful person who wants to be here should be able to.
"i absolutely agree with that position. first, we have to determine who is peaceful and who isn't."
are you gonna say that i have just as much of a right as a tall person to be tall?
You have as much right as a tall person to get things from the top shelf if you build a step stool.
Your analogy sucks because you don't really comprehend the subject.
"Also, ""retarded"" is a bigoted word. It's like the N word. Stop embarrassing yourself."
"Why is retarded bigoted and dumb, stupid, imbecile, and moron aren't? They're all words that were scientific terms for developmentally retarded (as in held back, hindered, slow) and being less mentally capable than the general populace. Now one of them is like the N-word and the rest aren't?"
"Whether or not other terms <em>ought</em> to be considered ableist/problematic, ""retarded"" pretty clearly <strong>is</strong> by a significant number of people. It seems like a strange hill to die on to demand that people not be offended by it."
"Also, ""retarded"" is a bigoted word. It's like the N word. Stop embarrassing yourself."
at least now i know not to take you seriously.  thanks for letting me know not to waste any more time on you.
the N word.
You mean 'nigger?'  You know forcing me to say it in my own head doesn't absolve you.
a country that was created through genocide
Central America was also settled via genocide of the Natives. Lmao what even is this talking point?
"When your argument boils down to ""fuck off this land belongs to our country"", information about how the land was acquired is pretty relevant."
"You are essentially arguing that property rights do not exist, and that people of a country cannot claim ownership of that country."
"But if property rights don't exist, then there are also no rights being violated by keeping illegal aliens out of the land that we consider ours."
"Whereas if property rights do in fact exist, then they should stay the fuck out of our land and only enter legally."
"You are essentially arguing that property rights do not exist, and that people of a country cannot claim ownership of that country."
The fuck are you talking about? Keeping people without the right bit of paper from the government out of the country doesn't protect anyone's property rights.
"If people are allowed to own property then why aren't they allowed to come to a collective agreement to the terms of how they will treat their shared property, ie public property which they agree to not allow foreigners who don't own any part of it to enter?"
"No country is even remotely like a collective agreement, and what would follow from that line of thinking is the exact opposite of libertarianism. It's of course not only immigration that they could collectively agree to deny, every other right could be voted away as well."
"It's of course not only immigration that they could collectively agree to deny, every other right could be voted away as well."
"In order to deny the right to immigrate into our country, one would have to first have the right to immigrate into our country."
"You might believe that all foreigners have the fundamental right to come here, but I do not."
"This brings up a conclusion that I have reached: the ultimate problem with the libertarian doctrine of non-aggression is that individuals disagree over what a <em>right</em> even is. Thus, the only way to solve such disagreement is with force. The person with more force gets to dictate what ""rights"" even are to begin with."
"Yes, the fascist conclusion. But the entire point of libertarianism is of course the opposite, that might don't makes right."
The bulk of the population in Central and South America has a substantial amount of Native heritage (both culturally and genetically); many (perhaps most) are <em>mestizo</em>. This is in stark contrast to the near total replacement of the indigenous peoples who populated the area of the modern US (pre-contact) by people of predominantly non-indigenous backgrounds.
So genocide is okay as long as you take the women of the genocided population as wives and breed with them.
Gotcha.
It takes a strange mind to read my post as an apology for genocide.

when you have 60K poor people invading your country per month ... sneaking into your home and eating your food and bringing whatever sickness they may have with them
Guess you missed this part in the article:
"""A memo outlining the program published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security <strong>said U.S. citizens and permanent residents</strong> holding a “green card” who are detained could be subject to DNA testing"""
Not to mention an extremely xenophobic mindset. Not the most accurate either. “Eating you food” really?
"More like ""picking your food for you""."
"Except this isn't scientific. It means they can ""detain"" you and subvert your constitutionally protected rights. This isn't losing ""a little freedom"" this is a lot."
President Donald Trump’s administration announced last year it would seek to expand its use of biometrics to stop migrant adults from bringing children and falsely posing as parents.
"Phew, glad to hear it's for the children.  What a relief."
What's your proposed solution? Separate children from possible rapist/bad-actors for their protection but potentially separate families or just leave them in a potentially dangerous situation mixed in with adults that may or may not even be related?
This is such a weird premise. How do we know if anyone is with their parents? Maybe we should just DNA test everyone. I really don't know what percentage of minors are traveling with nonfamily members. I doubt the percentage is high. I feel like maybe make a policy of interviewing children in a separate room and telling them if they are in danger they can tell the border agent. Instead of trampling the fourth amendment and creating a DNA database.
"There are global human trafficking rings that have been partially exposed at the highest level, his premise isn’t weird at all."
"Even if it is low, isn’t it worth it for the victims that it did happen to?"
They did a group study of people coming from somalia I believe and the % of parents to children were super low if I remember correctly
That's interesting. I couldn't find anything on this. Do you have a source?
I'll see if I can find it
"It's not a ""weird premise"".  A weird premise would be to assume all minors crossing the border illegally are accompanied by their parents.  With your proposed solution of interviewing they would have to first separate for processing so there would still be cries of child separation.  Why the hell do you think they were separating children in the first place?  It wasn't for shits and giggles. <a href=""https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2018/06/21/documents-human-traffickers-regularly-pose-as-parents-of-children-to-cross-the-border-illegally-n2492737"">Here is a good read presenting the challenges faced</a>"
"Nothing in the article speaks to the magnitude of the issue. I would be surprised if &gt;10% of minor arrivals were with nonparents. This is the same DHS detaining citizens claiming their paperwork is false. I don't really care, let's not destroy the 4th and create state-run DNA databases."
"I agree with you, but to be fair, doesn't the 4th only legally apply to citizens?"
I think it's debated. I don't think the SCOTUS has ever ruled but some lower courts indicate the 4th applies to non-citizens.
​
"<a href=""https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/t-he-constitutional-rights-of-noncitizens/"">https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/t-he-constitutional-rights-of-noncitizens/</a>"

"No, I think all human beings have the exact same rights, and the very concept of a ""citizen"" is unfounded and immoral. I was wondering about the current laws, not the ideal."
"No, the 4th applies for anyone in the US, but is subject to many exceptions (like a warrant is not needed to search incident to arrest, for things in plain view, exigent circumstances, etc.).  Cops can't just kick in doors without a warrant because they think someone that is undocumented is inside.  I am fairly confident this is correct, as a lot of the immigration nonprofits were putting out information about what law enforcement could and couldn't do without a warrant.  One of those was that people did not need to open the door unless a warrant was provided."
"Obviously the 4th has been trampled a bit more regarding borders, and that has extended to everywhere within 100 miles of the border, and there are a couple dozen exceptions to the warrant requirement, so there will be plenty of specific cases that are all over the place."
I'm not claiming DNA is the best least invasive means of determining family members from bad actors but I do see the logic behind it.  Nobody has any viable good solutions for handling children at the border but everybody likes to be outraged by anything they try.
Solution in search of a problem. Government in a nutshell.
"Yeah. In general, I would like border patrol and homeland security to have as little power possible. If local law enforcement has trafficking cases to investigate, let them do it. Assuming people are lying and documents are faked seems like a way to grab power."
"These people crossed the border illegally and it's a ""power grab"" to not trust them all to be telling the truth? Lol"
"CBP has wrongly accused American citizens in the past of entering the country illegally. An 18-year-old born in Texas <a href=""https://apnews.com/82d8d010d0214d3981c2700fa2db3b87"" rel=""nofollow"">was held for more than three weeks</a> last year."
"From the article itself. Let's let judges decide who broke the law and lost their rights, not CBP, one of the most authoritarian arms of the state."
"After you discover a shit-ton of kids are being trafficked, it's best to be skeptical."
"""It's better to think the sun revolves around the Earth"""
How do we know if anyone is with their parents?
Because people coming into this country have documentation verified by another government which says that.
Holy fuck are you actually this retarded?
I feel like maybe make a policy of interviewing children in a separate room and telling them if they are in danger they can tell the border agent.
"So then if the kid says yes, what do you just arrest the parents based on that?  No evidence, just the word of a child?  As if children can't lie or be coerced into lying?"
"Yeah, that's <em>so</em> much more reliable than DNA testing."
Instead of trampling the fourth amendment and creating a DNA database.
"So paternity tests should be illegal, right?"
"As well as cops using DNA to solve crimes?  Since, you know, they kind of have to compare DNA to DNA to do that."
My proposed solution is to not build a DNA database run by the government.
"Whatever we do after that is already an improvement, because the DNA database should not be an option."
"By that logic we should be DNA testing everyone, constantly."
And the most sadly hilarious part:
The most likely person to abuse a child is ...... their own parents and relatives.
"Your logic is pretty illogical to arrive at ""everyone should be DNA tested then""  "
"There is a unique situation at the border where sometimes children are smuggled and not accompanied by actual family members.  How does trying to identify who is family (so they can stay together) and who isn't (so children can be separated for their safety) apply to ""everyone""?  You realize these people chose to cross the border illegally right?"
"Well for one, this law applies to any citizen or non-citizen detained at the border (which includes anyone 100 miles from Mexico, Canada, or a US coastline), so no, this law doesn't necessarily apply to people crossing a border illegally."
I went back and looked and you are correct this 
"gives the United States Attorney General the authority 
to “collect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested, facing charges, or convicted"
Do you know how does this differ from what they are currently already authorized to collect (like fingerprints) if you are arrested for other crimes?
I don't. I'm just terrified of the government getting more and more aggressive about taking and storing identifying data.
Perfectly reasonable position.  We also need a realistic method of preventing kids from being taken advantage of or trafficked at the border.
"If you think the Trump administration gives a shit about these kids, you are a fucking idiot"
It's amazing to me to see how dense you fucking Redcaps are. Swallow every lie whole
"Oh yeah you're right they were probably just separating children as a PR move or to stick it to the ""Brown man"" amiright?"
"Except you are setting up a dangerous precedent. The same logic you are using here "" THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" can be used for legal border crossings as well, most human traffickers move kids legally. Then we can start DNA testing pretty much at any time. How do we know that the parents are truly parents?"
"And you have not addressed the whole: ""parents are usually the abusers"" angle either. So you are doing something that actually does nothing except creates more dangerous precedents and expenses."
Why is that situation unique to the border? Children are kidnapped and smuggled domestically too.
And they are detained with their smugglers for processing?
Or maybe it's just not something to get involved in.
If their honest objective was to protect children this would happen in conjunction with the prosecution of people like ghislaine and transparent investigations into how epstein didnt kill himself willingly.
"It is a strong excuse but I doubt it is genuine, they see an ""alternative"" value that will be pursued illegally."
"Hope no one has step-parents, or was adopted."
"The only way to tell if someone is your parent, truly, is with DNA testing. As someone who is mixed race, people on the regular think I'm dating my mom whenever we go out to eat, as they cannot tell I'm the son."
"That would be fine if it were a voluntary program where a DNA comparison would be done and then families reunited, but that's not what's going on.  Instead they're taking people's DNA, logging it in a massive FBI database, and refusal could result in a misdemeaner.  That's not for the children, that's for data collection and usage against people."
"It is a voluntary program. No non-citizen has to cross our border, especially unlawfully."
"That's not how voluntary works, but that's a great way of thinking about things from an authoritarian position.  ""Well if you didn't want to be fucked over you shouldn't have broken the law, whatever it may have been, just or not."""
"Or just born into the ""wrong"" geography, at least we haven't been installing murderous dictators and training their brutal intelligence/enforcement agencies throughout the region /s"
Let's say the government passed a law stating any theft would be met with the death penalty. Would you then consider a starving man who steals bread to have volunteered himself for the death penalty?
"Watchu on about, no citizen has to cross the border. Jobs, family, travel, business."
"I’d be interested to hear your ideas about the concept of compulsion. Your employer has never compelled you to do anything. Neither has your business, and neither has your family. They might be important considerations, and you might feel like you have to accommodate those demands, but it’s always been your choice."
"Me personally, nothing. But we have Alaska, we have territory we need to cross canada to get to. I get that family and jobs are technically not required, but few people would say that visiting family, or crossing the border for a job, if a citizen, should open you up to possible DNA swabs."
Guess he's never heard of adoption....
Or having a step-parent.
If you adopt a child and make it cross the border illegaly perhaps you aren’t that qualified to have that child pardon my bad english hello from argentina
Most of these people are fleeing violence. I would argue that staying is the worst choice.
And i would argue that the fact that there is violence and that you are fleeing it doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want there are still ways to leave legally
"You do know the US basically shut down the legal entry process. They stop letting these people, most of whom are legal asylum seekers, in to apply. "
What's more this is a very minor issue. The number of illegal immigrants entering the country has been falling for decades. 
Don't believe the propaganda.
No they don't know that
Yeah with a decade wait...
Whose to say the border peeps will accept an adoption form face value?
Is it really particularly surprising that parents save up forever just to pay to get their kids the chance to come to the States for a better life but cant afford it for themselves?
"The ""DNA Identification Act of 1994"" was signed into law by Bill Clinton."
What about it?
The law existed before Trump.
"Am I missing something, what does swabbing detained individuals 14 and older do to address child trafficking?"
It confirms whether the adult with them is actually a parent. If it's not a parent there's a higher probability of nasty stuff occurring.
And then they decide to store the DNA results in a (probably insufficiently secure) database and use it for reasons other than the one stated.
I don't think we can even agree on what's sufficiently secure as a society. Of course it's never perfectly secure and many employees can access the data
"If everyone knew how horribly insecure the entire internet and private networks were, they might be a little more cautious about storing sensitive data."
"Yeah, we need to get rid of ""ID numbers"" that can be written down and copied. Use chip smart cards AKA challenge response always. And don't put copyable numbers on the smart card, which is what credit card companies do today."
"SSN, payment IDs, all this stuff should be replaced with a physical card. That needs to be present at time of use."
"DNA data is going to solve a ridiculous number of human problems. They say the data isn't stored, but even if it was I can't see an issue with it beyond a sense of privacy violations that I truly can't see being applicable to people who can simply choose to not come here"
a sense of privacy violations that I truly can't see being applicable to people who can simply choose to not come here
Except that:
many individuals are fleeing persecution and war and do not have much of a choice
They can choose to stay and improve their own homes.
Not saying that's what they should do. I think we should welcome them with open arms and give them the opportunity to become members of our society with little caveats of cultural history.
False. Only 14% of people have valid asylum claims. 
They are economic migrants.
and pursuing liveable economic status is not grounds for giving up one’s liberty and right to privacy.
They dont have to come if they don't want it. Just like an sport stadium can do a cavity search on you to enter.
In the future they want to falsify the data to fit streamline deportation proceedings would be my guess.
"""How could so and so be living here for 20 years when their dna ""matches"" an individual from our database we started in 2020?"""
"Remember the fbi has been doing it for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-matches-in-nearly-all-criminal-trials-for-decades/2015/04/18/39c8d8c6-e515-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">decades,</a>"
"""Of 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory’s microscopic hair comparison unit, <strong>26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed so far</strong>, according to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Innocence Project, which are assisting the government with the country’s largest post-conviction review of questioned forensic evidence."
"The cases include those of 32 defendants sentenced to death. Of those, <strong>14 have been executed or died in prison</strong>, the groups said under an agreement with the government to release results after the review of the first 200 convictions"""
That only works if you swab children under the age of 14 as well.
We should only be concerned of child 14-16 trafficking.
Why? 26% of children trafficked are 0-8 years old
We prefer to call those 'adoptions.'
"Ted Nugent, is that you?"
I was joking
Any swabbing at all is a step in the right direction.
It also doesn't work if the child was say legally adopted.
Well if they were adopted from Iran they'll be swabbed for other reasons
I... disagree
"Alright. Why do you disagree? I admit I'm a bit single minded on the preventing trafficking angle. If you have another perspective, that might be helpful."
How about a 4th amendment don't let the state create a DNA database perspective?
the constitution protects citizens
That's your opinion? Precedent would say otherwise. 
"<a href=""https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/t-he-constitutional-rights-of-noncitizens/"">https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/t-he-constitutional-rights-of-noncitizens/</a>"
"So a cop can beat you up and lock you away indefinitely without telling anyone, and when you complain about your rights being taken away he can say ""I don't see any proof you're a citizen.""  Brilliant."
Unfortunately those protections are only as good as the people administering / enforcing them.
This applies to citizens as well with in hundred miles of a border no? If you are detained. Doesn't matter if citizen or not. At least that's my understanding so far
It protects citizens and anyone in the United States. Not that it's followed or anything.
So doing a DNA test is creating a database now?
"Well, I guess no court can ever order a paternity test again.  Like, ever.  Since, you know, that's literally what this is."
Did you even think through that before you typed it out?
"The information would go into a massive criminal database run by the FBI, where it would be held indefinitely."
It's the second sentence of the article.
So DNA testing for crimes should be illegal now?
"I guess in rape cases, testing the rapist's semen would be ""a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights"" since, if he's found guilty, that would go into a database."
"Tell me, does this also apply to murder cases?  If someone's DNA is all over the scene of the murder, are the cops not allowed to test it because they'd ""violate the Fourth Amendment rights"" of the murderer?"
And how about fingerprints?  Those are just as unique as DNA.  Should cops not be allowed to record fingerprints anymore?  Should they just wipe the fingerprints off of whatever evidence they're handling and just <em>hope</em> they can still get the guy?
"When you break the law, certain rights are temporarily taken away, some permanently. The 4th amendment is one of those rights that gets temporarily taken away"
Does being detained mean you committed a crime or youre suspected of committing a crime? Are we allowing arresting officials to be the judge and jury now?
"When you are arrested, which these people are. Not detained, but arrested, they can take your finger prints, blood, saliva, or all of the above if a judge says they can. The law was changed to affect only people entering this country illegally. Not American Citizens."
"CBP has wrongly accused American citizens in the past of entering the country illegally. An 18-year-old born in Texas <a href=""https://apnews.com/82d8d010d0214d3981c2700fa2db3b87"">was held for more than three weeks</a> last year. "
"From the article itself. Let's let judges decide who broke the law and lost their rights, not CBP, one of the most authoritarian arms of the state."
From the article:
"The others in the vehicle with him were all Latinos, including his 17-year-old brother Marlon, who was born in Mexico and was in the U.S. illegally."
"If you are in a car that gets pulled over and one of your passengers is committing a crime, you are going to get in trouble too. "
"Not that it is an excuse, but shit happens. You don't tear down the whole system because of one off situations."
The constitution applies to citizens. Not trespassers.
That's your opinion? Precedent would say otherwise.

But they aren't swabbing the children to cross check the DNA.
What if the child was adopted?
"If the child was adopted through some legitimate legal process the ""parent"" would presumably have some form of documentation that can be verified. Until that verification it is an ""acquired"" child."
"You are right. We should take this a step further and put in checkpoints all over the place to check people's papers and do DNA tests. After all, there are a lot of trafficking victims all the states not just at the border."
If it's not a parent
And if it’s a grandparent/aunt/uncle/cousin/adult sibling?
Then the DNA would show that they are related...
Would it? What if they check maternal mitochondrial DNA and youre a paternal uncle/aunt?
"My mom was adopted, my grandfather was adopted, my uncle was adopted. That shit wouldn't fly depending in who they are trying to check"
"Ill also add, people cheat. People lie to spouses. Plenty of kids have differing fathers than what they are led to believe. Even unknowingly so by the mother."
Its weird that people are down voting the hole in their logic.
What if they check maternal mitochondrial DNA
well it's a good thing that's not the test that would be employed in this scenario for this very reason
I dont see any info on the dna tests on the link or the memo it cites. What dna test are they using? 
From what the memo says it looks like theyre just recording dna. I don't see anything about matching it with the people youre accompanying.
It says the results will be submitted to the FBI's database.
So it's the usual genomic sequencing of 20 specific loci on your chromosomes.
"So its for the database where they check to see if that DNA matches any other crime scenes, and not familial relations, right?"
They're not mutually exclusive.  The testing is being done to determine familial relations.  It is then being uploaded to CODIS
Makes sure none of old Jeffrey's goons do not pick up 15 year olds for sex and stuff.
One of old Jeffrey's goons is running this program and separating kids from their families.
"From what I can gather, these are two separate initiatives that everyone is conflating."
"There is a rapid DNA test that is done at the border to determine familial relations.  This DNA information is not shared or stored.  There is a separate initiative to swab anyone detained by CBP and ""subject to fingerprinting"" and submit their DNA to the FBI's national database. The latter is the program that is only to be performed on detainees aged 14 and older."

"<a href=""/r/aBoringDystopia"">r/aBoringDystopia</a>"
The DNA Collection Act was passed in 1994.
"I could care less if illegals have their DNA collected, as criminals already have their DNA  collected. Doing so helps identify them if they  commit a crime, again. "
"<strong>However</strong>, any plans on expanding to collect ordinary citizens' DNA is the real problem, as there are no pure hearted incentives to do so. "
The only way this can be fought against is by claiming that DNA is private information and should not be required to be collected without investigation.
Best comment so far.
"Question. If the government hosts someone DNA, and that information is hacked and used in some way that would cause harm to the individual, can the government be help responsible? For negligence or anything like that?"
"I do not know how/why someone would do that, but I suppose the government should receive penalties for failing to protect this information. "
"Hell, if any service loses someone's data to hackers, the business can be sued <strong>(to my imagination)</strong>"
"So if we start collecting DNA data on detainees, regardless of citizenship, would the government be able to be held responsible for leaks and damage caused?"
FUCK THIS ADMINISTRATION
This administration had nothing to do with a law made in 1994.

And it will be added to the same database as all the 23anMe and Ancestry DNA.
What could go wrong?
The US government won't stop until everyone who is not a billionaire or part of the billionaire's family are in a DNA database.
Nice move.
"You do not want your DNA in any government DB, ever.  Even with next-gen sequencing we still don't have a 100% reliable way of identifying a match.  And most labs use a manual process for testing and inventory.  And all labs are paid for convictions, not acquittals."
(Former employee for a big DNA company who worked on their forensics project).
I am so glad I don't live in the USA
Don't commit a crime and you won't get a free 23andMe.
Being detained isn’t the same as committing a crime.
Maybe people at the border shouldn’t be lying then
How's that Kiwi taste?
"But...they committed a crime. You can’t cross the border illegally, it’s...illegal. We already collect DNA from criminals who are citizens and store it, regardless of what crime they committed. I fail to see how this is different."
"No, being detained is not remotely equivalent to committing a crime."
"So... As an American I'm wondering if I can claim asylum somewhere else? Can I just leave? Will anyone else have me? I'll be a model citizen, I promise."
Maybe I can get adopted by someone.
"Go, nobody is stopping you"
"thank god, then when they rape children and commit murders we can identify them easier."
"Oh. So every person in America should have their biometric data in the FBI’s database? Or just immigrants, because you’re racist?"
"If you choose either one of those, get off <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a>"
"What the fuck are you doing in <a href=""/r/Libertarian"">r/Libertarian</a>?"
"Well my understanding is that libertarians aren't anti-statist. Like, a libertarian wouldn't necessarily be against having a standing army, would it? 40,000 illegals were detained in a single month, I would classify illegal immigrants as a foreign threat. Therefore, while I wouldn't want the government using biometrics on its own citizens, using them to catalog foreign threats seems perfectly legitimate to me."
"40,000 illegals were detained in a single month, I would classify illegal immigrants as a foreign threat."
"So because they were detained, they're now a foreign threat? Is that what you are saying?"
"That's not what he said. He said 40k were detained for being illegal immigrants, and that he classifies them as a threat. No causality there. He doesn't say being detained means you're a foreign threat."
I see you did the old conservative flipparoo there.  Always got to get a good hate going on.  Gets the blood flowing.
Why do you think illegal immigrants commit those crimes at higher rates than citizens/legal residents?
"because 100% of them broke the law by not immigrating legally, so yes, they do commit crimes at a higher rate. not to mention aside from their initial crime of illegal entry they usually commit crimes at higher rates than of native born citizens,"
"for example, double the rate in Arizona. <a href=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/26/illegals-commit-crimes-double-rate-native-born-stu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/26/illegals-commit-crimes-double-rate-native-born-stu/</a> "

As a libertarian I'm not at all concerned with non citizens conditions entering our country illegally
But it’s also citizens who are detained. You’re a moron.
Or they can just turn around and head south with ALL of their DNA.

The issue is the request has no weight. Neither does the PM. Hes a pro Iranian PM who resigned over anti Iran protests leaving Iraq in a hang since they need either the Kurds or anti Iran faction to sign on for any move. 
"Kurds wont move, anti Iran is happy america is there."
Democracy is fun isnt it?
Well the Pentagon isn't wrong.  Iraq hasn't formally requested the US leave.  The PM needs to sign off on the request and he can't because he's only in a 'caretaker' role due to him resigning his post last month.
Reported it was 3 katyusha rockets and they all missed. Nothing out of the usual though. The reporter who videoed it was smoking and joking with someone else while air raid alarms in the background go off.
Small localized rockets fired at the embassy is fairly normal.
"This out of context post is allowed on this sub?  I cant remember the last time a relevant, quality post was made in this sub.  Keep it."
"Posse comitatus in the US its derived from small governments needing to at times call on citizens of the county to assist. Thats why it was rarely ever used in the east but used often in the midwest. The federal governments abilities to do much in the ""wild west"" was more limited."
Most states don't allow commandering non personal.
"I am studying to be an aircraft mechanic right now, and yes it 100% could go down due to engine failure depending on the type of failure.  However there is almost no way that it would also take out its communication system, and so far there has been no report of the pilot contacting anyone with engine issues and requesting an emergency landing.  With Iran keeping the black box it is more likely a military accident in my opinion"
About as much chance that Epstein killed himself!
I appreciate that we can both laugh in these chaotic times!
100%. The engine failed when it was hit by a missile fired by some asshole who thought the Americans were there.
"But, at least one of their missiles hit something"
Rueters says western Intel says there is no sign of a missile.
Except the wrecked plane
A plane that hit the ground is a wreck? Next you'll tell me that a boat that struck an iceberg sunk!
"Turns out, private companies cannot, in fact, regulate themselves."
The Boeing 737 Max is proof of that.
"Denver police were dispatched to an apartment complex in the city’s southwest, where a 26-year-old man told them he wanted to “off” himself after getting into a fight with his wife and her sister, according to the petition. The man’s wife told investigators he had attempted to strangle her and had brandished a gun during the altercation."
"In conversations with investigators, the man said he was “contemplating doing something bad to myself” and that it was a <strong>“good thing they stopped me because it was not good,”</strong> according to the petition."
The gun owner was grateful that they stopped him from offing himself. Clearly we are living in a tyrannical dystopia. No freedom is greater than the freedom of committing suicide while in a vulnerable state of mind.
The man’s wife told investigators he had attempted to strangle her and had brandished a gun during the altercation.
"The police should've been called regardless due to the assault, red flag or no."
"Yeah, they took a gun from a guy who was beating his wife and treating to kill himself. "
That's a good thing. Context matters.
Would that not have happened in these circumstances even before the law took effect?
"How does it differ from <a href=""/r/austrian_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/austrian_economics</a>?"

"The discussions will be of higher quality in several ways, 1) posts will be properly labeled as to distinguish between ethical and economic topics (the two often get conflated), 2) links that get posted (like long videos or lectures) will require a good description by the poster to give context to it and why it's important for Austrian theory (in the other sub, most videos don't get thoughtful comments because very few if any actually watch the video), and 3) simple signaling and memes are prohibited. Shouting ""end the fed"" doesn't add anything to the conversation if we're discussing Quantitative Easing, for example."
"We will also be adding something akin to ""bad Austrian Economics"" sticky posts each week for people to reference Austrian theory around the internet that's incorrect or misinterpreted, etc. "
Other additions to be added later too.
Do you guys still reject empirical evidence?
"Never did. <a href=""https://mises.org/library/economics-and-knowledge"" rel=""nofollow"">Hayek didn’t</a>"
Only those unfamiliar with Austrian Econ think that. Rothbard isn’t representative of the entire school of thought.

"Austria not Australian. Its an economic school from Europe not a penal colony. Its not really considered a mainsteam economic theory, only bits of are seen as correct."
I’m not aware of anything called Australian Economics
there have been 3 balanced budgets over the past 30 years. Zero of them have happened under Republicans.
"No you see, it only happened because of glorious republican influence. Seriously, this is the justification the morons use."
"The House of Representatives controls the budget, not the President.  And I know for sure at least one of the balanced budgets was in the 90’s when Republicans controlled the house."
"This hasn't been true since 1921, since when the President has been statutorily required to submit a budget to Congress."
Which doesn’t change the constitution and all spending bills most originate in the House.  The president’s budget had been DOA since the first one.
[deleted]
but if you are saying that the budgets passed have ever deviated significantly from the President's submitted budget that's just false
"Yeah, this isn't correct at all, man.  The budget submitted by the WH is regularly thrown out the instant it arrives, if not before.  It doesn't matter what the WH puts in there, Congress passes whatever it likes."
The budgets didn’t deviate?  Please.  Wake up and smell what you are shoveling.
"Whatever you do, make sure to keep double downing and not educate yourself on how the budgeting process actually works in our country!"
I’m all in baby.
"Oh man, now you’re going back and selectively deleting your comments, lol.  Super funny after you talked so much trash about how I needed to educate myself.  I guess you decided to do a little of that yourself, you realized you were wrong, and then you weren’t man enough to follow your own advice.  It went something like “it’s ok to admit you’re wrong”.  The arrogance with which you displayed your ignorance was quite something to behold.   So, yeah, I’m glad I kept doubling down.   Next time you peruse Wikipedia and think about talking trash on Reddit you should remember this."
"My son may ask me to buy him some candy.  Let’s say I agree and buy him candy.  According to you he controls the spending.  Sure, ok."
"I make a terrible metaphor that doesn't really apply the dynamics of the situation, then I claim I won the argument. According to you the way things worked have now changed."
"Educate yourself on how the government actually operates, it has changed since 1789 in a variety of ways."
"Your reading comprehension is suspect.  I never made any claims of victory.  I did imply contempt for your position, but not victory.  And the reason you probably think that’s a terrible metaphor is... you don’t know the difference between a metaphor and an analogy.  But please, continue to tell me how I need more education."
"Trump’s inability to get funding for the border wall shows how wrong you are.  If presidents set the budget and control spending, and congress doesn’t deviate, then why did Trump threaten to shut down the government if congress didn’t approve funding for the wall?  Trump’s main campaign promise and he’s been fighting for money for it, but you say he could just put it in the budget and presto!  It’s almost like you read a page or two of Wikipedia and you think you are some kind of expert."
while this is true the president signs it and has a great deal of influence.
What year was this?
"it would be under Clinton, not sure of the year"
"1998, 1999, 2000.  Bush ran on giving back the surplus as a tax cut."

"Not a fan of Republicans by any means, but I believe this is kind of a gross simplification of how it works."
"okay, from 2016-2018 Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress and the Presidency and put up record deficit numbers. "
"They’re dogshit fiscally, and they’re dogshit socially."
They are fiscal when a Democrat is president. That way any negatives can be pawned off on the Democrat but they can claim the postives.
They are fiscal when a Democrat is president.
Even then they're not fiscally conservative -- they're just obstructionist.  They'd happily pass an unfunded tax cut or an increase to the military budget under a Democrat.
Well you cant jerk off your constituents in manufacturing districts if we arent in perpetual war
Realizing it would be cheaper to just pay them 60k/year to produce nothing than overspend for bloated defense contracts. UBI and cut pentagon funding anyone?
Or they could fix bridges and build a $100B national supergrid to make renewable power cheap up to 50% market penetration.  It's only like 15% of the DOD's annual budget and would be a quantum leap in economic power for the US... but that requires thinking five years ahead.
That would be GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION in our glorious market economy.
"I mean you could do that and ubi, ubi would mean eliminating all current social safety programs and would virtually eliminate all overhead those programs have."
"Agree.  Despite being redistribution, UBI is the most libertarian form of welfare in that it does not expand the size of the government."
YeAH bUT peOPLe WilL StARt BuYIng drUGS.
"Also it gives people the freedom to buy whatever they want with their welfare, rather than what the government has decided is good for them. As shown by the free market, people tend to be better at deciding what they want than the government."
Eww why would you want the government to do it.
Privitaize it and let the free market build infrastructure
"It’s not ideal, but it’s definitely preferable to spending the same amount on war."
"BUT THAT""S COMMIESOCIALISM we cannot have that."
"The US military is the most socialist program we have, but you'll never hear a peep about that from a Republican"
Democrats tax and spend. Republicans borrow and spend.
The entire government fails horribly fiscally. You think democrats give a shit about our national debt? Both parties suck at this. The average American has $38k in personal debt
"The democrats and GOP are beholden to their donors and those donors are the shareholders/owners of the military industrial complex and/or giant financial conglomerates. When the US borrows to pay for war, those folks directly profit. So why would they stop? "
"Owners of Lockheed Martin: ""I will finance your election if you try to pursue military action against so n so"""
"GOP/Dem politican: ""Ok"" "
Politicians support military funding bills so we borrow money to pay Lockheed Martin for weapons.
"Lockheed Martin accepts our funds and builds weapons, the owners of Lockheed Martin pocket several billion a year "
"The more debt we take out, the more they profit. They control the politicians via funding campaigns. There is no mechanism to stop this. We're all getting played by these assholes' cunning and soulless racket. "
"It's all one big brutal machine where you input our tax dollars and mangled human bodies in one end and the machine spits out defense contractor profits on the other end. You and me? We never get that back, our country never gets it back.

"I'd recommend watching ""dark money"" if you haven't.  The story has a decidedly pro-union angle which I'm not really aligned with, but the point is made all the same.

All you have to do is put us on your platform... if you don't, then we'll do it for your competitor instead."
"Where did the money come from?  They aren't legally required to disclose, but it's pretty easy to come up with a list of wealthy actors with a vested interest in the outcomes.  Foreign governments, billionaires, etc."

"Out of curiosity, why are you not a fan of unions? Is is because of the modern US collaborationist and neutered unions got corrupted in the mid to late 20th century or are you against unions as a concept entirely? "
"'Cause radical unions were legit one of the OG libertarian organizational strategies: Using voluntary associations of workers to challenge the authoritarian power of the state and its owners. But of course the state hates anything that threatens its power so the unions in the US had their union leadership purged by the state back during the 50's and 60's and have been ruthlessly attacked since then, with the federal reserve and Reagan landing the coup de grâce"
"I know unions get hated on, and for good reason: the remnants of unions in the US are nowadays at best ineffective and at worst fully corrupt, but this was the result of decades of state interference to weaken the power of one of the few voluntary organizations that could legitimately challenge the state. "
"Think about it, we don't like the state and we don't like the fed, but no one has done more to destroy unions than <a href=""https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/08/paul-volcker-ronald-reagan-fed-shock-inflation-unions/"" rel=""nofollow"">the fed</a> and <a href=""https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america"" rel=""nofollow"">the state.</a> If all of our enemies are united in their hatred of unions then the unions must have been doing something right, maybe worth looking into, right?"
"I am a fan of people having the right to unionize, but I am also a fan of the right for people to not unionize.  Most of the unions I've dealt with in my time have been rife with corruption.  Some states have such strong unions that you are legally required to use union labor.  As a result, we have instances of electricians being paid more than electrical engineers, police officers being paid more than lawyers, etc.  These nepotistic distortions of the market reduce the efficiency of the entire society."
Well at least we can all agree that police unions are fucking awful and shouldn't exist. But then again I think police shouldn't exist so that kinda goes with the territory lol
"Do you have some concept of what should replace police, or is it just whoever in town can afford the biggest guns/security detail is in charge of everyone else?"
Clinton and Obama did very well with defecit spending.
And Clinton was on track to have a surplus then I forgot who was after that.  Probably a socialist.
“Both sides” really falls flat when it’s the Democrats that govern over spending cuts and deficit reductions.
"I'm glad people are catching on to the tactic of ""both sides"" being used almost exclusively to defend Republicans."
Feeding MIC takes both sides...
Yeah we had Obama for 8 years out bombing Bush.
"Bush went with boots on the ground prominently, which is extremely costly stuff too. Obama wanted to avoid that as much as possible, and drone attacks were the new weapon in the arsenal."
"Bush would have used drones had they been so avaliable. See trumps extreme..oh, wait you cant see them he hid the data."
"Yeah at the time I was way more liberal and I was like ""oh wow yeah, using drones are a lot better than troops on the ground"" and now I'm like ""uh actually expanding our middle east war to include 7 countries that we are constantly drone bombing back to the point of having open air slave markets is actually a really fucking bad thing"""
Some of the expansions bushs fault. ISIS in particular comes to mind since he opened the beehive called Iraq.
"Oh of course, Bush fraudulently invading Afghanistan and Iraq and passing the dystopian PATRIOT act makes him far and away the worst in modern history, maybe tied with Reagan. Though if this assassination does end up sparking ww3 Trump would obviously claim the title, but while that's possible, it's not entirely likely thank god."
"I wouldn't call Afghanistan fraudulent. Bush said Osama bin Laden was there, and he was infact there. Its also not like OBL wasnt a legit target."
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_Papers"">they lied to the public from the get go in order to get support</a>"
"Considering the amount of people involved who got filthy fucking rich off of lying, there is literally no better word to describe this than ""fraud"""
and he was infact there
"Was he?  We (supposedly) killed him in Pakistan.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Infinite_Reach"" rel=""nofollow"">We didn't know where he was in 1998</a> when we launched cruise missiles after him, and the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was almost a month after 9/11.  Considering the mountain of later lies about Afghanistan and Iraq, we shouldn't take this at face value.  "
"This of course sets aside how invading and occupying an entire country to facilitate a manhunt might be considered fraud, too."
Was he?
"Yes, LA Times ran an interview with his doctor in 04 I believe. The treatment was 2001. Thats where the ""Bin Laden died of kidney failure"" fuck up neocons rsn came from. French Intel also said he was in Afghan in 05."
"He seems to have moved between Pakistan and Afghan, which makes sense since he couldn't stay put."
Taliban also was training AQ terrorists as well per multiple sources.
"I have no doubt he was in Afghanistan at some point.  But we showed in 1998 that we didn't have flawless intelligence on his location, and if you attacked the biggest military on the planet and then had a month before they invaded, wouldn't you make yourself scarce?"
So you'd be okay with a foreign superpower invading the US because they said a terrorist they're after is hiding here?
"They can certainly try. My opinion holds as much weight as anyone elses. Either they can do it and usa cant stop them, or they cant."
"Thats war. Nobody asks the other guy ""hey brah, wanna war?"""
"Ah, the tried-and-true moral compass that hinges <em>entirely</em> around the phrase, ""might is right"". As long as you're the toughest guy in the room, nothing else should matter."
And out deporting Trump
"Actually, outside of being nice to LGBT folks, Obama was further right than Reagan, but as long as the GOP keeps moving further right and calling dems socialists no one seemed to notice."
His landmark legislation was literally just a federal version of Romney's healthcare plan that's been bounced between conservative think tanks for 40 years. 
But he was black and had a D next to his name which obviously makes him a muslim communist or something.
"""But but it's ok when our side does it..."" is one of the ways it happens..."
Everyone finds money for war. They are all on the take. In one way or another. War is business and they are  keeping the machine rolling. 
"The most recent Conspiracy I’ve heard, is that the leader of Iran wanted that guy killed. And asked America to do it. It allowed the leadership in Iran to increase national sentiment and the US spends more on military. Win win.  Basically a bunch of saber rattling, that will amount to nothing. Well hopefully."
"I agree that there hasn't been a necessary war since the CCCP fell, considering the primary purpose of the state is war in defense of the nation if there's one area where the government should always find money it should be the defense budget."
"I have to agree, war is waste. We have no business fighting wars in shit holes on the other side of the world. I hope this doesn’t escalate"
"The Republican Party deceives people who actually have a lot of libertarian values into voting for politicians that don’t implement those values. This is what’s wrong with the two party system: people aren’t voting for candidates that believe what they believe and are instead voting to keep parties in power, even though those parties don’t behave very differently from each other. Libertarians can only win if we can educate others about this."
Republicans and Democrats both want a huge government and national debt.  It's sad
​
Edit:  Down voted for calling out two parties for their terrible policies.  Welcome to Reddit
But arguing that they are the same is stupid. When not in charge the Republicans yell about the deficit. But when they held all three branches of government for two years they increased the deficit. So Republicans are worse at managing the budget. Also Clinton was on track to have a surplus until that Republican came along.
"Ok, cool.. Democrats want a smaller government.  Let me know when either party accomplishes what you want."
Ok cool who will take more of America's civil liberties Republicans or Democrats?  Remember gays are Americans.
"I'm saying they are both incredibly bad, and you are trying to say one is slightly less bad lol?  Dems want to take guns away.  We can do this all day, both parties are a joke.  But yeah, let's pretend one is slightly less about a bloated government.  That's aiming high."
"Is that why Reagan was super pro gun in California? What about trumps bump stock ban by executive privilege. Man this is why you should never vote Republican only libertarian.

"So really, it's not that surprising that the parties are identical outside of the rhetoric they use and their wedge issues that they blow out of proportion like gun rights and abortions to attempt to brand themselves as opposites to keep us from realizing they are 95% the same."

Yup. Cnn and Fox are two sides of essentially state owned media that keep us fighting eachother instead of banding together to smash the state.

TIL the level of carbon emissions can only vary based on our involvement in a global agreement.
Exactly my point
"Target is 20% for Paris agreement, we still aren't on track to meet that. Oh and America started at the top. Seriously, America total pollution is massive."
"OP has proven that the more agreements we back out of, the lower our carbon emissions go. Let's shred the constitution next and save the planet boys!"
My point is it's meaningless globalist shit we don't need.

The only reason carbon emissions have fallen is because natural gas is becoming so abundant and cheap. The article even points out that nearly the entire decline is attributed to declining usage of coal.
"Therefore, none of the changes are actually attributed to active efforts in reducing emissions. This is also not an example of an industry self-regulating because the primary reason for the shift is natural gas is cheaper than coal."
"We are still behind the curve in terms of reducing our carbon footprint, even though many states and cities are attempting to follow the Paris Accord without direct federal guidance."
We exported all of our pollution overseas.

"”""to the extent possible"""
"I can only speak definitely for myself, but I believe most Libertarians would agree that SOME form of government is needed in the real world simply because there are community concerns to defend. For example, a primarily defensive ""Homeland Security but without the Patriot Act"" military could be significantly smaller than what exists now. Being the military and policing areas thought, Libertarians have a very short list of ""necessary"" or ""essential"" government functions.   "
"For example, I live just outside the city limits. The city taxes property owners for sewers, garbage collection, and fire fighters. The county government, on the other hand, where my house is, does not tax for those things. Instead, we have septic tanks which we maintain individually, we hire our own garbage collection service that comes as often or as rarely as needed, and we voluntary subscribe to a fire service in case of fires.   "
"We have no fewer that there competing garbage collectors who knows that if they get too expensive or don't provide the expected level of service, the customers will go to a competitor. The fire service will not let a non-subsciber's house burn if they are called, but that person will have to pay the actual cost of having them come put it out. If someone wants to open a competing fire service with lower rates but which won't come to non-subscribers, and if they can make a go of it, the good for them.   "
"That's a fine, capitalist way to handle so much of what the government deems ""essential,"" just on a local level. On a state and national level they are even more (and stunningly more expensive) government functions which could be privatised and the corresponding taxes eliminated."
"While eliminating all taxes may be the ideal to strive toward, and the stated goal, we realize as a practical matter there will still need to be some government spending. But the number of things that could be cut (or privatised, or left to the individual) means we won't get around to eliminating the last tax for quite some time."
believe most Libertarians would agree that SOME form of government is needed in the real world simply because there are community concerns to defend
"The libertarian position is that individuals have a right to exclusive use of their labor, that the government exists to consistently enforce individual rights, and that the government is not worth defending or funding if it is engaged in excessive violations of individual rights."
"Being the military and policing areas thought, Libertarians have a very short list of ""necessary"" or ""essential"" government functions"
"The military and police <em>should</em> be funded if taxes are levied upon the unearned income derived from denying others the exclusive use of their labor, such as the ground-rent which land title holders collect through the land-fraction of property lease payments, mortgage interest payments, and asset price gains by claiming private exclusive use over the public domain. The military and police <em>should not</em> be funded if the only source of funding available to them is regressive seizures of labor such as conscription, corvée, and indirect taxes on voluntary exchange."
"While eliminating all taxes may be the ideal to strive toward, and the stated goal"
"The political goal of ethical libertarians is to consistently enforce individual rights, including right to exclusive use of labor. This means we should strive to differentiate between earned income and unearned income, between income from production which respects the rights of others and income from privileges which denies the rights of others, and strive to tax earned income at 0% and unearned income at 100%."
Which of those are necessary exactly?
"The DOD, dep of state, homeland, ACF, DEA (not for weed, drugs like heroin that are purely destructive and not recreational or medically applicable), fish and wildlife, equal employment, FEMA, FBI, census bureau. Not all of these government agencies should be kept in their current state. That is for sure not all of the agency’s that we might need apart of. I’m open to hearing arguments as I’m just getting into the party dynamic and feel of it as a whole."
I don't believe I am speaking out of line when I say that most libertarians do not believe those agencies are necessary.
"I understand, but still how do we pay for that stuff with only volunteers"
"Census is 100% necessary. Census data is necessary for fair redistricting, fair representations, and ensuring public services are being delivered for benefit of greatest number of residents rather than for greatest benefit of lobbyists. Conducting a regular census is more important than having a president."
homeland
Why?
"The ethical libertarian position is that individuals have a right to exclusive use of their labor, that government cannot levy indirect or direct taxes on labor-products gained in a manner which respects the rights of others, and therefore that all taxes must be raised from labor-products gained in a manner denying the rights of others, such as through direct fees on private parties claiming exclusive use of land and ideas and charging for access to the public domain."
"In other words, the ethical libertarian position on taxes is that earned income derived from equally enforceable individual rights should be taxed at 0%, but that unearned income derived from political privileges which cannot be equally enforced should be taxed at 100%. The land-fraction of property lease payments, mortgage loan payments, and asset price gains derived from holding land is unearned income derived from a political privilege which allows the holder to charge others for access to the public domain, so there is certainly a lot of revenue which can be gained from this source."
The Libertarian Party platform is not an authoritative source for learning about libertarian ethics.
"Anyone who advocates for eliminating all taxes isn't a libertarian, they are an anarchist. That's what cutting all taxes would lead to, anarchy. "
People seem to forget that the goverment does a lot to protect our right.
"I gotcha, but that still doesn’t answer my question"
Which question do you want answered? You asked two and they have very different answers.
How to pay for government with mostly volunteer payments like it says on the website
That answer is easy. You can't. The Libertarian party leaders are fools. I've been saying that for a long time. We need to remove all of them and get better people in to lead the party.

Welcome to america
Welcome to Trumps America
"Lmao. We've been at this for a while. Trump has lowered the bar in a lot of ways, but his bombing impoverished brown people in the name of democracy is par for course at this point. Trump sucks fat cock, but lets make sure the things we grill him for are the things that make him worse than our usual presedential shit sandwich."
...... seriously?
"""You're welcome"""
-The dude from Moana
This is old approach. 
When European Empires invaded and took over foreign lands to develop involuntary trade partners they typically used debt as a excuse to justify their military occupation and trade controls.   
So the fact that  Trump has stumbled across this approach in a half-assed effort to justify military presence in countries that never wanted USA bases in them in the first place is no surprise.
"The problem is that the agreements between US and Iraq establish during Bush acknowledge that all non-movable assets built by the US (military bases, etc) are Iraq property...."
I can't imagine any scenario in the history of the world that any reasonable person would accept any agreement post-invasion and military domination as legally binding.
It's like a criminal claiming he isn't a rapist because he held a gun to the head to his victims and had them sign a agreement for sexual assault after he broke into their house.
Anyways; The USA is hemorrhaging money in that area of the world and closing the military bases would pay for itself in short time.  Trump should understand the concept of 'Sunk Cost Fallacy' more then anybody else in government since he was a successful businessman.  So this is why his statements strike me as particularly disingenuous.
"I would expect that some douche-bag like Nancy Pelosi or Ted Cruz to say something like this and mean it, but it's obvious Trump is full of shit on this one."
I like what your saying but successful needs some quotes.
"As long as the US can force ME oil countries to sell their oil in US dollars, the cost of the military presence there will be borne by others that need the US funny money."
China for instance is uppity because stopped recirculating the earned US dollars in the US economy and started buying hard assets all around the world...
"Lao is a pretty cool place with a really tragic recent history.  We (the US) aren't totally hated on anymore by the very friendly people, but we certainly aren't their favorites."
Our only hope in the world for friendly relations is for the rest of the planet to understand that the USA Federal government is NOT representative of the USA population.  That it's out of control and people only go along with it because they are scared and confused from a century of propaganda promoting warfare as a acceptable solution. 
Most people seem to be intelligent enough to understand that as they see how it works in their own country and know that USA is no different.

A brand new home in Iraq.
Solid as Iraq!
"Of course. Saudi Arabia is home, yeah?"
Iran is the new home.
"This may be the dumbest thing he’s said so far. It’s just nonsense. Americans don’t want the troops there. The troops don’t want to be there. Iraq doesn’t want them there. Bulldoze the airbase and leave. Save troop lives, save tax dollars, everyone is happy. But I guess that’s to easy..."
"Yes, yes, oh God yes."
Troops get paid significantly more while over there. Some hate it some love it.
$225 a month isn’t significant.
With it being tax free and family speration pay it turns out to be an extra $1000 a month for some soliders. Additionally they don't have to pay for any living expenses/bills.
That tax-free re-up bonus... looking mighty tasty
Getting your legs blown off for a Camaro is the American Way!
As well as chemical warfare brain damage!
They don’t pay expenses to be there but they still have expenses back home. 
"Also, only half your income is taxed anyways (BAH and BAS aren’t) and they get paid jack shit as it is, so it’s barely any tax savings. Family sep is ~$250 a month on the high end and only the highest ranking people would see a significant benefit from pay being tax free. "
Source: spent 3 months playing war games in Kuwait/Iraq and barely made any extra income while there.
"Its great for people that aren't married or send their spouse to live with their parents for 6 montha, BAH adds up an extra 1k/month at least."
I only know one person that’s been there. $225 a month was what he got.
$1225 is also not a lot. Especially if you're supporting a family
It’s a lot for people who need the money.
"If I need $6k/month to support my family, $1225 is not going to be a lot for me."
It's a hell of a lot more than $0
Is that an enlisted person's only choice? Either be deployed and making $225-$1225 or not be deployed and be unemployed?
The real choice is not enlisting in the first place. Soldiers not having a choice is kind of the point.
Most of the troops I've talked to deployed in the ME said they kinda just hung out at Starbucks all day.
and work out... there's A LOT of working out... got so swole

No don’t you understand? We have to be the police of the world and spend trillions of dollars to keep troops in countries that don’t want us in! It’s the perfect plan
For me his dumbest think will always e his rant about windmills or maybe the lightbulb thing
"Without a doubt. But that doesn’t cost lives and billions of our dollars. But yea, he says a lot of dumb shit."
"I also thought that the troops didn't want to be there until this week. With more conflict on the horizon a few of my younger vet friends are looking to jump back in. Doesn't make sense to me, but what can you do."
This may be the dumbest thing he’s said so far. 
You clearly have not been paying attention the last 3 years.
Bet you'll still be all upset when some massive genocide/ethnic cleansing crimes start happening there though
Isolationism means seeing nasty things on the news all the time
Is that what you think we're doing over there? Stopping genocide? 
Trump sold Saudi nuclear tech. while they're in the middle of ethnically cleansing Yemen. They're our top ally in the region and the main exporter of extremism!
"This is the big one.  It can be 'Murica World Police or ""The third world is barbaric and no one cares"".  We have to pick one and live with the consequences."
Exactly
How well did isolationism and appeasement go for the world in the late 1930s?
Sometimes it's better to nip problems in the bud before they get out of hand and become global crises
This has been a problem there longer than any of us have been alive.
"So its morally acceptable to look the other way to genocide etc because ""that's how it's always been""?!"
We have a moral obligation to not commit genocide. We don’t have a moral obligation to police the world.
I don’t care what happens there. It’s not my problem.
"You don't care about genocide, human rights violations, war crimes or ethnic cleansing?"
What happens there is not my problem.
And whoever said libertarianism is morally bankrupt...
There's a big difference between leaving a country that doesn't want you to be there after 17 years of failed occupation and isolationism.
Bet they wanted the US there when ISIS controlled half the country
Sounds like Iraq's problem. Not the US.
Whomever takes power will still sell oil on international markets.
And?
And that’s it. The Americans will benefit from lower oil prices.
Is that all that matters?
In regards to the Middle East? Yes. 
We need to allow them to decongest the colonial borders setup to induce conflict and strife.
By any means necessary?
By any means necessary?
By means they see fit. Which would probably be significantly less violent than the death and destruction we created there.
You are incredibly sheltered if you believe that to be true 
"Contrary to popular belief, America is not ""the greatest exporter of terrorism on the planet, maaaan!"" And drone striking the odd bastard insurgent is not the same as using chemical weapons as a means of ethnically cleansing your own population"

"I normally don't buy into the whole ""America as colonizer"" trope, but holy shit if a sovereign government asks you to remove your military from their country and you don't...."
This is exactly what we’ve been doing for decades in the region. What makes you only consider this now?
Nobody wants to admit they're the bad guys
"Calling us ""bad guys"" really plays down the death &amp; destruction we've been causing post WW2  .. the US is a terrorist state"
By that rationale every super power and most other countries are terrorist states.
Now you're getting it...
state with military used against other countries not in self defence

"Well, those countries don't claim to be 'the leader of the free world'."
It's not like we randomly came up with that.  There is a reason why all the countries we fought along side of in WW2 (and even some we fought like Japan) said 'hey why don't you strategically place bases throughout our lands' at the end.  There is a reason why the primary victims of WW2 fail to maintain militaries that could protect them from their biggest threat Russia or why most of them never bothered to develop nuclear weapons.
The Soviet Union was a huge influence in third world countries rebelling against European and American colonialism/imperialism.
"Thats a bit much, more like we have corporate idealists than americans."
"I've never been in support of it, however if this resolution is adopted, it will be the first time we've explicitly been asked to leave by a legitimate government. It's also especially egregious since it's a government we created."
"Maybe the whole thing is just a - convoluted, fucked up, disregard for human life - way of finally leaving."
"When the other country eventually attacks the base, we'll use it as justification to invade."
We've been doing it since 1861.
"Well sadly it is time to buy into the America is a colonizer trope because it is just plain simply true. American foreign policy is a cancer for global peace, development and economic growth."
American foreign policy has its issues but it's the only thing keeping far worse players at bay. You would not want a world dominated by the likes of China or Russia. And that is what's coming if America leaves a power vacuum.
"To be fair, it'd still be <em>Saddam's</em> country if not for the USA.  Whether that's good or bad is definitely worth discussing, but it's an important distinction.  It's not functionally different than if the USA handed the Free French govt a bill for port improvements conducted in Vichy France for the Normandy Invasion.  The Free French govt would be in exile or a jail cell if not for the USA, so asking for a token reimbursement is hardly ""colonization""."
"Now it may not be a cost effective idea for the USA (it's a sunk cost fallacy given the ludicrious recurring costs to be in Iraq), but that's different than ""colonialism!!11!"""
Kinda different though considering that the Iraq’s didn’t ask for intervention the US army came to find weapons of mass destruction. They then let the country fall into complete chaos after making sure that the Iraq’s themselves couldn’t prevent it by disbanding the army and the Baathists. The US was never asked to do any of this by anyone and lied about their justification. It’s like if Britain demands that India pay the British army after decolonization
"If your army is in someone's country who don't want you there, that's a military occupation. That's the definition of the terms, this is just a statement of fact."
"Demanding payment for your armed forces to leave someone else's country alone is a tribute demand. Again, definitionally."
What is your preferred term for a nation occupying another by force and extracting tribute from them?
"With the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, the US did bill Kuwait to help pay for US involvement and pay to put out the oil well fires.  But that was the existing government (Monarchy) who existed before Saddam invaded, the government who asked for help and who is back in power today.  Similar to the French situation.  But with Iraq there was no suppressed government asking for help as it was Saddam's Iraq, we didn't go their for the purpose restoring a recently deposed government.  We went their for WMDs and to depose Saddam and his entire government, and replace it with a government of our choosing.  A new government which is now kicking us out."
"To be fair, it'd still be Saddam's country if not for the USA."
"Yea, because ISIS mass behadings sure was a better outcome."
I never made any such claim.  If anything that's an argument in favor of the Iraqi govt keeping the US around because they're too inept to keep homicidal theocrats out of their country.
They will never be competent enough until a natural coalition of interests controls the Iraqi government. That will never happen so long as we intervene and nanny over the country.
"Aka, you're advocating that we literally never leave. So why not just annex the country and call it Imperialism already."
A natural coalition in a region where everyone seems to think it's reasonable to bomb/shoot their neighbors because they're a different sect of the same religion?  Are you going to hold out for third world barbarians inventing cold fusion too?
No. And that was literally my point.
You're essentially advocating for our permanent occupation of Iraq.
"Interesting straw man you have there.  If you read my actual comments you'll note that Iraq's current govt wouldnt be governing jack all if not for the USA, so they are wholely beholden to the USA for their position in the first place.  They're clearly too inept to maintain their own country, so their options are:"
1)  Ask the USA to stay and secure their country for them.
"2)  Ask the USA to leave and pay a token amount for services rendered.  They likely wouldnt be on power long, but hey..it's an option."
"3)  Ask the USA to leave for free.  Ungrateful as heck given that they owe the USA for their position, but it's an option that would likely end in their collapse."
I dont think the USA would benefit from remaining in the country...but the Iraqi govt certainly would.
"The Iraqi government doesn't owe the US jack fucking shit. Agreements regarding military bases were made on the condition that all permanent bases were to become Iraqi property, including costs to build."
"The Iraqi government voted to remove all forgein occupation already, so your ""options"" are moot."
Stop pretending that you're considering the best interests of Iraq. You're clearly not. You don't care.
"Every logical conclusion of your ""preferred Iraqi option"" results in the permanent occupation of Iraq by the US. It's just straight Imperialism. Admit it already."
"The current Iraqi govt would still be in exile were it not for the USA, QED they owe the USA for being in power at all.  It's no different than gaining a position through straight up nepotism."
"Given their inability to secure their own country against roaming bands of sectarian terrorists, any option where the USA leaves would likely result in their country completely collapsing as a cohesive state."
"I dont want the USA in Iraq.  However what options does the Iraqi govt have?  They're trying to govern a collection of homicidal barbarians whose apparent default response to disagreements is to murder everyone who disagrees with them until the last warlord standing wins.  It's not imperialism, it's Iraq bringing in foreign troops to provide security in lieu of the other real world options (Saddam 2.0 or Somalia 2.0)."
"Guantanamo bay exists against Cuba's wishes, their only form of protest is not to accept the lease payments."
They didnt really ask yet. The bill passed was non binding
What does non-binding mean when the vote was 170-0?
"Basically the US has not received a formal request to leave Iraq. 
The bill did not force the PM to request"
"The purpose was to put USA on notice of their displeasure, not to force an immediate withdrawal."
"Part of the complication is like every other ME country, Iraq is heavily factionalized on sectarian lines. It was 170-0 because the Shiites legislators were the only ones to vote at all. The Sunni and Kurd reps boycotted the vote, since obviously in their eyes, the assassination was something either long time coming, or they consider anything opposing Iran a Good Thing (TM)."
"If you decide to stay home during an election because you feel you want to boycott the vote, are the results of the election invalid?"
"Interesting, thanks."
if a sovereign government asks you to remove your military from their country and you don't
That can easily be countered by the fact that the Iraqi government has no legitimacy to begin with.
"So maybe the US army shouldn't be there by libertarian standards, but by the same standards they have no reason to give a shit about anything the Iraqi state says. Their constitution is not a serious guarantee of individual rights and is horribly written, their election system is a joke, they are not even capable of holding the territory they claim it's theirs - when Americans first pulled out, ISIS took over half the country."
So tell me again what makes this government legitimate to the point where you would actually have to listen to them?
​
"Anyway, America has plenty of legitimate reasons to not pull out yet."

"I agree that he wasn't the USA's problem.  He was the Iraqi's problem.  I'm pointing out that the only one who should be butthurt about asking for reimbursement for real estate improvements are American taxpayers.  For the Iraqis, reimbursing for (1) base in exchange for ousting Saddam and provide 19 years of military defense is a bargain they should be overjoyed to be offered."

"They finally did enough digging and found out the locals were dismantling them, and selling the parts for scrap. Then using said scrap to buy more livestock."
"They explained to the locals that the towers would provide communication, radio, cell service. And asked why they kept taking them down. One of the locals told them:"
I don't want a cell phone. I want more livestock.
"Just because we don't understand it, doesn't mean it's wrong."
"I was alluding to it being non-functional without a brutal dictator.  If any given society cant avoid devolving into sectarian violence without a Saddam-esque figure on top, ""inept"" and ""shithole"" come to mind for good reason."
So let them have a saddamesque dictator. They would prefer that to the chaos that ensues in the power vacuum so be it.
If any given society
Here's another problem. It's the same problem Afghanistan has. It's not <em>A</em> society. It's only A society because the borders were drawn by Europeans with no regard for local culture. Ditto Africa.

Someone called this the other day. I wish I could remember where.
Like Mexico is paying for the wall?
I thought the Pentagon sent a letter stating that we were leaving? Most corrupt and incompetent administration in my lifetime.  They are making it up as they go along
"""It was a leaked draft."""
"We should have known so when the letter referenced ""Iraq's sovereignty."" America doesn't recognize the sovereignty of any other nation."
I saw that. Un-fucking-believable
When you are a decisive stable genius you can just make it up as you go along.
"The best part about that is in the day or so since that leaked, every T_D idiot has been talking about how Trump's gotten us out of Iraq."
wtf...
I hope the Troops are prepared for another insurgency. Soldiers are going to die over this
Art.of.the.deal
Does that mean we need to pay them back for the country we done blew up?
I suspect Iraq is more concerned with showing they're not taking sides than whether the US leaves. Whether the US actually leaves is less important than the statement.
"Iraq is very clearly pro-Iran now, with Iraq's Shia government and Shia majority population while Saddam's government was Sunni.  Iraq was pretty much handed to Iran after the invasion.  Not much can be done about it now."
"Haha haha 
Yes, let the imperialism flow through you. Finally some honesty in our empire!"
This reminds me of the time my mother in law bought us this but ugly painting and bedding for our guest room (she liked it but never even asked us if we wanted it) then when she left she told my wife that I owed her 500 bucks for the stuff she bought us.
lmao. I dont think its his decision.
So it's an occupation.
"Sure, because that's what respecting sovereignty means."
"Oh, no, wait, I forgot... we only care about sovereignty when it's ours."
Ofcourse
But didn't the Pentagon already release a statement that they would be pulling out in the coming weeks to abide by the Iraqi Parliament's request?
That was apparently mistakenly sent.  This admin is a clusterfuck.
Let's go ahead and put this one in the L column right next to that wall Mexico ain't paying for.
"I can't help but think of how ironic it must be for contractors he's worked with on real estate projects who tried to use this same play, to get paid for the work they did once the rest of the project fell through, but he ended up suing them to oblivion to get out of paying them."
I would find it endlessly hilarious if Iraq turned around and used his own tactic against him - and sued the shit out of him for not delivering on the promise of 'peace in the middle east' (via the Kushner gambit.)
This is bullshit.
"Trump gives US Syrian bases to Turkey (and Russia) for free, but with Iraq they gotta pay."
"Most of Iraq congress wasnt even present except for polarized members for the non legally binding ""vote"" to send US troops home.  US troops are likely going nowhere."
Most of Iraq congress wasnt even present
Why would this matter?
"Well the current Iraqi congress is roughly analgous to the US Congress right before the Civil War, to give you an idea how contentious things are right now."
"As for the legal reason this matters: They BARELY scraped together a quorum to even have a vote, the vote was boycotted by the Kurd and Sunni representatives."
"If a quorum was attained, why does this matter?"
"""As you all know my terrible terrible opponents have been saying nothing could be done... so negative, so mean... but what did I do? I got the Iraqis in the middle-east to pay us money for our wonderful wonderful airbase! Something Obama couldn't do, and they're still unhappy, so tragic. We're winning in the middle-east, people!"""
This is sadly exactly what is going on. You left out how Hannity will then echo it and the base will eat it up.
Just bomb it on the way out and be done with it.
So Trump supports illegal immigration?  Maybe the Iraqi government should build a wall.
Unless the base was ordered by the Iraqis to be built thee Iraqis have no obligation to pay for it.
So now it's officially a military occupation of an unwilling country.
Place bets on how long before it turns into an annexation?
So now it's officially a military occupation of an unwilling country.
again
USA: We've liberated you! You're welcome!
Iraq: Great! Now leave!
USA: No
Iraq: What?
USA: Pay up fuckwit.
Well the base just got a lot cheaper
"I know this will be unpopular, but have you not seen this before? Do you not understand the concept of ""big ask""? He does this constantly, he already has a win because he doesn't need approval to remove the troops, why not go for this too, even if he gets them to pay 10% it'll be a bigger win."
"Downvote me if you will, but save this and dome back and tell me I was right when it happens."
Just like he got Mexico to pay for the wall.
"I guess it's true what they say, you guys take him literally while we take him seriously."
Feels &gt; Reals for you lot then.
I'd give two options. Both have all troops leaving.

Heartbreaking: The Worst Person You Know Know Just Made a Great Point
A broken clock strikes right twice
"honestly, we should feature Tucker on here way more often. He's one of us."
"One of <em>you</em>, maybe. Not us."
The same Tucker that thinks weed can make someone a mass shooter?
Carlson used to be a fairly prominent and influential libertarian writer so this doesn't surprise me. His turn towards nationalist populism after getting his own show is what soured me on him though.
He left the party because he was soo offended that Jessie Ventura was saying 9/11 was an inside job. I think they pay him very well
"Yup: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesXS7ygY2g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesXS7ygY2g</a>"
"Ironically, it’s probably what’s making him more palatable to others but not to libertarians like us. Other than some fringe commentators on YouTube, Carlson is probably the best known right wing pundit that has actually become more open to the populist critique of capitalism (though he’s far from Bernie or something). If I’m not wrong he even claimed he read Elizabeth Warren’s book and said he agreed with some of her economic views"
"I can relate. I've been a libertarian for a long time, but I've never been an anarchist or anything - just a practical person who wants people to be able to live their lives as they choose and have good lives. It turns out that the world is far more complicated that just the NAP. If your country imports tens of millions of unskilled people that commit crime at a much higher rate, crime goes up, and wages go down. If you start trading with a country with a billion people who work for $1/hour, your country's wages will go down because the supply of cheap labor just skyrocketed. The world is complicated. If your goal is that regular American's wages rise and their neighborhoods are safer, why would you have open borders and lower tariffs than every other country? We want things to be produced in America, and people to be safe."
And importing Leftist voters is just insane if you want the country to maintain the quasi-freedom we still have after 110 years of progressivism.
Nationalist populism is the vast majority of what I see in libertarian enclaves online
"""i am a libertarian but... "" redcaps i call them."
I am a Libertarian but traps aren't gay.
Isn't that just a way to call a normal person a Nazi without sounding like a total fucking nut job?
"Um, while this isn't a bad position for Tucker to take, I note that he completely and totally failed to place blame on Trump for this, instead claiming that it was the 'deep state' and people like Bolton who are responsible.  Did I miss him actually blame Trump for Trump's decision?"
Can’t blame the hand that feeds him . Trump has made all right pundits more rich than they have ever been . Tucker / hannity next contract negotiations are going to be a lot higher than their already record high contracts .
"Tucker is a trust fund kid with ostensibly dozens of millions in family wealth. He does not do this for the money. He does it because he likes to control narratives himself, and has stated as much in the past. He is as close to a definitive version of ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" that is possible without being literal."
"Yea he said many things about how bad the decision to bomb Iran was, but he didn't denounce Trump himself for making the decision. But I don't think he was necessarily if not expclitly saying responsibility was the fault of the Deep State, the way I got that it was more him saying not to trust what they are saying right now about going to war there."
Not much of an indictment of Trump when he can't be bothered to blame the guy for his own actions
"I get it, Tucker has to lackey it up or he'll lose his viewer base. But let's not hold this up as some sort of principled point on his part"
Makes you wonder if he'd blame the deep state if the president had a 'D' next to his name
"He would, but it would have heavy emphasis on blaming the president if that were the case.   "
"But it goes the other way as well. When Trump formalized communications with Taiwan the media just smeared him the same way they did for other stupid things like when they belligerently and misleading edited the fish feeding thing in Japan or the maga vs native american stare down, etc. It was only the better pundits on the left like Fareed Zakaria, or the people at The Intercept who said 'oh yea uh we always supported Taiwan and democracy so this is good actually.'"
"Except Trump didn't normalize relations with Taiwan. We still don't recognize them as an independent country, which is what I believe you were saying."
Wtf. Are you really this stupid? I said one thing and you responded with something else.  
"And even if you didn't misunderstood those particular words, the overall point of the comment seems to have completely flew over your head as well, as this has no bearing on it."
"I despise Tucker Carlson more than any other politician in America, just because he is so authoritarian on so many issues. He is actively pushing for and supporting an even more authoritarian shift in the GOP, a shift represented by nationalist authoritarians like Josh Hawley."
"<em>However</em>, I have to give him credit here. He is only good on one issue, but it is one of the most important issues."
Thanks for agreeing with the video and I think it's worth it because he is the only one I've seen on cable news who was brave enough to say this. 
"On your other thoughts - I also disagree with him on a lot, but he is good on more than just one issue. He has had Glenn Greenwald on his show multiple times and they are on good terms and have thoughtful conversations."
"""these are the people who lied about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in 2002"""
That's actually false. Bush had to set up his own intel operation because he didn't like that the intel community kept telling him that they couldn't find evidence to support the claims of his Administration.
Tucker will change his tune soon enough
"I like how partisanship grants psychic powers, the guy made a great point and took a staunchly libertarian view on this subject. Good for him."
lol he complained about the deep state and wouldn’t even name Trump. He’s attempting to salvage his reputation without losing his job. Fuck him
Trump is the person he was talking about when he said we were blaming the deep state for everything just a week ago. This inability to admit that someone you dislike is absolutely correct is moronic.
So he didn't say his name?
"He's historically been a ""pro-war Freedom Bombs Republican""."
"The heel-turn to ""anti-war Isolationist White Nationalist"" only seems to have happened after he took over from O'Reilly."
When a Jew gets killed
"And promotes a conspiracy theory that people opposed to Trump's foreign policy spied on Trump's campaign. There was a criminal referral and warrants issued. That's not spying. That's conducting an investigation. And if you bother to read the Mueller report, it's pretty damning."
"Tucker has been consistently calling out the military industrial complex for years. I respect that he legitimately apologized for his previous support of the Iraq War, and then has put his money where his mouth is when it comes to all of the new conflicts (Syria, Iran, etc...) Most people who apologized for supporting Iraq War 2 (Bush Jr.'s 2003 invasion) only do it because it's so unpopular now, and they turn around and support the new wars today."
"Many pundits are just shills and say what they need to keep their jobs. However sometimes people actually change their views. I think Tucker Carlson is the latter, he's genuinely converted from a standard conservativatarianism in 2003 to a populist, paleoconservative today."
"He's a paleocon at heart, which means he's anti-war."
"Plenty of people in the media are criticizing Trump's bullshit warmongering.  This isn't special, and you don't get very many points for being horribly wrong on 99 issues but right on 1."
There is nothing brave about Tucker Carlson.  Emulating him in anyway is not a show of bravery.
Ive like Tucker for a long time. And Ive pretty much been ok with Trump until this week.

This is the way our courts are supposed to work.  CNN was in the wrong and now they have to pay.
Its a settlement not a ruling
"True, but the point is that there would be no settlement if not for the courts."
They weren’t in the wrong and this is a settlement not a court ruling against them.
Here is a link to an article from CNN itself that basically admits they were in the wrong and that their reports didnt match the video evidence

Yeah im sure you did buddy but lets go over it one more time shall we?
First theres the video which shows the kid was literally doing nothing but standing there smiling.
Theres the report conducted by a third party that stated:
"""The investigative report was prepared by Greater Cincinnati Investigation, a detective agency retained by a law firm on behalf of the diocese and the school. It said the students never responded to the Black Hebrew Israelites with racist or offensive statements and never chanted ""Build the Wall,"" as some alleged at the time."""
I could go on and on but you get the idea. I don't know why this is the hill you want to die on but ok.
Also
"So thanks for playing, but try again with actual evidence."
What are you a sassy teenage girl? Oh wait thats probably exactly what you are.
"On a side note you haven't presented any evidence supporting your claims or why you think this is a ""nuisance suit"" so maybe when you respond to this try a little bit harder to defend your points your last arguement basically boils down to ""nuh uh your wrong because"". Heres a tip, if your reply is only a sentence then maybe you should try thinking a little harder"
First theres the video which shows the kid was literally doing nothing but standing there smiling.
"Which doesn’t back up your claim that CNN retracted anything, or said that they did anything wrong."
"“The investigative report was prepared by Greater Cincinnati Investigation, a detective agency retained by a law firm on behalf of the diocese and the school. It said the students never responded to the Black Hebrew Israelites with racist or offensive statements and never chanted “Build the Wall,” as some alleged at the time.”"
Not seeing CNN in that at all.
I could go on and on but you get the idea. I don’t know why this is the hill you want to die on but ok.
You pretty clearly can’t because you don’t even have examples here.
On a side note you haven’t presented any evidence supporting your claims
That’s because the burden of proof’s on you bud. You’re the one making the positive claim. It’s not possible to prove a negative.

"Now this is getting interesting, how far can mental gymnastics alone take you? Perhaps you'll try to argue that she doesnt reperesent the company as a whole or maybe just fall back on flat out denial."
Also of your going to keep arguing that the article isnt sufficient evidence that cnn was in the wrong at least go back and look at their original coverage of the incident. I assumed you were already familiar with it since you pretend to know what your talking about. Otherwise you'll end up embarrassing yourself.
commentator
You just undercut your own argument by arguing using an <em>opinion</em> show.
So...
"Edit; also, she’s a right winger. She wrote “Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity”"
This isn’t an argument that helps you in any way.
"So its flat out denial then? Hilarious, also i think you forgot how to use the quote function or maybe you think quoting that one word helps you somehow. She works for cnn, she made false statements before having all the facts it doesnt matter if its an opinion show it reflects poorly on their company. "
This isnt an argument so much as its clear evidence that you are wrong. I dont know why you think this undercuts my argument since your counterargument is one sentence. Remember what we talked about buddy ;) if your argument is only one sentence maybe you need to think a little harder.
"Also you're grasping at straws if you think S. E Cupp is a rightwinger, even if that was true she still works for cnn that doesnt change anything. look at her twitter feed its almost all about criticism of trump and the right wing she also supports gay rights and various other causes that make conservatives puke. Although maybe shes right in comparison to you.
You can try to claim shes a republican (even though that really doesnt support your argument that cnn dindu nuffin) but its pretty clear shes just a sock puppet cnn uses to pretend as if they listen to both sides."

"Who, CNN or the Covington kid (who was misrepresented, at personal expense, in national media, for political agenda)?"

Lol no.
"What, specifically?  Because the courts had already thrown out 40 of the complaints, last I checked"
"Yeah, those were thrown out because the lawyers were grabbing for everything.  I didn't say there wasn't money grabbing going on.  It made big news when they got to re-file one of the cases, because they dropped 2 of items from it."
I can't wait until you watch what Fox news has said about Gretta.
"I don't watch Fox, so I wouldn't know.  If they've done the same thing to Greta, then she has a legitimate case."
They more than “hurt his feelings”.  The kid and his family’s lives were being threatened because of the intentionally false narrative advertised by CNN.
"Police officer shoots you in your home, there may be isolated cases, but there’s certainly a great deal that can be done."
Stop listening to the misinformation stream.
In the real world police are sued frequently for their liabilities and kids who have an opinion should have their individual right to assemble in protest and be free from harassment of others protected by the state (one of the few instances the state should even exist).
The kid and his family’s lives were being threatened <em>because of the intentionally false narrative advertised by CNN.</em>

The article suggests the best way to reduce this would be an expansion of medicare for all and extermination of private insurance.
I completely agree. Certain things should not be trusted to the free market.
"Yes, much better to trust it to government employees."
"I got news for you, humans work both fur the government and private. "
Only difference is private makes more money by finding ways to deny coverage.
The fact that a comment like that is in a Libertarian sub and still got 3 upvotes. Smfh
Single payer means one single standard for filing and paying claims.  You eliminate an enormous amount of bureaucracy by consolidating down to a single uniform standard.
"We could also achieve this by way of regulation - uniform standards for communicating claims, reporting expenses, and evaluating policies - but Libertarians would hate that too."
"The article tries to give the impression that the paperwork costs are due to a free market. It ignores the many hoops which HIPAA imposes on health care providers, which look to me like the cause of most of the complexity."
"HIPAA is supposed to protect people's privacy and data security, which is good, but its requirements are so aggressive that it adds large amounts of unnecessary complexity and hinders communication."
The issue reeks of government bureaucracy and unchallenged regulations. But I also don’t think the free market is fully innocent. I think the health care industry has taken advantage of the regulations and stifled competition. 
"It’s a messy, complex issue that needs fixing. In my opinion, a full-on government take over isn’t the fix. I think government run health care works well in other countries. But when you compare those countries to the US they are very different. I’m not totally against socialized health care where it’s possible; I just don’t think it’s possible in the US."
Edit: grammar
Gee I wonder why they had to make requirements so aggressive?
"Could it be, because private companies refused to take privacy seriously until the government had to step in with a giant stick?"
"It cannot be, private companies NEVER cut corners"
New laws are never in direct reaction to companies actions. /s
The article tries to give the impression that the paperwork costs are due to a free market.
I worked seven years as IT at a Houston-area health care center.  The back office had 40 people dedicated to handling private insurance claims and 5 dedicated to Medicare/Medicaid.
Seems like it is time to introduce some competition by abolishing mandatory licenses and other unnecessary regulations then.
It's actually the clinton billing regulations that saw the biggest skyrocket in admin costs.
Come on... you can’t believe that. The real answer is to have a single payer system so the government can make everything more efficient and cost less 😂
Can't tell if this is serious.
I forget that on the internet I have to put the /s so everyone knows
"Yes, the market can reduce the cost but so can intelligent governing which we are incapable of."
intelligent governing which we are incapable of
There's a huge profit motive in deliberate administrative inefficiency.  Constraining the supply of health care services artificially increases their price.
"Now, I will wait as people cherry pick stats about Canadian healthcare to prove that it is in fact INFERIOR to USA."
Despite as we see here costing less
And Canada having higher life expectancy as well as lower infant mortality. Which are the two best indicators of the quality of healthcare outcomes.
"Yeah, and Americans were able to actually see doctors without a 4 <del>week</del> month wait, unlike in Canada"

I don't think there is a point because of this.
Canada is neoliberal and neoliberal shit bags have been cutting funding to healthcare for decades. 
"Same thing in UK, they intentionally destroy the healthcare system with cuts to give the change to the rich, and say look it doesn't work we better privatise and start charging much more to line the pockets of special interest instead."
The Fraser Institute study that 10% of Canadian doctors responded too?

I look forward to the study you can cite that says Canada has shorter wait times than the US

If the sample is random sure.
Can you provide the sourcing behind this infographic?
The source is the first link I provided.
Again a disingenuous way to frame things. The shortest wait time is always the doctor most people can't afford.

Yes
He promised us all ponies so yea
True free ponies are the bomb
Consider?  Sure.
wouldn't make much sense if they were paid by someone else?
It sounds better to say someone else pays for it.  That's poly sci 101 you libtards
but if someone else really paid for it that would be socialism.  We pay for our own taxes because we're proud Americans.  But also it's better if you call them tariffs instead of taxes
We have no inflation moron. Stop posting bs articles
and he banned bump stocks
"You mean crappy springs that bounce the gun around making it impossible to aim?
Who would use those besides gang members doing a drive by?"
So why ban them then if they only make guns less effective?
"Sure. But conversely, why support them?"
"I mean, why ban arsenic in drinking water?  Who would do that?"
"Because SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. If an adults wants to own a weapons add on, let them."
It’s not the weapon or the bullets being infringed. It’s a crappy mechanism that makes the gun go “rat-rat-rat-rat” with shit aim and zero practical use. 
"I can also tell you that you can’t strap AR-15s to the side of your ATV with bungee cords on the triggers so they fire off rounds every time you bounce.

And yet libertarians are falling over themselves to vote for him or his party.

"One side of warmongers and tyrants. But the other party is, oh god i am about to throw up, are Democrats. I just vomited. The most evil party imaginable."
Both parties are warmongers and tyrants. We've had the same foreign policy since Bush sr.
Remind me of how you morons freaked out when Obama tried to pull troops out and the glee with which you blamed ISIS on Obama? 
"Or did I dream that? Nope, you fuckers yell both sides when your side is indefensible."
I don't know any libertarian that was against Obama bringing troops home.
I work in a multi-national company that does business with China.  I can absolutely guarantee that SOME of our Chinese suppliers have lowered prices to us in order to keep our business.
I can also guarantee that it's still not worth it.
"Cool, so we can all agree that:"
100% of the UAW lobbied tariffs on import cars were paid for by Americans. 
100% of the steel tariffs the steelworkers union paid for were paid by Americans. 
And so on and so forth.  
"Protectionist and punitive tariffs are always ‘paid for’ by Americans.  The goal of them is to drive business away from one group to another.   For punitive tariffs, like those against China, are in response to anti-competitive actions, like currency manipulation and their own tariffs.  Meanwhile those imposed by the UAW and steelworkers are simply to prevent those industries from having to compete fairly, yet somehow liberals support those.  "
Shocking.
I don't know of any Libertarians who say that Chinas retaliatory tariffs are a good idea.
This has to be completely false. In International Trade Law and economics modeling it is almost impossible to get to 100% on anything. That's at least what they taught us in school.  
The <em>benefit</em> or calculated <em>harm</em> should be somewhere close to 50%. I could see it being 75% at the most.
"Eh, disagree. "
"Do you think China is eating those costs, or do you think they’re just passing the cost onto consumers?"
Because I’ll bet you they’re not taking a 25% hit.
I'm starting to learn that most people here have zero knowledge of economics.
"in any situation, no single party bears the complete burden of any intervention. Taxes are passed onto consumers. Tariffs are passed onto both parties. Elasticities determine the burden. It's never 100%."
"Anyways, I'll let the people teach me about how everything I've been taught is wrong."
"Hey, here's an idea.  Try reading the fucking article or underlying studies before posting and perhaps you'll see that some of your objections were noted by the researchers"
"The headline said 'Approximately 100%,' which is not the same as 100%, and also happens to be accurate, because it sure as shit isn't China paying these tariffs"
"Sadly, the underlying study is not available without payment--just a short synopsis."
"<a href=""https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187"">https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.4.187</a>"
Thanks for locating a free copy! (I had just followed the link in the posted article.) 
I have given it a quick read and the study seems sound (disclaimer: I am not an economics PhD though I spent too much time with some of them in my career.) 
I don't see any need to modify my comments elsewhere characterizing these results as short-term effects. The study itself suggests that. In fact I don't have any problem with the study (but note above disclaimer!)-- just with the posted article's implication that the study's findings are particularly significant or alarming.
Put matters if you believed the president when he lied that China was going to pay for it and we would “win” whatever that means.
Email the professors who wrote the study or their assistants and I'm sure they would be happy to send you a copy.  This works like a charm pretty much every time btw

I'm starting to learn that most people here have zero knowledge of economics.
"Pretty rich coming from the ""at least what they taught us in school"" guy.  "
"Apparently school never taught you what the word ""approximately"" means, either."
"I replied to another posting of this same ""news.""  Long-story short: the study appears to covers immediate effects, when existing contracts and prices are presumably fixed.  It also says (according to the synopsis (which is all that you can see without $$) the tariffs are being paid by ""US consumers and <strong>importers.</strong>"" In the sort run, that's probably true, but ""importers"" are US or foreign trading companies, or big US distributors or retailers--not consumers.  So we don't know whether those importers were able to pass on all/part/none of the extra ""tax"" to consumers or not. "
Main thing is that this is all necessarily about short-run effects since the tariffs have only been in place a short time.
"Ah, yes, all those companies out there probably wanted to support our president and just ate those costs. Makes sense"
"Read some economics. Doesn't matter whether they wanted to support the President or not: the market dictates whether they can pass on the extra cost or not. If they have competitors then the choice is eat some/all of the increase or lose customers. Given the likelihood that the tariffs will not be around long, losing customers may cost more than eating some extra tariff cost for a while."
"Lol, I know all about tariffs. The cost of tariffs always goes onto the consumer as they do nothing but subsidize unnecessary high paying salaries or kill competition in industry. Like at some steel mill up north that should be closed anyway. Trump doesn't look at tariffs in those terms though, he only wants to see the jobs side. ""See!!! Look at those steel mills! Still up and running!!!! Thanks to my tariffs, ahem, jobs plan!!!"""
Lol
"Reality doesn't match what you were taught in Econ class. Why, it must be <em>reality</em> that's wrong!"
That is even what they teach you on econ class. In an econ class they teach you that <em>it depends</em>.
So what?  The point of tariffs is to make them more expensive in your home country to either hurt the source country in loss of sales or to encourage the buying of other countries' products or domestic products.
That's how tariffs work.  Not sure what all the sturm and drang is about.
A large portion of the US population seems to be under the impression that foreigners are paying these taxes.
Who's fault is that?
"Oh I dunno, maybe Trump, who constantly lies and says that China are the ones paying the tariffs?"
"And his base is too fucking dumb to even really know what a tariff is, so they eat that shit up"
Just taking a page from the Democrat playbook.  Y'all always get so wound up when republicans play by the rules set down by democrats.  It gives me the gigglefits.
Turns out the orange man is just another crooked politician. Can you imagine people really thought he'd be different?
"In some ways he definitely has been for instance hes probably going to be the only president in history that has rolled back the administrative state, which is honestly enough for me."
"Oh nice, ""the administrative state""
please, for the class, define this propaganda term."
It's not a propaganda term jackass
"The Administrative State is Dwight Waldo's classic public administration text based on a dissertation written at Yale. Here Waldo argues that democratic states are underpinned by professional and political bureaucracies and that scientific management and efficiency is not the core idea of government bureaucracy, but rather it is service to the public. <strong>The work has contributed to the structure and theory of government bureaucracies the world over and is one of the defining works of public administration and political science written in the last 75 years</strong>."

"You know, theres a public library somewhere near you.  Maybe you should pop in and read a book every once in  while."

So buy US products when you're from the US.
A) you don’t escape higher prices that way
B) you destroy comparative advantage. Making yourself and everyone else poorer. Complete self sufficiency (like making everything yourself) is an abject poverty lifestyle and trade barriers are the same lifestyle but by degrees.
Complete self sufficiency (like making everything yourself) is an abject poverty
"lol pull the other one. Poverty, by definition, means inferior in condition to everyone else. Many nations throughout history have made everything they need and not been in an inferior position. Hell a little commune can make everything it needs and be just fine. Unless you have to import your doctors, energy or some other critical component of life, you are not impoverished just because you do it yourself."
Lowers global wealth. This would only work if your aim is to hurt America as much as you are hurting China in the hopes the crumble beyond repair and you can rebuild after.
What is your stance on unions and collective bargaining?
Unions and collective bargaining produce gains for individual groups or industry at the expense of unionized workers from other industry. If all workers unionized and formed collectives there would be little room for gain for any of them. Also unions stifle efficiency and productivity and union reps/leaders are much like the government in that they demand high pay but produce nothing and create zero wealth.
"Well I shall give credit in you keeping your argument consistent. That is not something you see on reddit very often. It showcases where you and I differ however as while I too take exception to some elements of collective bargaining, I understand it has a fit in certain areas. "
"It's true that all economic activity is linked, but ebs and flows in the economy are actually what keep it from becoming stagnant. It's akin to electricity. Electricity doesn't really ""flow"". It pushes. It is the difference in potential on either side that makes it work. An economy is similar because a balance in trade does not allow for growth. "
"But yeah, if it's global wealth vs home team I'm going to go home team. No one else out there is looking out for us."
"Well you would hate my view on borders than. I think of electricity as water in a pipe, so it flows to me (I annoy this has nothing to do with anything)."
"Fuck that economic nationalism, I'll buy the best product at the price point, regardless of where it's from."
sales or to encourage the buying of other countries' products or domestic products.
WTO doesnt permit you to directly tariff only one countries products like that.
"Directly yes, but that is the overall effect.  So, for instance if we slap a tariff on electronics from China, the indirect result is that more Taiwanese or Korean electronics are  likely to be purchased as a result of the lower cost."
"You don't slap tariffs on countries, you slap them on products. We just have (had..?) trade agreements."
"Actually, it depends on whether or not there is a ""most-favored-nation"" relationship between the two countries. "
"Plus, there are other provisions in US (and international trade) law that permit action against, for example, ""unfair trade practices"" (Sec 337 of the Trade Act of 1930, as I recall.)"
Then why did China put tariffs back on our products if they were just being paid for by our consumers? Were their tariffs paid for by their consumers? Aren't higher prices one point of tariffs so consumers stop buying Chinese goods?
Are you guys completely against tariffs? Why?
"Because libertarians are in general in favor of free markets.  In part because, as we’re seeing, government meddling often results in more harm than good."
"Yes, raising prices on goods makes people less likely to buy them.  But in the US it’s hard to find products in many spaces that don’t at least have materials sourced from China.  So the result is that instead of buying a competing product that is 100% domestically made and sourced (extremely rare and expensive in many cases), people just don’t buy the product or pay more for the Chinese product they would have bought anyway."
"So the only result is a tax on consumers, maybe slightly lower sales for China, and domestic manufacturing taking a hit because their materials suddenly cost 25% more."
"Yes, I am 100% against tariffs. "
"Let's say you loved a product that was a big seller for a company that had been around for a long time. And the cost of the item they sold was $100 but you figured out a way to make the exact same product for $75. Would it be fair to consumers, you, your family, your employees if the Govt came in and said, you can't sell yours for $75, it has to be $100 because the other company can't make it for that cheap? Why should the Govt make us pay more for something because the other company either pays people too much, is sloppy, or bloated or all the above? Tariffs only subsidize high wages or bloated, sloppy companies and hurt companies being competitive. "
"They need to either let those companies die or make reforms in this country. Hell, they are even dying with Trump trying to prop their asses up. Don't even get me started on the farmers. Those poor fucks. For all we know, China may really like the prices they get from Brazil on soybeans now. They may like how they do business. You think Brazil isn't going to do everything they can to keep all that new business they got this year?"
Can we agree that the whole government sucks and we need a second revolution for the whole fucking world?
Revolutions that lead to freedom are legitimately rare. All the shitty people who voted for our shitty current situation would still be around to build a new shitty government if the current one were removed.
Yeah but we can't vote to fix our government t anymore. What else can  we do? And it's not like we dont know its corrupt.
When your choices are between taking a flesh wound and keeping going or taking a flesh would and playing Russian roulette with a revolver that has live rounds in 5 of 6 chambers you should skip the Russian roulette. A government with corruption levels as low as ours would be an ideal outcome for any revolution.
The thing is it isn't as low as you think. It isn't as good as you think and all that wack shit about 'global elites ruling us' isn't that far from the truth
We need a complete rebuild on how we vote and choose elected officials. 
"No more gerrymandering
No more electoral college
Ranked choice voting
Change the primary process as well
Vote-by-mail in every state"
These will drastically improve the quality of winners of elections
Yeah but the people in power won't allow a cute like that through. It's so much more corrupt than you think dude. This isn't something you can vote to fix
Revolutionaries are infamously bad at leading nations. The first revolution only worked because they were all established politicians.
"Yeah but like, fuck this place we can't even vote to fix our problems"
"Approximately 100% of democratic,politicians voted Democrat in 2016: report"
Is there a reason captain obvious has to be reported?
Why does this bother you
I am just wondering when Libertarians became cock sockets for liberals?
​
"I thought you were ""independent"" thinkers and didn't get your political opinions shot down your throat from a the end of a Liberal's organ.  "
Go ahead and ban me.  I am not interested in hearing more whining from liberals by a different name.
Libertarianism was founded on opposition to tariffs. That never changed.
"Also, this is <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>, you're allowed to disagree here, it's not an echo chamber like all the pro-trump subs. I suspect you'd get more traction if you disagreed without the petty insults."
100% of welfare for laid off factory workers is paid for by Americans. 
"You globalists got us into this mess, why should we listen to you     now?"
You don't think that there are layoffs once our economy collapses from our isolationism?
Edit: Also worth noting that we pay more for these tariffs than we pay for unemployment (which the tariffs don't really prevent).
This just in: Americans buy shit in America
"Not really news, bub"
The Trump administration has been insisting that we don't pay them. Are you saying that it's not news that they are lying to us and that their supporters are buying those lies?
"Tarriffs are paid by the country imposing them. But costs the country they're being imposed on via lost revenue. When people say that China is ""paying"" for the tariffs,  it's true. But yes, Americans are almost solely paying the tariffs. That's how they work."
"When people say that China is ""paying"" for the tariffs, it's true."
"No, it's not.  Not even a little."
"China is suffering from our tariffs, yes, but they aren't paying them."
"They're paying in lost revenue,  which, in economic terms is an opportunity cost. They are indeed paying."
"As the article says, not really. I'll never understand economic nationalism like this, it's idiotic."
I can’t spend their lost revenue. We are losing revenue too.
"True, but that's literally how they work. We take some pain to inflict it upon someone else. The hope is that we can outlast the other guy, which as the largest economy in the world and the center of the global financial system, we're in a pretty good position to do."
"It doesn't move the US any closer to accomplishing any of its objectives in the Middle East or with Iran specifically, that's all you need to know about whether or not you should support it. "
"Our goal with Iran has been to get it to eliminate its nuclear weapons program and reduce its influence across the Middle East, threats and military action can be part of that but this specific military action has accomplished the exact opposite.  In fact Trump's approach has moved us only further away on these objectives. "
What the US goals in the Middle East are is another discussion but if we're just talking about accomplishing our official policy then Trump is failing in every regard.
"Except Trumps goal is to start a war and ""bomb them back to the stone ages"". This moves us closer to that goal."
"The funny thing is, you actually believe those are, or have ever been, genuine goals of the United States military and intelligence community."
whether or not he was a legitimate target depends on knowledge that we do not have.  There is no question that this was an act of war against Iran.
"It seems to me that there are a couple of important points:<br/>
1) he acted against the pentagon and military advisers<br/>
2) he later stated that he would target ""cultural sites""  i.e. public places and civilians."
"All it’s done is create a multitude of mourners across the region, and mass opposition to the United States. "
"Honestly, Soleimani’s assassination was an act of perfidy by Trump. It was a setup of a decent man just seeking deescalation for his people. I don’t for one second buy that he was responsible for any American deaths or led these so called proxy militias. I wouldn’t be upset if another article of impeachment is filed over this."
Saying Soleimani was JUST seeking deescalation for his people is ignoring reality. 
I agree that this increases the likelihood of war and that measure that do that should typically be avoided. 
But by all measures this guy was not seeking peace in his life as is evident by his own statements about controlling Iranian policy in countries where its proxies are killing hundreds or thousands.
I don’t for one second buy that he was responsible for any American deaths or led these so called proxy militias.
"Back in Iraq during the Sectarian messes (AQI targeting Americans as well as Shiites attempting to turn to democracy, Shiites targeting all Sunnis and eventually Coalition forces), Iran was supplying the Shiite militias - specifically Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Militia and the Badr Corps - with EFPs that are essentially cheap anti-armor IEDs that can spray the inside of an armored vehicle in molten copper."
"Those weapons undeniably came from Iran. They came from the Quds force who were doing the exact same thing with Shiite militias, Hezbollah, and Hamas that we were doing with the original Mujihideen during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan."

Some of us got to drive those roads back in those days. Some times we even found them before they detonated.
The characterization of Soleimani as a decent man. What the actual fuck is wrong with you.
This is just fucking ignorant. Soleimani was a bad dude it's really that simple. What comes next is another story
"Iran is firing missiles at our bases right now, so there'll almost certainly be war, which the GOP will try to use as a pretense to throw out the impeachment without even discussing it"
What a fucking shit fit
Was wrong when Obama did it and its wrong now yeah.
Obama killed government officials of any country? Shit that was never in the news..
Obama blew up a hospital and a wedding. Then said “oops”
Where was the outrage then?
There was plenty of outrage then amongst libertarians... something I’d really expect a Libertarian to know full well.
In countries Congress had authorized military force in... And against targets Congress had approved us to fight.
When did congress okay bombing civilian weddings?
He said “oops”
Congress did authorize the killing of terrorists in Iraq. 
The fact that the terrorist was in the Iranian government doesn’t change that.
They authorized the killing of terrorists associated with 9/11. 
Iran isn’t associated with 9/11.
"But Democrats and Republicans are surely the same? If I continue supporting the crackhead party, I can not be held responsible for the leaders of my country, right?"
"If you vote for them you can absolutely be held responsible. At least in some circumstances, ya."
You know I don’t have an issue when Obama or Trump or any president kills or drone strikes an actual terrorist. Some idiot living in a cave somewhere taking responsibility for bombjng in Embassy or is blowing up ship or whatever. But this was a fucking head of state type individual. This would be equivalent to a iraq killing mad dog Mattis when he was on trumps administration. It’s 100% wrong
"Just as importantly, it was 100% idiotic. He just united most of Iran against the US."
You act like anything changed.
Iran had moderates before Trump started dropping missiles on high officials and tearing up nuclear treaties.
Nowadays it'd be pretty fucking hard to be a moderate.
"Iran has ""moderates"" among the population, not the government."
Because the hardline America haters somehow pulled one over on Obama while cackling and rubbing their hands?
"Well the Iran deal wouldn't have worked out anyway. None of the provisions were permanent so they could simply play the long game, get sanction relief, wait a decade or two for their economy to grow and then just go ahead with a nuke."
"Iran's dictatorship, like Turkeys, is more nuanced than most"
Though I don't know enough to really say it applies in the case of moderates in government
A lot less now...
He just united most of Iran against the US. 
"Doubtful, large portions of Iran, if not the majority, hate their own government."
Not so big a portion anymore...
And you've reached that conclusion from the propaganda videos Iran puts out or what?
Or what.
Or what. 
We've already agreed that people in Iran hate their government. You think those same people will genuinely mourn the death of one of its henchmen?
Try to be logical .
"Lets take the US for example ...how many people do you think want Trump gone ? Considering he lost the popular vote then it s safe to say that at least 50% of the population doesnt like him .  Now let s say China assassinates Trump . Do you think that those 50% who wanted him gone will say ""We cool China we wanted him gone anyway thx for helping "" or will they be more like ""shit now we have an imminent outside threat so our resentment for this administration is put on hold "" ?"
Views within any country are not homogeneous.
Too be fair he’s an actual military target. What’s illegal is the US drone striking countless civilians every month.
"<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/693263/monthly-airstrikes-in-iraq-and-syria/"">https://www.statista.com/statistics/693263/monthly-airstrikes-in-iraq-and-syria/</a>"
That being said it was too much.
Too be fair he’s an actual military target.
He's a fair target <em>after you declare war against that country</em>. But we haven't done that. Congress doesn't want to own another vote on a war in the Middle East.
"That’s fair, I don’t agree with it or anything. I was just pointing out that the US routinely commits illegal acts of war."
"Yes, but the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must."
That's not a prescription for governing. That's Thucydides making a keen observation on human nature through the microcosm of the Peloponnesian War.
"Isn't evil just relative, though? What about the thousands of US statesmen complicit in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of foreign civilians? Hell, what about the citizens who voted those people into power and generally supported such belligerence? Not to mention the other American institutions that have run roughshod over certain populations..."
Fucking retarded post
I applaud your self awareness!
Bro they attacked our embassy. That's our soil.
"Who is ""they"" bro? All reports point to a Shia militia of demonstrators."
Literally anything bad that happens in the world is either the fault of Russia (if you're a Democrat) or Iran (if you're a Republican). Where have you been???
Russia is objectively more active in global destabilisation than Iran.
To compare them is like comparing China's influence to the phillipines

How is a Shia militia of Iraqi demonstrators in Iraq Iran's State military?

"That does nothing to address my previous question. Not only that, it does nothing to contradict my original point in the OP:"
<em>The issue has always been the US carrying out a State sanctioned assassination of ten people on another country's soil against the wishes of that country's government.</em>
"That doesn't hurt his case, it helps his case."
"That was the Iraq protestors, bro. They were protesting in response to The Golden Don having over 20 Iraq soldiers killing in airstrike for the death of a single American contractor, bro. We still haven’t been given any information on the identity of the American contractor, bro. Donald Trump was supposed to be pulling troops from the Middle-East not digging in deeper and threatening sanctions on Iraq for voting to expel US forces."
"Airstrike came after the embassy attacks, bro."
"Israel airstrikes have been going on for months in Iraq territory with US backing, bro. So even if your statement was true it wouldn’t matter as it starts in the middle of these back and forth escalations."
"The ""attack"" on our embassy was maybe 100 people. Previously there had been protests in Iraq that numbered in the thousands against Iran's influence. This attack just drove Iraq into the arms of Iran."
An attack is an attack. One person or 100.
Any point containing the words ‘they’ ‘attacked’ ‘our’ ‘embassy’ as justification for military action doesn’t belong on a libertarian sub.
"Well we're arguing the point of government anyway, so this entire topic shouldn't be on a libertarian sub. Seriously, get over yourself."
Why bother coming on a Libertarian sub and telling someone that’s trying to point out a non libertarian position on a topic to ‘get over thenselves’?
Seems like a waste of your time.
"What a great justification for having the Iraqi pm invite him so that a deescalation can be negotiated before assaninating him, an Iraqi official, and a bunch of other people on Iraqi soil."
Protesting isn't attacking though.
There is no moral or legal equivalence. 
"Soleimani attacked, he has declared war on us. He and his leaders are the aggressors. By taking him out, by decapitating that military, we have offered a low kill solution to a thorny situation.  If they choose to be rational,  they can surrender or de-escalate real and potential attacks. Instant peace."
"We defended ourselves, just like shooting a back alley mugger in the head."
a thorny situation.
Remind me again what that thorny situation is? <em>Why</em> did we kill him?
I have no issue with your position. It’s a fairly standard Republican view.
Why pretend to be libertarian though?
"Not pretending. I know that we in America have an amazing panoply of rights and freedoms. And that there are people like Soloemeni who hate it  If we let people who hate freedom win, eventually we lose our freedoms too."
The price of freedom is vigilance.  The tree of liberty must occasionally be watered with blood.
"Man, this is some idiotic shit.  Really stupid."
"You're no libertarian at all, bub.  Now fuck off back to your circle-jerk, lackey"
There is no moral or legal equivalence.
"Soleimani attacked, he has declared war on us. He and his leaders are the aggressors. By taking him out, by decapitating that military, we have offered a low kill solution to a thorny situation. If they choose to be rational, they can surrender or de-escalate real and potential attacks. Instant peace."
Did you not read my post at all? Because your rational is exactly what I pointed out is NOT the issue from a libertarian perspective.
"<strong>The issue among libertarians has never been about Soleimani's character or whether he was a ""bad guy""...</strong>"
<em>The issue has always been the US carrying out a State sanctioned assassination of ten people on another country's soil against the wishes of that country's government.</em>
"We defended ourselves, just like shooting a back alley mugger in the head."
"Defended ourselves from what? I want to know exactly, specifically what aggression this supposed act of ""self-defense"" was in reference to."
"When, where, and how did Soleimani attack the United States?"
"Soleimani was a uniformed general in a conflict zone, engaged in hostilities against the United States and its interests."
"<a href=""/u/harumph"" rel=""nofollow"">/u/harumph</a>, at what point does it become okay for Soleimani to be a legitimate target?"
Baghdad airport was a combat zone? Did anyone alert the millions of civilian planes that landed there..
"Yes, Iraq is indeed a combat zone. The total land area of Iraq has been designated a combat zone by the Unites States for many years."
Where’s the evidence he was actively engaged in hostilities? Don’t believe everything you hear.
"The United States government has stated it was Iran-backed proxy militias behind the rocket attack that killed a US contractor, and the storming of the US embassy last week. These proxy militias <em>were</em> commanded by Soleimani."
"How exactly have you been sold on the Iranian propaganda that Soleimani wasn’t such a bad guy, and not directly involved with these proxy militias across the region?"
How exactly have you been sold on fighting Israel’s war for them? These are all post-hoc justifications presented without evidence.
"Do you have any evidence that the US intelligence stating Iran’s involvement is false, outside of Iran’s public statements?"
"Do you have any evidence that the US intelligence services are telling the truth that doesn’t rely on your baseless belief in them? They lied about Iraq, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Bolivia, Russia, etc. but this time they’re telling the truth about Iran? Why should I believe them this time?"
Sure. Decades of precedent demonstrating that US intelligence routinely lies about goings on in the Middle East to justify perpetual war.
When it doesn’t cost us trillions more dollars and thousands more lives by starting another war.
Iraqi PM said he was there on a diplomatic mission regarding Saudi Arabia.
The Iraqi PM is resigning over Iraqi pressure because of Iran’s explicit influence over him. You can save this Iranian propaganda horseshit for someone else.
"Now you're just making shit up. The Iraqi pm resigned months ago, he's the caretaker pm until parliament decides who they want to replace him."
"Yeah, you’re a great example of how informed the average response within this post is. Laughable. "
The current caretaker PM is still the PM that caused massive protests because of Iran’s influence over him. He has not yet stepped down from his position.
Suppose Iraq had deemed one of the US generals a terrorist. A drone  strike was issued by Iraq's government which destroyed a transport at  Washington Dulles International Airport assassinating the general and  nine other military officials with the US government having no prior  knowledge of the attack. 
This is fallacious as it assumes the US government and the Iraqi government have equal legitimacy as government entities.
"They do not. (I would argue the Iraqi government has no legitimacy, their election system, their constitution, their laws, all of it is a joke. They do not even have the capacity to hold their own territory.)"
So America gets to decide on the legitimacy of other countries leadership?
Super libertarian position you got there.
Super libertarian position you got there. 
"There is no pure libertarian position to take here, this is not an ideal world."
You either recognize the legitimacy of a pseudo-democracy like Iraq's government or you don't. Both positions are anti-libertarian by very wide margins.
So America gets to decide on the legitimacy of other countries leadership? 
It's a fairly objective test here.
"Does the Iraqi constitution enshrine individual rights? No, it doesn't. Every ""right"" can be defined however the law says plus it's a theocracy."
"Does the government have the capacity to defend and hold its own territory? No, it doesn't. So in this regard, it is more impotent as a government than even Saddam's government."
"Now from an American/NATO point of view, ISIS conquered half of Iraq and then used that as a platform to stage attacks on various countries around the world, including NATO countries. So even from a purely self-defensive position where you only intervene when attacked, the US is justified to reoccupy Iraq, stay there and ignore whatever the official government has to say."
A simple ‘yes’ would have sufficed.
"An ""objective"" test?"
"A sole country deciding for the world which leaders are, and are not, ""legitimate"" leaders is nowhere close to ""objective""."
Reddit is a for-profit corporation with a board of directors that makes money through ad-revenue and marketing. Free speech will always take a back seat to making money in any similarly structured for-profit corporation.
Yes but the more and more they restrict/ban/curate they become more like a publisher and are then responsible for all content.
Are we still repeating this lie?
"They can curate all they want, they will still not be responsible for the content. "
"<a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a> hot with the tired and old conservative talking points"
"They can curate all they want, they will still not be responsible for the content."
No they can’t. 
In order to afford the protections of being deemed a platform you need to not be a publisher and let people use your platform more or less unrestricted save for posting illegal things and such.
"The more and more social media starts to filter off thoughts and ideas it doesn’t like, it is acting more like a publisher. And as CNN learned yesterday publishers are liable for the content on their sites. "
"If reddit says we allow this post, not that o e and say this view is ok that one is not then they are actively picking and choosing what gets displayed on their site. That is publishing. "
Platforms are like Verizon. They let anyone use their service and as such if someone plans a crime over their phone network Verizon is held as a co conspirator because they have protections as a platform. 
"It isn’t a conservative talking point. It’s common sense. Either allow free speech and be a platform, or curate content and be a publisher and held liable."
Except that's not how the law works and you know it and you just spend a paragraph of stringing pointless sentences together.
That is exactly how it works which is why there is talk of them being regulated. 
Sure it is a grey area as to how much curating exactly means you are no longer a platform but many people would agree that big social media sites are approaching that limit. 
"<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-platform-publisher-lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-platform-publisher-lawsuit</a>"
"No, there is talk of them being regulated because they have not bowed their head to the conservatives, so they are looking for excuses to get their shit pushed through. We have had this topic be brought multiple times here and it gets debunked every time. At the end of the day freedom of speech only applies to government not punishing you for your speech. "
"Also, imagine the Pandora's box you are opening, all platforms curate the material on them. At the very least to make sure that there is no blatant pornographic material. You would subject every platform to regulation. A hot take on <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>"
Except it isnt . Did you bother to read your article ? Facebook claimed to be a publisher in order to justify cutting data access to apps it didn't want and the ruling that went in facebook s favor still keep them clear from the censorship claims .
Now what some people don realize by wanting to frame reddit as a publisher and holding reddit at those standards means fact checking and harsher content filtration because of the liability they would engage on everything posted on their platform . So again ...be careful what you wish for .
Wait  a sec ... Isn t reddit for profit ?
""" Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. "" Did reddit claim to be a   ""free speech"" platform ? "
You are basically saying that they cater to the majority of their customers ...shocker! ... are we really on a libertarian sub ?
"Have you seen the libertarian sub? Reddit's business model, and what it sells itself as, are no longer even slightly congruent."
"It doesnt matter what a product or service <em>claims</em> to be. It's what the consumers of that platform percieve it to be, what built it's consumer base."
"To even call reddit a news or information agrregator is a joke. To call the discussion here ""grassroots"" is laughable, "
"Deflating critiques of the platform with ""it's a buisness"" is dismissive and obtuse."
How it s called and what it really is doesnt matter ... It s marketing . 
"""It doesnt matter what a product or service claims to be. It's what the consumers of that platform percieve it to be, what built it's consumer base.""
Exactly , and right now customers have a good perception of reddit considering their traffic ."
"""Deflating critiques of the platform with ""it's a buisness"" is dismissive and obtuse.""  I m not deflating , i m just pointing out that a business catering to the masses is to be expected .  If 80% of reddit users dont want to see   the other 20% of reddit users opinion it s only natural to push away the 20% to please the 80% . Doing otherwise would be stupid on a business standpoint ."
"This is the cocacola defense, the alex jones defense, fox news and now the rachel maddow defense."
"""nobody could be dumb enough to think that just beause we sell a product called ""vitamin water"" or ""news"" that that is actually what we are selling"""
"It does not mean that doing so isn't cynical, nihilistic greed at the expense of it's own consumer's well being."
"Reddit never claimed to be a news site . Its a social news website ...meaning user posted stories . Reddit doesn t provide any stories , the users do ...reddit is just the platform .  Now how the platform works and what can be posed or not is up to them .The therms of use arent  hidden .Every one who decides to use the website implicitly agrees to them ."
"So the ""alex jones defense"" doesnt apply here because simply put Reddit doesnt post stories ."
""" at the expense of it's own consumer's well being."" The consumers seam happy considering the traffic ."
Doesn't mean this place aint a fucking joke in the real world.
"Interesting you went with alex jones, when coke did it before and was first on the list."

"You're dealing with a private business. You do not have a right to have your stuff prominently listed, or even accepted at all."
You’re conflating “free speech” (the ability to speak freely from state coercion) with private misrepresentation.
"That definition is trash when monopolies and oligopolies exist, while the government sits on its hands because they are ""private companies"". Our ""rights"" only exist at the behest of private corporations and a maliciously limp-dick government who refuses to protect our rights."
Definitions shouldn’t be changed because they don’t fit your conditional preference.
"Your revised definition is a misconstrued version of “rights”.  What you mean to get at is the problem with monopolies, as well as the distinction that’s being debated regarding publisher, content-provider, and how society handles the responsibilities of each."
"And “limp government” isn’t the problem (there’s plenty of power in the state), it’s <em>limp government officials</em> that’s the issue.  Which is a systematic function of incentives that lead to “regulatory capture”.   Systemic/structural change is the only fix."
Edit for clarity.
Ironically you’re on a libertarian sub complaining about private business’ freedom to craft their property as they see fit.
Would I have to go out of my way to see the opinions that the majority disagrees with?
Literally yes lol. Why the fuck do you expect to have your niche beliefs handed to you on a platter?
Why the fuck do you expect to have your niche beliefs handed to you on a platter?
this sub and others are the very counter examples.
"IF this was a ""free speech"" platform, would I have to go out of my way to see the opinions that the majority disagrees with?"
Yes. Absolutely yes.
"Have you ever heard the phrase ""marketplace of ideas""? When something shitty comes onto the market, what happens? Few people want to buy it, so few places stock it."
"""If this were a free market, why do I have to go out of my way to find my Juicero refill bags!?"""
Isn’t PornHub like that? One can see all the thumbs up and thumbs down votes (I have heard). What you describe would be useful. One could separate comments that are more unanimous versus more polarizing. You mentioned needed to search for contrarian opinions. That is not my experience. Most Libertarian threads typically break down about 60-40 one side or the other.
(I have heard)
"yeah, I heard of that website too ;-)"
"There is nothing wrong about private companies not having free speech. In fact, when liberals decry “harmful speech” one of the ways that more egregious things aren’t publicized is through private companies not showing them."
"Companies are 100% players in the marketplace of ideas. If you believe something stupid and radical, you have every right to say it, but no company is obligated to give you a platform when most of their audience will reject it."
The right to speak freely isn’t a right to be heard.
Reddit is hardly a free speech platform. The reminders to only down vote based on comment quality rather than opinion are absurd given how they are overtly ignored.
"If you need an example of how this platform works head over to <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> and disagree with a socialist remark.  You'll be down voted into oblivion which in most forums means that you can only respond to comments once in 10 minutes.  In that time your comment will be buried and you'll have no meaningful chance to defend or clarify your position. "
They are of course free to operate this way but their public perception and the image they work to project are not aligned with this reality.
You can also learn to just be a smart ass by reading Das Capital and Of Grammatology and then you can say your deviant opinion with impunity by using their preferred vocabulary.
Best two books for learning how to Reddit without getting banned
"I have read Das Kapital and The Communist Manifesto and I still think they are retarded. Das Kapital has a point to calculate your time with your labor value, but it also does not give a person who ponied up all of the tools and ""capital"" in the first place a return on investment for taking up risk."
"It also tells people the ""ideal society"" with no concrete steps or stucture to get there."
"So morons just say ""lets give a centralized authority ultimate power and purge dissenters to reach this utopia"""
MFW shit's bullshit.
"Not only that but a lot of subs like <a href=""/r/offmychest"" rel=""nofollow"">r/offmychest</a> will just permanently ban you for comments or posts that don’t really violate their rules but the mods I guess just didn’t like.

"Yeah, maybe they were downvoted, it depends on what the context was. Like gun rights, until Trump said ""due process later"" I think he was given the benefit of the doubt on standard GOP gun rights."
So if a GOP person says something libertarian we post it here and hit gets upvotes? It's the exact same thing on the left. There's posts from Tulsi and I think even Warren here that do well. That post was anti-Trump by the way.
"No, I meant the pro-Trump grift was upvoted, not this particular Ron Paul video. And yes, that post was Anti-Trump but had a lot of people talking about their experiences with pro-Trump pretend-Libertarians."
"You can't really be a ""pro-Trump"" libertarian I agree, but you can make an argument that he's better than the alternative"
"I mean it’s trump or healthcare for all, voting rights for inmates, open borders and many other crazy socialist policies that I don’t want implemented"
"inmates vote in Canada, we haven't fallen apart yet? Maybe that reflects more of a problem in the USA, calling itself free but has a huge inmate population from the illegitimate war on drugs. "
"You pro War on drugs locking people up to take away their voting rights, Nixon?"
I agree that the war on drugs has been a failure of the highest order. We’ve pumped billions into solving it and still opium addiction is at an all time high.
"Alright, we can agree on that at least. I don't think Free College or Public Healthcare are anything but the government providing an equal playingfield, but we can agree to disagree on that. "
"Like you said, it's not a salad bar, Democrats come with gun control and other things that make it a package deal."
"It’s not like a make your salad on policies here in the US. Most of these overblown budget policies are widely agreed upon the Democratic Party. Free college, the green new deal. The dems want to stick the government’s nose into every part of the market and puppeteer it like Venezuela. I just can’t get on board with that"
That's literally the best way to describe it.
"It's like watching the playoffs when you don't even like sports, and by watching it you're reminded of exactly why you don't like sports."
More like we are in the d league.
But somehow you have more information. Maybe it's like watching professional tetherball and your the only one who seems to realize there is a rope.
It’s just that government has become about the teams when it’s original purpose was to be a referee

Is it because he lies all the time?  I bet it's because he lies all the time.
Same could be said about basically all politicians.
Everybody lies. Most people don't lie about easily verifiable facts or lie when there is no reason to. Trump does both and often.
"He lies a bit more though.
Compulsively."
"Take the average amount of lying a politician does, and multiply it by about 100."
Why I don't trust Trump on anything:

"Team MAGA went from ""end the endless wars, leave Syria"" to ""John Bolton is my co-pilot"" in a staggering amount of time. I thought this was supposed to be the anti-war team."
They are team Trump and Trump has no firm stance on anything
Yet another example of politicians lying to win elections.
Trump was the only one that had a solid track record of speaking out against wars.
Now that Trump has exposed himself as a war monger then same people that condemned him for his anti-war stance now condemn him for his pro-war stance.
It's all a farce.  They are all full of shit.  They are all liars.

<strong>War Is A Racket</strong> 
WAR is a racket. It always has been.  
"It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.  "
"A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ""inside"" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes."

"The $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades-old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial $400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets Jan. 17, the same day Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners."
"The money that Iran received was (1) part of an international and legal deal, and (2) already belonged to the Iranian state, but it was in frozen accounts. You keep acting, though, as if the Obama administration gave funds to Iran because it actually supports Islamic terrorism, which is the insinuation you're trying to make here without due cause."
The claim by above poster was that cash was put on pallets and sent to Iran. 
"From the article.  "" An initial $400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets Jan. 17"""
It appears to be true.
I'm guessing OP meant pallets of U.S. taxpayer cash because something something Obama is a dirty Moslem.
"Prolly he meant that. Is there where I should go, something something moving goalposts ?"
What?
"This ""largest state sponsor of terrorism"" is such bullshit."
"Where is the proof they are sponsoring ""terrorism""?"
"Yes, it is quite clear that trump won't abide by international treaties."
Cause he took all the money himself and gave Putin and the Saudi’s much more.
"No, he'll be delivering caskets with flags draped over them to American families."
USA! USA! USA!
I’m voting for that blondes tits
That’s true but lord know most people aren’t willing to work for it.
"Check that...everyone likes more of THEIR own money in their pocket.  I like money, but taking money from someone's hard work isn't something I like to do...but some people give no fucks about it"
That's true..what of it?
So we need to pay for another pointless fucking war with our tax money and lives until the next Republican is elected.
"If only we could have seen it coming when electing this petulant fuck. But nope, Hillary bad."
I'm sure Hillary was behind this!
Have you ever seen her and the ayatollah in the same room at the same time?
Reminder this happened after Iraq voted for US forces to be expelled. Trump and the Pentagon scoffed at the Iraq vote and made it clear they wouldn’t be leaving. Trump and his supporters can’t make a self-defense argument for their blood-thirst and any further escalations.
Was going to say this. They told the US to withdraw troops <em>after</em> killing a popular Iranian general. What were they expecting?
"These attacks are nothing new. They were shooting rockets at the embassy in Iraq fairly regularly last year, it's just that now it's politically convenient to talk about it. "
Source: I was part of a unit that was stationed at the Embassy last year.
Missiles and rockets are VERY different.
"Short of very high end missiles that Iran doesn't have access to, the difference doesn't matter to our missile defense systems. None of this is trying to pass judgement on the ethics or wisdom of current events, I'm just pointing out that attacks against US forces in the region have been ongoing for some time and so the fact that they're reporting on it NOW smacks of political convenience."
"Pretty much the same thing, a propelled projectile. Pretty sure you couldnt tell the difference if it hit your house."
I can build a rocket in my garage. I could not build a missile.
I could not build a missile.
Not with that attitude.

"A keyword is “unsubstantiated.” The key topic is “Iran.” Everything I wrote is in regard to those two things. Let’s also not pretend that warmongering is a partisan issue, that only shows your bias and the notion is ridiculous. Hillary Clinton is a prime example and almost became the president."
"Yeah Hillary Clinton was a huge warhawk. If she were elected president she'd probably be stupid enough to assassinate a high-ranking member of a foreign government after being told to do so from her Democratic cabinet. I bet she'd also be stupid enough to justify the assassination retroactively on the basis that the government official was plotting to kill Americans within several days without a shred of evidence to support her claim. Damn, she's such a warmongerer, she probably would have threatened to blow up Iranian cultural sites thereby committing war crimes. "
Good thing Trump and the GOP are nothing like that.
Let’s also not pretend that warmongering is a partisan issue
It absolutely is. Only a fool would pretend that the two major parties are anywhere near equivalent on this issue
Sheesh
Hillary Clinton is a prime example and almost became the president. 
"Are you fucking kidding me, or what"
"In no universe was Clinton as much of a <em>war hawk</em> as the average Republican, let alone the actual Hawks in their party"
Double sheesh
They both have had people that incline towards warmongering. The burden is on you to prove that Republicans and their conservative constituents as a whole are “warmongering.” 
"I say it’s an unsubstantiated narrative because no one I have seen is willing to prove it. They just claim “it is.” It’s certainly not unreasonable to ask for substance. If you don’t have anything, then I can only conclude it is a false narrative that makes it easier to make issues like these extremely partisan and biased. "
I have yet to see a libertarian take on the whole topic. “Soleimani was assassinated and Trump’s the aggressor!” Except that was precipitated with an attack on our embassy and a number of small conflicts before. We finally do something and suddenly “the US is an aggressor!”

"Which killed nobody and hurt us in no way whatsoever.  Our embassies get attacked <em>regularly.</em> The proper response isn't to assassinate people touch off a war because of it, and in the past, we've shown proper restraint in the face of Petty and wasted efforts against us."
"As for the rest: I have no burden here whatsoever, because the concept that <em>Conservatives and Republicans</em> are anything but a warmongering party is absolutely fucking ridiculous, and every single person here knows it, including your mendacious ass"

"It wasn’t an assassination by our current legal definition. Otherwise, we have already done a lot of illegal assassinations no one cares about. They intended to destroy our embassy and kill everyone inside and that was the last straw after a history of transgressions on their part. You have no rationality here, instead positing your opinions on us like they’re facts. "

Trolls don’t belong here either. 
Ad hominem = troll response. You still haven’t offered any substance to any of your arguments. 
"It was not an assassination because the drone strike was a direct response to Soleimani’s history of belligerence and his plans to continue his attacks. It was legally appropriate in the context of minor conflicts the president is allowed to address as commander in chief. Not to mention, I believe that the full justification for the drone strike has not been released by his administration, if I remember correctly."
It absolutely is. Only a fool would pretend that the two major parties are anywhere near equivalent on this issue

I think you missed this. It’s worth reading and all the tweets below.
I think you missed my point because those are completely unrelated to it.
"Oh, I did. Thought you wrote “Nuclear deal” both times. My mistake. "
Anything Trump did was in retaliation to Iran’s transgressions. Iran getting worse is water getting wet. Obama giving money to terrorists and such tarnishes my opinion of him when it comes to foreign policy.
concern troll
Let’s take a step back. 
unsubstantiated narrative that Republicans or Conservatives are blood-thirsty war hawks.
The first thing you do is mention Trump and Obama. We both have our own perspectives on this issue but you didn’t actually address what I was saying. Are all Republicans and their conservative constituents warmongering? 
concern troll
"I’m actually unfamiliar with that term, but I’ll ignore it if you want for the sake of honest discussion."
"Right now, in real time, you can investigate which party consists of war hawks and which party really wants to avoid bloodshed. Just head on over to <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a> (where the democrats congregate) and then to <a href=""/r/conservative"">r/conservative</a> (where the republicans congregate). Compare the top comments on this very trending event and report back with your findings. "
I’ll wait.
"The echo chamber that is Reddit is never viable as a news source or a place for test groups. <a href=""/r/conservatives"" rel=""nofollow"">r/conservatives</a> will say it’s retaliation to Iran and <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> will say it’s retaliation to the US. There is no substance ever offered (so far to my eyes) by anyone that claims a whole political party is warmongering. There is no merit to the narrative. "
Find an outside source. I’ll wait.
Nah. I’m standing by those sources because people commenting on Reddit political subs (for all parties) are generally better informed than the rest of the general population. Even people I disagree with are better at discussing issues than  people on Facebook or God forbid the comments sections on news sites.
"Social media is a bad news source period. There is no merit to the narrative unless you can cite a creditable article or direct source that indicates the whole party is warmongering. Most blokes on Reddit, like most blokes in real life, are not that well informed or especially intelligent in these matters. Reddit is a place to see the most popular ideas submitted to the site. It’s not conducive to propagating the truth at all."
I'm waiting for Trumpsters to apologize for supporting that airstrike because it would make Iran too afraid to act out
Any dead?
None so far. 
14 missiles. 4 failed iirc. Makes you think if US knew about this and evacuated its people before the attack. :) and why would they in this case do this?
Edit: i am still looking for a reliable source
Unsubstantiated? Democrats and Republicans have been acceding authority to the executive branch for decades and with few exceptions their only quibble with Trump is they would have handled it differently not that they wouldn’t have done the same thing. There is no principled opposition from them to this.
What do Democrats have to do with what the Republicans are doing
Nothing. We really need a president that will finally stand up to the military-industrial complex. Sick of constant US imperialism.

"I think I'm tired of seeing the ""what is your opinion on Yang"" posts spammed every week by YangGang trolls."
But shilling for Hornberger and your sub is totally AOK
At least Hornberger is an actual Libertarian with cred
"Yang is a fine fellow, but not attractive to a Libertarian as his policies are mostly statist and authoritarian in nature"
"I don't disagree, it's just pretty funny coming from the guy promoting an actual sub in his flair"
"Libertarians should vote for the Libertarian Party. And I don't try to cover up that I'm promoting Hornberger, just look at my flair. Compare that to OP who is active in the Yang subreddit, but trying to act all innocent with the 1,423rd ""what do you think of Yang"" post"
I mean how's he hiding it if his post history is public?
Is it the shilling or the specific candidate being shilled for?
"Wouldn't you say there's a difference between promoting Donald Trump and promoting the Libertarian Party on a libertarian subreddit? There's nothing wrong with promoting candidates, they just shouldn't be statist pieces of shit like Trump or Yang"
Oh yeah there's definitely a difference. But shilling of any kind for any candidate is extremely annoying.
"Perhaps, but if we want the Libertarian Party to do well this year then some sort activity on reddit is necessary. A necessary evil perhaps, but still necessary."
Shilling is shilling. There is no mandatory requirement that libertarians support your canditate or party.
"Of course not. But if you agree with Andrew Yang more than you agree with the Libertarian Party, chances are you're not a libertarian."

"Wanna like him, then gun control.
And that was already pushing it after his socialized program."
Andrew Yang is a socialist totalitarian
This is an interesting take since Yang wants to use the government to direct incentives for the free market rather than using the government as a hammer to smash compliance and control everything. I’m curious how you can reconcile that.
direct incentives for the free market rather than using the government as a hammer to smash compliance and control everything.

He's probably the least bad Democrat available. 
"That isn't saying much, tho."
I’d argue a case for Bernie as a libertarian option. Yes he’s a socialist and into big government but he’s probably the biggest on expanding personal freedoms.
My personal freedom to trade stocks is infringed upon by his proposed tax. Just an example.
"Acting like economic freedoms are somehow not personal is stupid. Why would you single out one issue like that? ""Economic freedom"" is no less personal than ""sexual freedom"", ""firearm freedom"" or ""drug freedom""."
You're a high-frequency stock trader?
"The tax proposed is for any stock trade (in the US). And even if it wasn't, what if I am a high frequency stock trader? Is that not my right?"
but he’s probably the biggest on expanding personal freedoms.
He isnt that far left socially.... Hes economically left.
I’d argue a case for Bernie as a libertarian option. 
"Interesting, let's see where this goes..."
Yes he’s a socialist and into big government  
"So then, not a libertarian option"
but he’s probably the biggest on expanding personal freedoms. 
"Excluding the freedom from big government; the freedom to not have my wealth redistributed for free college, MFA, expanded SS, and other entitlements; the freedom for doctors to practice medicine free from MFA restrictions; and the freedom for employers to hire and fire as they see fit, among many many others.  In other words, not a libertarian option."
"The only agreement I have with Sanders' policies is immigration.  He's getting harassed over his gun control policies by the other Dems, so I don't know how much I can really support him on that anymore."
Im comparing him to other dems. I don’t think you’ll find many if any libertarian options in the bunch. I’m just saying he’s the one of the better options among the dems.

"He still has support for ""Value-Added Tax"" on the issues section of his website, which is just a regressive national sales tax, so he is one of the least libertarian candidates running, and should be strongly opposed by anyone who believes ethically that individuals have a right to the exclusive use of their labor."

You don’t have an unlimited right to speech. I fail to see the issue. It’s even a unanimous court ruling that led to the clear and present danger doctrine.
The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.[6]
"Are you under the impression that free speech should be completely unlimited including espionage, libel, threats, conspiracy of crimes, etc?"
"Handing out flyers against the draft is ""espionage, libel, threats, conspiracy of crimes""?"
The supreme Court effectively ruled that the 1st amendment isn't unlimited and deferred to the judgement of the lower courts that doing that violates the espionage act
"The lower courts ruling was retarded, but the supreme Court ruled correctly that the first isn't and fundamentally couldn't be unlimited and the espionage act is legal. As shitty as it is"

"When you are the ""opposition"" party during difficult times, especially with war and terrorist attacks. Arguing against something is impossible. It was a trick Hitler used to secure ""special powers"". "
"But it is possible and it relies on being smart about your vocabulary. Saying ""Trump shouldn't have killed him, and we should find peace with Iran"" sounds like you support Iran in this conflict. Saying ""A dangerous and evil organiser of multiple attacks against American troops had been neutralised, but now we should be securing our allies in the region instead of pushing escalations further"" is a more diplomatic response"
"That diplomatic responses sounds as if you're supporting the President's decision to kill him which would be dishonest and stupid since that's been a major escalation.  You can't say ""now we should not escalate further"" if you're just going to support the President's escalations after the fact."
Any sane person 100% supports the president's decision to kill him. The strike was done with 0 civilian casualties. 
We now stop provoking Iran and completely ignore their threats to escalation. 
"If we came out and said "" after analysing the risk we have decided Iran is not a capable threat so will be focusing on restoring Iraq's democracy and providing support for our allies in the region"" it would hurt Iran more than any rockets"
Only trump worshippers support that decision.

this is no surprise coming from someone who supports the unelected bureaucrat state. These people have an authoritarian vision for the US.
Doomberg's thoughts on Chinese democracy was the subject of a long (gasp!) Washington Post article last week
"Fucking, what? Do you have a source for this?"

"The more billionaires China creates, the more communist it becomes"
"Unfortunately you're wrong. He's not an idiot; he's a wicked smart, and evil, manipulative bastard."

Yeah not nearly embarrassing enough either.

media attention
The media &amp; rich telling us plebs what policies we should believe is nothing new
"I haven’t seen any other presidential candidate advertise on YouTube as much as Bloomberg. Even with all the advertising that he can generate from his massive wealth, he has so little support."
Reallly? For some reason I get a bernie sanders ad on every single video I watch. 
"""Hi, I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you please add your name to say you support our campaign?""  "
That's where you can then hit the skip ad button. It's getting to the point where I might just turn adblocker back on for youtube.

Never let this right stomping bigot forget those things.
Isnt that the definition of American Politics tho?
It's the definition of authoritarian politics at minimum.
The pro gun control part kinda precludes the liberal title.
"Hey I'm a classical liberal, but that's generally not what we're talking about when we hear liberal."
This is why definitions are handy to look at: 
(in a political context) favoring maximum individual liberty in political and social reform
"Gun control advocates are not liberals, they are authoritarians even if they call themselves something different."
"Kind of like how the North Korean call themselves a Democratic Republic, but are really just a concentration camp waste land? Or you mean like the the National Socialist German Workers Party were actually a bunch of hateful anti-Semites? Or kind of how like the People's Republic of China is actually a collection of hundreds of well bribed self serving individuals who represent the will of their party and not their people? Or kind of like the United Kingdom isn't all that united with one out of four kingdoms ready to leave? Or kind of like how conservatives who want a small government, actually just want a big government run by the military? Or kind how like the Ku Klux Klan isn't even made of related people and therefore more like the Ku Klub Klub?"
One of the worst moments of depression for me as a kid was realizing that just saying you are the opposite of your actions is enough for most humans to completely buy it and defend you. We should still be climbing trees ffs.

"article says ""watch this video""... nothing there"
Notice how Beto was ex-communicated and Bloomberg continues to poll in the single digits... The majority of liberals aren't as anti-2A as some want you to believe.  
"Dude doesn't have a chance in hell. And while he is SUPER anti-gun and I'm not really here to defend him - this ""quote""  in the headline is taken out of context for effect. SHOCKING!  The article quotes him as saying “We just do not want the average American carrying a gun <strong>in a crowded place….”</strong>  Not exactly a distinction without a difference. "
"Again - Bloomberg is a clown, wants to take your guns and doesn't stand a chance - but shitty, editorialized drivel is still shitty, editorialized drivel."
The headline says “watch” but I didn’t see any video on the webpage. I’m on mobile so could be it didn’t load.
Truth isnt important whats important is the narrative
"It’s a gun grabbers article, from a pro 2A site. "
"Clicks and ads, doesn’t matter how. The idiots lap it up."
Beto was/is running for VP. 
Right now he's trying to find proof he can carry Texas for the eventual DNC nominee.
I wanna fight him.
"The real absurdity is thinking democrats want to elect someone who’s an old, straight, white man that’s also a billionaire.  It’s basically antithetical to modern progressive thought."
It’s basically antithetical to modern progressive thought.

"""We can't let the peasants have guns! They might revolt"" "
"Bloomberg always sounds like one of the elitist pieces of shit in New York or Washington, which is really amazing considering who else is around.  "
"Most politicians like to pretend they had some relatively humble beginnings or understands the human condition.  Bloomberg just constantly feels like ""American Royalty"" and not in any sort of good way."
The average American shouldn't drive cars or have kids but we can't really stop them. Hell the average American shouldn't even vote as most Americans are pretty fucking stupid. FYI I am American.
"RIP ""nobody is coming for your guns"""
He's polling so low that there's barely a blip on the radar.  You can let go of your pearls now.
"Ill hang onto my pearls as well as my guns, thank you."
Doesn’t matter. He’s the one that pumped the most money into Virginia to get the people elected there that are now threatening to take the guns. He’s one of the primary movers behind it—and Jewish just like all the primary movers.

I agree. It’s nice to see some common sense.
From the article:
"""“We just do not want the average American carrying a gun in a crowded place….”    WE THE PEOPLE get to do whatever God and the Constitution says we can do!  You and your elites don’t grant us anything! We don’t care what you want!"""
Why would you highlight the part of the article where the author admits to talking to (and obeying) imaginary friends?
"Because the flavor of the ""journalism"" was important to note."
That flavor: boomer Facebook post.
"Hating Bloomberg - something Dems and Republicans, Libertarians and Socialists can all come together on."
"Any who advocates for gun confiscation, or even gun control for that matter, has a dangerous amount of faith and trust in the government."
So who are the above average that are worthy enough to own guns?
"For a Billionaire, this guy sure is wasting a lot of money on this presidential campaign if he's going around saying things like this."
But that rich cunt is surrounded by protective guns.
But all liberals say you are unique.  How can anyone be average?
Honestly the average American having guns is one of the many reasons the US has not been invaded by a foreign enemy (assuming we actually had those at one point).
"No, it’s our regional location."
"I guess youre the expert eh? It just <em>has</em> to be that, couldnt be for a multitude of other reasons?"
"First off, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_United_States#Early_events"">US has been invaded</a>, but yeah not in a while. Why? Being surrounded on two sides by two giant fucking oceans. The other two sides? Allies. At least after the couple times mexico <strong>invaded the US</strong>, that is. "
Two enormous fucking allied countries and two enormouser oceans.
"Our military is more than enough to repel invaders traveling to our shores and has been for a long time. No militia needed. Though Im not discouraging you, I support the neighborhood watch."
"You mean when the US intentionally ""misread"" the border and invaded Mexico because despite all our talk, we wanted to get in on the whole Imperialism business?"
"Other than that, yeah. The US hadn't beg invaded recently because even a terrible Navy would be more than enough to keep any other country away, and we've had one of the larger navies in the world fur the last century."
It is 99% geography
Anyone got a link to the video?  It doesn't show up on the article for me.
"Well we found the LEAST Libertarian candudate. Speaking of which, how do you feel about Chafee? I dont think he has a chance in hell."
"He did say 'in a ""crowded place"" which isn't that crazy. There are buildings, parks, and many areas that open carry isn't allowed."
"I am not condoning his speech, just pointing out the language used."
So that's his slogan for presidency? 😆🤣
I'd vote for Hillary-us before this despot wannabe
"Oh, once again billionaires telling us what's good for us and not, average Americans,  but ok for the rich , fuck this guy."
Because he knows that the average American will shoot back at the government to keep his freedoms.

The ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent
"This article sounds like an angry uncle's rant.  Once you resort to name calling and using God to prove points, I'm no taking you serious.  The video doesn't even work.  I think I'd prefer more of a reliable source than secondamendmentdaily."
"This is sensationalism and bad journalism. The headline is misleading, like in most of the cases of bad journalism as well. "
"Bloomberg is an easy target for sensationalism, because he is known to have some shit ideas. So taking something out of context, like here, doesn’t seem so egregious. "
"The headline reads, “we can’t let the average American have guns”. Which is a violation of our constitutional rights. This information is coming from a site named “second amendment daily”. Any reason that a news org who gets money from clicks and ads, would lie about the severity of gun grabbers? Seems a bit of conflict of interest on the information presented. "
"Now here’s what Bloomberg actually said, from what is quoted in the article. "
We just do not want the average American carrying a gun in a crowded place….”
"Still, not the most pro-gun speak in the world, but a far cry from him saying he doesn’t want the average American to own a gun. "
"TLDR: this article is shit, and fear mongering the 2A crowd for clicks and money."
We just do not want the average American carrying a gun in a crowded place
Still a violation of our constitutional rights

"Thank you for the ‘education’. ....,Still, by political persuasions, Republicans (45%), men (43%) and self-identified conservatives (40%) are the most likely key subgroups to say they personally own a gun.

"Here we go:
1. There will be a MASSIVE propaganda push by Republicans to frame this act of war as a moral necessity and to act like anyone who opposes it is working for the “enemy”. 
2. The propaganda push will include enormous appeals to American militarism disguised as patriotism: flag pins, flyovers, reverent cries to “support the troops,” as if the greatest support you can offer the troops isn’t to keep them from dying for no good reason.
3. This vague appeal to patriotism and militarism will then be directed toward a specific aim; an invasion, bombings, the takeover of oil fields, the support of proxy wars. These aims will perfectly align with the financial interests of multinational corporations.
4. The people in harm's way -- innocent civilians in Iran, mostly -- will be framed and/or dehumanized as ""the enemy."" This will include everything from racial slurs to endless talking points about their ""blood thirst"" and their ""hatred of freedom and Americans"" while ignoring that the CIA made many of these oppressive theocratic regimes in the Middle East possible in the 1950s and 1960s. It's utter bullshit.
5. When the bombs start to drop, all of the reporting will be about the small number of US troop casualties. For example, most Americans know that roughly 4,000 US troops died in Iraq. What most Americans don't know is that somewhere between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Iraqi CIVILIANS were killed in the same invasion.
6. This horror too, this murder of children, of families, the bombings of weddings &amp; birthdays, this destruction of entire regions, will be swept up under the guise of American militarism disguised as patriotism, of ""supporting our troops,"" who are ""fighting for our freedom.""
7. In the end, and there will be an end -- this isn't the beginning of World War III, this is asymmetrical slaughter -- the vast number of dead will be those who do not know why the war was waged; they will be mostly young, innocent and brown-skinned. That is the ugly truth.
8. Even the US troops - most of whom signed up out of a genuine desire to protect their country - they will be abandoned, too, as the people who waged the war, who made such big promises of ""support for the troops"" will CUT veteran’s medical care, forget the dead and move on to another profiteering scheme.
9. The only people who will benefit will be those same massive multinational corporations - oil and weapons manufacturers, particularly - who rush in to profit off the death of all those innocent brown-skinned children lying in the rubble.
10. The media - especially cable news - LOVES war. They love the spectacle, the drama. It means big profits. It means eyeballs on screens. It makes stars of their anchors. The media will ask the wrong questions, and will stick only to Pentagon talking points.
11. Cable news will work to EMPOWER warmongers by accepting ‘rumors’ crafted by the Republican propaganda machine that warn of impending harm to Americans as if it was real news, by making stars of the ‘brutal enemies’. You can see media organizations salivating over the profits.
12. What gets lost in all this bickering and drama and tragedy and spectacle is the fact that all of this is AVOIDABLE. Trump inherited a reigned-in Iran, but instead set in motion an escalation to war because he thought it would benefit himself.

"What Bullshit, there is not going to be a war. Iran fired ballistic missiles and missed what schmucks. Don't weary you're not being drafted the military does not want soy boys like you. I'm a US Navy veteran."
Wars have happened for dumber reasons than two competing powers are unwilling to back down to avoid appearing weak both to each other and domestic audiences. 
"And you're right I won't be drafted, I volunteered.  Not that being a veteran makes any difference in the world anyway"
"The worrying about war is silly Iran launched missiles and they missed American assets and it looks like it was on purpose. I believe it was a propaganda attack for Iranian consumption, it is a signal they don't want to go further. The Iranians are not crazy we could smash their country with air power alone no ground troops needed."
Lets see if we're smart enough to listen to that signal. 
The Iranians are not crazy we could smash their country with air power alone no ground troops needed.
"We've been at war for 20 years now in Iraq and Afghanistan, this idea that air power equals victory is dead and fucking buried, but too many people don't have the courage to admit we aren't as strong as we think we are."
"I swear I am so sick of hearing about how we don't need to worry about things because of our air power, whether because of what it can do or that people are supposedly afraid of it. It can't do everything you think it can do and they aren't fucking afraid of it."
"It depends on what you want to accomplish, Bush wanted to make Iraq a Democracy and in Afghanistan after we beat the Taliban we decided to rebuild the country. Both things were dumb as hell and the President and his pet neocons and the Pentagon brass decided to ignore the experts, which has happened since the end of WWII."
"Trump wants then to stop attacking and not get a nuke. Two ways to do this: one is negotiations and two is to smash them. Negotiations is cleaner more human and will make everyone happy. The smash them option is messy, cruel and no one will be happy except the military contractors. We could smash them to the point of them not being a threat for a long time with minimum American losses but there would be massive death and misery for the Iranian people. And then we pull every American out of the Middle East and tell the Saudis and Israel it's your job now. No invasion, most Americans don't give a damn about Iran. Iraq<br/>
or Syria. We don't need them anymore we have our own oil let the British who screwed the region up in the first place and the EU, Japan and China defend the oil they need."
Epstein didn’t kill himself.
Iran killed Epstein.

There appears to be the beginnings of a catastrophic economic avalanche with CBs losing control of the price fixing strategy / liquidity trap they created.
"Also, Iran is a major impeachment distraction."
They lost control a long time ago.
"As I understand it, late 60’s was where loss of control began, but the setup started at Bretton Woods with the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">Triffin Dilemma</a>. "
Late 60’s the Eurodollar was expanding the money supply and forced the US off the gold standard (due to arbitrage - $35 promise vs. $40 market).
Then add the neo-Keynesian “always expand” practice and they’ve found themselves in a position which appears they can’t get out of without global disaster.
Thanks US Federal Government!
what do you mean
Potential revolution/civil war kicking off in Virginia.
You mean the biggest cryfest of gun owners so far? They always seem to protest potential laws from democrats than actual gun control from republicans
Call me when their fat asses actually do something other than play into republican hands.
I'm not going to disagree with you.  
This time it seems to be bipartisan outrage over these proposed laws.  This tone seems different from other protests I've seen.
"It seems different because it is clearly organized by republicans. You can clearly see that by seeing how fast the outrage was built up from the moment that democrats stepped into Virginian legislature. No laws have been passed, yet massive amount of articles spammed into every subreddit possible every day and now we are the verge of a ""civil war""? Whenever I see an obvious agenda pushed THIS HARD, I have no choice but to think ""who benefits?"" and ""who is pushing this?""."
That's not true.  This has been a very grass roots affair by common people who lean both left and right.  Basically anyone who supports the 2A.
Grass roots my ass
So point me in the direction of who's leading this.  Who's your boogie man?
"I literally said who is leading this, republicans. They lost the legislature so they are back to their usual wedge topic of guns. If it was not guns then they would have went with abortion, religion or gay people. "
But feel free to post a single law that has actually been passed in Virginia.
"Oh...""Republicans""... The ever present scapegoat..."
"Go back to <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a>"
And yet you still have no passed laws to post.........
"Not to mention that your ""conspiracy"" is that Trump is trying to distract from Virginia. Why would that make any sense? gun owners rising up against democrats would be like candy to Trump."
"I know a ton of gun owners there. Does one call an afternoon engagement ""civil war""?  Because thats how long it would last. "
Those people don't fuck around and there's a lot of 'em
You think that Virginia would literally overthrow the government in an afternoon? 
Americans don't give a fuck about anything. They won't be overthrowing shit and statistically around half of those gun owners are obese and likely incapable of fighting effectively in any conflict.
"After everything that has come to the surface with this back and forth between the US and Iran. How does a military with the technology and ability to fire missiles and miss every asset they were fired at. Every missile may have hit on base, only to hit dead space. Those systems do not miss. 
I am grateful no one was hurt. But is this anything more than a election year move. Or is there a deeper motive in this distraction."
There is no reason to ever destroy history. I had a day-long argument with one of my friends about this and he literally said he doesn’t care about history or morality. It’s getting difficult to even be his friend with his delusions of Trump. One time he even said he’s okay with an authoritarian absolute state as long as it’s conservative.
"Aww, everyone is always okay with the authoritarian that agrees with everything you think.  As I understand it, being in such a situation is rare. ;) Sorry he is giving you a hard time of it.  Let him cool off and approach it more slowly next time.  You are in the right on this, and it is only a matter of presentation and timing to convince, I think."
That's basically how authoritarians get to power. We like to pretend all dictators are always unanimously hated by everyone. Yet the truth is there are always a huge amount of people that agree with them and enjoy having assurance that their values will be imposed.
"I agree that even if they do have some missiles or whatever at these sites they aren't really a threat to US homeland, only to our invading forces. "
"Most of this is due to Trump's decision to declare war via twitter vs. making formal statements. I don't think he means to attack cultural sites with no military value, but won't scratch them off the list if there are military assets or fighters hidden there as it's a pretty common tactic to do so."
Lol it just sounds tough and appeals to his anti-muslim base.
Fuck the Iranian government and I hope we continue to target their leaders. No reason to kill the citizens. Yet.
Yes a couple dead leaders is how you bring about democracy.
Who said anything about democracy?
There's no reason to kill the citizens at all. Anyone that wants to is a bloodthirsty sociopath idiot.
Is that a Ron Paul quote?
hope we continue to target their leaders
I hope someone targets yours.

Bring what?
If they want to attack our leaders go for it. I’m pretty sure they have been trying.
"Well, we will see what Trump’s actual response to US bases being attacked is soon. I say he will attack cultural sites and civilian targets as he is a barbarian that loves war crimes then justify it because of terrorists."
1/8 Edit: Happy to be wrong but things aren’t over yet. The US military still hasn’t left Iraq after being expelled in an Iraq vote and Trump’s response was more economic warfare via additional sanctions.
Which war crimes has he committed thus far?
Most of this is due to Trump's decision to declare war via twitter vs. making formal statements.
"""Going to war with Iran would be fine if Trump just did it the right way"""
~ Democrats 2020
"How is that not an ok statement? The right way is if Iran directly attacked us and then we have a congressional vote, etc. Doing things through tweets is the absolute wrong way and any libertarian would see problems with how the president is behaving."
How is that not an ok statement?
"17 years in Iraq, 19 years in Afghanistan, and people are seriously still asking this question."
"If he wants his war with Iran, he ought to come to Congress and present evidence to demonstrate why. That's how our Constitution is written."
Haven't heard from Massie in a while. Glad he's still out there though.
"Wtf, if Congress says it ok, we can commit war crimes now? I didn't realize the only thing that made bombing a cultural sight morally wrong was doing so without the blessing of Congress."
"Original war crime was missile strikes on Syria in response to a chemical false flag attack that was obvious even to some of his supporters at the time. Further war crimes include his use of sanctions, airstrikes on Iraq territory who are supposedly US allies, logistics support for the genocide campaign conducted by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, and we can’t forget his pardons of criminal Navy SEALs that were turned in by their own squad mates for war crimes."
I can't believe he pardoned that Navy SEAL. And people ACTUALLY supported it
What’s this we shit?
"Destroying cultural sites is what ISIS and the Taliban do. Not America. We destroy culture by commoditizing it, but that's another discussion."
"If they are being used to house military materials they become legitimate targets. Not saying this is the instant case, but there are provisions for attacking otherwise off limits structures pursuant to international law. So, they aren’t always immune."
which would have been easy to explain if you use formal statements instead of declaring war via tweets.
Why are you justifying this? Trump was supposed to stop a war with Iran not be involved in one.
"He is steel manning the opposing argument, in order to show everyone here how to tear it down, I’d hope.  What he just said is the strongest argument you can make in support of an Iran war.  Now tear it to pieces!"
If they are being used to house military materials
Reminds me of when Colin Powell insisted Saddam had mobile nuclear weapons labs.  Or when Rumsfeld said all the nukes had been moved to Syria.
Guess we won't know what's in Iran until we finish bombing it.
I'd really love to have a better view of the situation without any bias one way or another. Do you have any good sources following the situation on Iran? I'm just curious if there's any evidence that these cultural sites housing significant number of terrorists? Not that I think even that is a green light to carpet bomb these places.
The other side of this is that Trump is only threatening to bomb cultural sites to scare Iran from retaliating and that he doesn’t actually intend to go through with it. The act is illegal but the threat isn’t. If he went through with it he would know himself that he’d lose the election in a landslide. So he probably wouldn’t even if he could.
"Not following through on threats just emboldens the enemy. When you have the most powerful military in the world you don't need to make threats, you stop the attacks in progress then just retaliate and say why you did it after the fact. "
Speak softly and carry a big stick.
"I’m pretty sure that’s what he’s been doing. There was a history of warnings, sanctions, and minor conflicts until the embassy was the last line to cross. Trump thereafter used the “big stick,” the event of which everyone is now discussing. His threatening to bomb cultural sites now is just touting that stick and hanging it over their heads. If it wasn’t illegal and everyone was suddenly psychopathic, Trump definitely could bomb those sites. He’s betting that by threatening to do so, right after sending in the drone strike earlier, Iran won’t retaliate. Then he doesn’t have to go through with anything and the enemy isn’t emboldened."
I prefer the matter-of-fact approach of finding out who is responsible for the attack and killing all of them all the way up the chain no matter where they are. That's what happened here. 
The sanctions are already making good progress in turning the people against the leaders in Iran and threatening to blow up their cultural centers and kill civilians vs. making it clear we are targeting the leadership doesn't help with those efforts.
"Just to be clear, are you saying you approve of Trump’s method or do you disapprove? Or am I missing your point? I’m not really advocating for or against his actions so far, just offering a different way to look at his threatening to bomb cultural sites. Beyond being grateful that another terrorist is dead, I won’t pretend to personally know the best way to bring peace and stability to Iran after all they’ve been through."
I don't approve of his method of making vague threats via twitter. I do approve of killing the enemy even if they hide behind sensitive targets.
"I think the best deterrent is an automatic response that punishes the decision makers more than the population as much as possible. Attacking the US should be like touching a hot iron, you know for a fact you will get burned."
"EDIT: I should preface this attitude with that I also don't believe in being the aggressor and invading other countries and that we should be fair with other countries, but attacking us should be unthinkable."
"I might be more or less willing to agree depending on how “sensitive” the targets they’re hiding behind are. Minimizing casualties should be the second top priority in the act of conflict or full-scale war. The first priority being victory. I do agree with the metaphor you use though, “Attacking the US should be like touching a hot iron, you know for a fact you will get burned.”"
I think you are drastically overstating the care the United States citizens in general have for Iranian cultural sites. I have been waiting for any politician to finally stand up them. That have been killing our military through proxy terrorist for decades. I for one don’t think they can do much of anything to us except what they have been doing. Ask Gaddafi how that worked out for him in the eighties. Like it or not we are the world’s sheriff. I’m not a huge fan of it but if we are then we should do it in a way they understand.
"Have you seen the movie, <em>True Lies</em>? Q.E.D."
"Iran has a large and modern military. They aren't housing weapons at cultural sites, ffs, they're doing so on their large and fortified military instillations"
Sheesh
I dunno these culture sites were probably built in strategic military locations right?
Shithouse lawyer doesn't know what he's talking about.
Remember when the redcaps all claimed that bloodthirsty Hillary was going to get us involved in a war?
Remember when everyone with at least a semester of International Relations education said President Trump would blunder us into a war?
Who was right?
He’s just talking tough.
If they're used as shields just as the Taliban/ISIS use children as human shields then fuck their cultural sites.
"With that said, why can't old Moscow Mitch be more like Massie? Good old Kentucky bois should think more alike."
the Taliban/ISIS use children as human shields
American willingness to bomb schools and hospitals getting spun as the Taliban using human shields is some Nth-level bullshit.
"I've stopped caring about people in other countries, innocent or guilty. Really though, why should I care about someone 6000 miles away?"
Why care about anyone anywhere?
"It's not like they are storing nukes under old statues, its more like mosques acting as community centers for the ""freedom fighters"" where they will house fighters as well as small arms caches. Sure in some cases they intentionally hide in areas that are sensitive to bomb, but mostly its out of practicality."
"If they are full of mullah terrorists, then they are a threat."
"I'm sorry, a 1,000 year mosque with a terrorist inside of it is a legitimate military target."
"I'm happy we finally have a president who has his priorities straight, keeping America safe always comes first."
Let the archeologists worry about the pipes of ruble.
Ok boomer.
Endless engagement chasing shadows is bleeding our country dry of money and hurting us at home.
Like ground to air missiles which can’t distinguish bombers from passenger jets. 
Or perhaps just poorly trained soldiers who are trigger happy.
"Iran has the Russian S-300 AA battery, which is amongst the best in the world."
Yes but they also have an assortment of other equipment. It’s a hodgepodge of units and equipment from WW2 to the Cold War to the most modern stuff just released. 
Plus that was more of a sarcastic comment.
"Yeah, definitely. It’s a crapshoot to try and guess what they have around Tehran."
Yes but more importantly like a web of influence throughout the entire Iraqi government they can use to possibly get Iraq to ask for us to remove our military without firing a shot.
"I know you're trying to downplay their capabilities, maybe because you're a right-wing hawk who thinks America is inevitable even after we can't win a lasting peace in either Iraq or Afghanistan after 20 decades, but an air to ground missile that can shoot down a bomber (even if they accidentally shoot down a passenger jet though that was actually the US that did that not Iran) is a serious capability.  And untrained trigger happy soldiers are the reason the US has to hide in huge fortified bases, they aren't nothing to worry about they're a serious concern"
(even if they accidentally shoot down a passenger jet though that was actually the US that did that no Iran)
Wow.
Just...wow.
The fucking propaganda from you worthless pieces of tankie shit is just hilarious.
"The US was firing ground-to-air missiles indiscriminately?  Really?  Why?  To combat Iran's air force, which is about as threatening as a high school ROTC club?"
You're so full of bullshit that you can't even keep facts straight.  Fuck off you worthless tankie scum.
The fucking propaganda from you worthless pieces of tankie shit is just hilarious.

"Lol, are you seriously trying to claim this is the exact same incident?"
Christ you're a retard.
To young is my guess but american naval forces blew an Iranian 747 out of the air thinking it was an f14. 
You'll be happy to know the coverage was American exceptionalism at its best. Iran was at fault for the American shooting down the 747. They clearly shouldn't have let iran have passnager planes!
Completely different from Malaysia air in Ukraine.
To young is my guess but american naval forces blew an Iranian 747 out of the air thinking it was an f14.
"Oh, was that yesterday?"
"Oh, it wasn't?"
Then it's not relevant to what happened yesterday.
"Hell, if we wanna go back to the past, then the US is entirely justified in doing all of this because of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">52 hostages Iran slaughtered and hung from cranes</a>."
"So, are you going to continue pretending like past conflicts are the same as current conflicts?  Because if so, then you support this war in Iran because they slaughtered 52 of our citizens."
Dude. Read some history. The US and UK backed a coup in the 60s and set up a Western friendly regime. The Iranians got kind of upset about it and overthrew the government and Ruhollah Khomeini became supreme leader. Some people don't forget decades of a country on the other side of the world messing with their affairs and surrounding their country with military bases. We've been looking for a reason to go to war with Iran forever. We ended up backing Sadam to counter the crazy we caused in Iran in the first place. Then HE was a bad guy. Same with Afghanistan. We trained the mujahedeen to fight the Soviets. Then THEY became the bad guys. Our country's foreign policy is a joke and the reason we have most of the problems we have in that region.
"It's funny because the leader they couped had just couped his own country to remove power from the Shah and give it to himself, but hey that totally didn't happen Kapp. The US totally initiated the first coups ever in Iran Kapp."
"And what exactly does a coup on the other side of the world have to do with us? That's my whole point. If we weren't constantly involved in the region, there wouldn't be an issue. Most people don't seem to realize this, but we don't HAVE to play world police all the time. 
All this boils down to is we're buddies with the Saudis and they and Iran are constantly struggling for dominance. You can't kill Americans if there aren't any Americans around for you to kill."
So are past conflicts the same as current conflicts?
"Because if so, then Iran started this aggression when the Ottoman Empire, which they were a part of, declared war on the Entente Powers in WWI."
"So if past conflicts are the same as current conflicts, then this war is once again justified.  According to you, at least."
Interesting that you don’t want to go back in time all the way to 1953 when the CIA did one of their famous regime change operations in Iran.
or further back when the nation as a whole decided to steal/nationalize the oil industry because of that sweet sweet oil money
"Interesting that you don't want to go back in time all the way to 1914 when the Ottoman Empire, of which Iran was a part, declared war on the Entente Powers."
"The double standard you have is hilarious. You should become a cop, you'd fit right in."
So is that a yes?  Past conflicts are the same as current conflicts?
"Well, fuck you for supporting war in Iran then."
The draft was never going to happen. We use institutional poverty now.
What do you mean?
Keep people poor and make it seem like military service is the only way out.
Not just make it seem. Make it functionally the best option
For now.  Prepared Speech Trump and Twitter Trump are two very different people.
An excellent point.
To be clear I don't take issue with anything he said in his statement.
But that's been the case before and he's gone and fucked it up so I'd prefer to reserve my judgment.
Too many people around here dispose of their skepticism the moment someone tells them something they want to hear.
"Serious question, has a war ever started because of Twitter?"
American Civil War
I don’t think Twitter was around in 1861 🤔
Carrier pigeon?
"Not as far as I'm aware, but there's a first time for everything."
"More to the point, he constantly uses his prepared statements to backtrack on his off-the-cuff remarks and his off-the-cuff remarks to backtrack on his written statements.  Nothing in the last few years has indicated that his short prepared statement should be assumed accurate as to future policy.  I do not trust him because he is <em>not trustworthy.</em>  He has demonstrated as much time and time again.  The only thing reliable about him is his unreliability."
"Right--so, everybody back to Call of Duty!"
"Details of the situation aside, if another foreign war is averted then this is good."
I wont mock him for (seemingly) standing down.
now we wait for Twitter Trump's take on the situation however
Says who? Don't say Trump because his words are meaningless.
"Watch it, your bias is showing"
"Nah, better off reading his twitter feed. His words don't mean anything."
And yet his twitter feed is words in visual form.
[deleted]
When the hell did Iraq attack America?
[deleted]
That was Afghanistan.
(Though actually radical Saudis but that was an inconvenient truth)
We were attacked by Iraq? Lolwut
"Setting the draft aside, you are crazy af if you think this is over."
"Right, I don’t see Iran laying down after not causing any American casualties. They will engage their proxy network, if need be."
Trump blinked.
"A lot of tinfoilhat ""libertarians"" will find something else to complain about this speech."
He mispronounced a word and emphasized on bolstering our military! Bad man bad!
/s
"Did Iran seriously miss intentionally in last night’s attack? How could they allow that, after their country’s most admired General was just assassinated by the US?"
"I’m glad there seems to be a deescalation, but Iran is giving Trump an undeserved win here."
"The Iranian government obviously has to save face and project strength.  Its part of the culture.  So now they can go back and say ""We have struck a mighty blow to the Great Satan with our holy missiles blessed by Allah the most Merciful and his Prophet PBUH!!!""  "
Even if the only thing they managed to blow up was an unoccupied porta-shitter.
Were they actually intimidated by Trump’s threat? Sure looked to me like he was bluffing and ready to blink in response to the next American casualty.
"Not to mention, Congress was imminently going to reduce his war powers, effectively neutering his threats."
Were they actually intimidated by Trump’s threat? Sure looked to me like  he was bluffing and ready to blink in response to the next American  casualty.
"Not sure how you figured that, but fair enough."
"Not to mention, Congress was imminently going to reduce his war powers, effectively neutering his threats."
"The house more than likely may have, the senate, maybe.  But its doubtful they could override a veto.  So the point is pretty well moot."
edit: words
"Iran can’t risk anything against the US, they would get decimated. They lost their #2 with the click of a button. A full on war would result in Iran losing in 2 shakes of a lamb tail. Iran has little to gain and everything to lose"
"His supporters will consider anything a win, so that matters little."
"On the other hand, Iran has shown itself to be a more reasonable nation which will make the formation of coalitions against it that much harder. USA has acted like a rogue nation and will be treated as such in the future. They also will get a much more massive domestic boost because nothing unites a nation more than an external enemy."
Are you an American?
I am. Why?
Giving trump an undeserved win?
Isn’t a win for trump a win for all America in the situation?
"Not when Trump is a direct threat to our democratic institutions, no."
So you’d rather us go to war?
Found the neo liberal
Isn't that a straw man? He specifically said he's glad there's a deescalation.
"<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/elv9f5/war_adverted_no_draft/fdkgn3c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/elv9f5/war_adverted_no_draft/fdkgn3c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>"
Where did he say he'd rather us go to war?
No draft because it would intensify opposition to the neocon agenda. The US government learned their lesson from Vietnam. Better to recruit poor people instead.
That's not saying much about the Democratic party....
Especially since they actively worked against him in 2016.
I just mean that the crazy avowed socialist is the 'best bet'
"Ah yes, the best way to discredit anyone is to call them ""crazy"" because you don't understand anything about them."
"No, I call him crazy because I think the ideology that he preaches is utterly insane by the definition of the word. I believe that to preach banging your head into a wall to cure headaches is slightly more sane that what Bernie preaches."
Bernie Sanders nomination will guarantee trump winning. But I mean. Vote LP either way.
"Seriously, the people who think Bernie is the Democrat with the best chance at beating trump is probably someone in their 20s from NYC or LA. America will not vote for a socialist"
The same poll numbers that people ignored when they said Trump couldn’t win the GOP nomination are the same numbers that Biden is showing against the Democratic field. Biden will win the nomination and he will likely win the presidency. 
Bernie will not have enough people holding their noses to vote for him against trump
No but america will vote for a social democrat. And the only person who will do anything to get money out of politics. Which is who bernie sanders is
Lol
I’d love to see you explain how they’re wrong. 
"Sanders’ politics aside, he is honest."
I’ll give you that. He’s honest about stealing from businesses and individuals.
Nah
It’s funny how you leftists on this sub get so fucking butt hurt when the libertarians here disapprove of socialism and politicians in general. 
Like... what the fuck did you think would  happen? 
"There are subs for you and your friends tho. R/democrat <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> <a href=""/r/socialism"" rel=""nofollow"">r/socialism</a>. Etc...  "
"You and retardican president, meatsimn64, mist rising, guineapig etc ... can all go have productive conversations about socialism and other non libertarian ideas. Have fun!"
So basically you have no rebuttal.
Thanks for admitting you’re full of shit.
Wrong again you dipshit. Lol 😂 
Don’t worry. I’ll start adding your name to the list since you want to be known as a retarded leftist on this sub too. 
You and your stupid butt buddies deserve each other. Lol 😂
Thanks for proving me right.
"Oh, I dunno.  He's the opposite of Trump in the way that matters most: he's genuine and honest"
Which historically means he won't get elected.
"Bernie leads Trump in polling, by a hair but still leads. Bidens the one who leads by a mile though. DSA just doesn't wanna feel that bern."
I recall the polls showing Hilary beating the pants off trump...
Yes. Margin of error. Any other comments Trump propaganda shill #2?
On election day he had a 3% chance of winning. 
Not propaganda
538 gave him favorable odds at 29% which is fairly high odds. That means 1 in 3 chance he comes out winning. Those are damn good odds.
Others have given him a 20-1 odds to win. That’s pretty bad.
"Polls showed Hillary beating Trump by 3.3%, she in fact won by 2.7%. ThE PoLlS WeRe So fAr oFf"
He was the most electable Democrat in 2016 too.
And that means not a damn thing will get done....Perfect!
Except for more bureaucracy.

<strong>CRINGE</strong>
What kind of libertarian cant get behind a candidate who unifies us all behind government control of large swaths of the economy? 
For the nation at large Bernie's Socialist label is much more of a detriment than his misguided policies themselves.   His only chance is suppressing the involvement of voters over 30 while getting record number of 18-29 year olds to vote for him.
"Lincoln Chafee is not a libertarian, he has no place representing the Libertarian Party. His record is terrible:"
Shut up cuck
"Lmao, says the 1 minute old account named ""he1l-h1tler"""
His voting record sucks. No more establishment approved candidates.

Libertarish presidential run.
This is an unfortunate result of tax laws and health insurance regulations that push employers to pay for employees' healthcare instead of individuals paying for it themselves.
"When government pays for healthcare, they're going to pass laws to regulate peoples' personal decisions.  When employers pay for healthcare, they're going going to make policies that do the same."
"If we had a freer market for health insurance and healthcare, in addition to having lower prices, we would not have business and government trying to regulate peoples' personal decisions."
Nation's Hamburgers in California has had this policy since the 80's. Nothing to do with healthcare. I think they just don't like smokers.
"It's up to the company to decide with whom they choose to associate. It's too bad, though, if they are doing so because government has imposed costs upon them."
I think it's a stupid decision because nicotine can be used in a way that doesn't impact health insurance costs in a meaningful way.  I know people who have used gums for decades that could run a half marathon at a moment's notice.
"having said that, U-Haul is absolutely entitled to make stupid decisions."
"Yeah well if statistics hold true and 50million people in America are addicted to nicotine in some way.... Uhaul will be looking to find 4,500 new employees of their 30k (15%)"
It literally says in the article that they will not apply this to current employees who use nicotine. Nobody is getting fired.
Okay clearly missed that in the article. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
"The nicotine patch companies should love this. Those bad boys are expensive, especially if you get them at a CVS or Walgreens. A pack of 7 patches will set you back $25. "
"Obviously patches are less expensive than cigarettes, but at least with smoking you aren’t struggling with withdrawals."
Or the smokers dont apply to work for Uhaul.
"As is their absolute right. I think it’s a dumb policy, but the current trend is for employers to ban smoking. I should have mentioned this in my comment: if someone does want to quit or just needs to last through an 8 hour shift without smoking, Amazon sells packs of 28 patches for $30."
It's a smart policy. Smokers are massive health cost. They cost a lot of money on otherwise preventable issue. They also tend to increase lossed revenue from sick days and less productive work.
Businesses are in the business of profit. Cutting the smokers out as much as possible not only makes the bill for healthcare (which they must cover legally) go down but also keeps productivity high.
Well fat people too you may add .
Wtf is that
"Freedom of association. You know, a central tenet of libertarianism."
"Wow this should be illegal, it’s literally moving in the opposite direction it should."
They are a private business. They can hire whomever they want. Having nicotine free will reduce their healthcare costs.
That’s fair didn’t think of it that way
"Another reason why healthcare shouldn't be tied to one's employer.  If your employer shoulders a big part of that cost, people will argue it should be able to influence how you live your life outside of work.  That makes you less free."
They are a private business.
Can't the paradox of tolerance argument be used here?
It can but if you try it he'll call you a commie and recite 10 Hail Markets
I am a commie and an agnostic.
“ we don’t have tolerate intolerance”? Hmm. Not sure. This “intolerance” isn’t because of hate or bigotry.
"I'm not sure if you're understanding the ""paradox of tolerance"" argument. Basically, if you tolerate everything, the intolerant will come into power and impose their intolerance. 100% tolerance will destroy itself."
"Here, one could argue that businesses having too much freedom will ultimately restrict freedom. Isn't it a freedom to do whatever you want off the clock, especially something as personal as what you consume?"
"Okay. I see your point. I would say you could probably like in the nicotine to marijuana. They’re not going to drug test you every Monday morning so you could smoke occasionally. However if you’re a chronic smoker, weed or tobacco, you’re going to fail their test."
Edit; maybe this makes more sense. Compare nicotine to alcohol. You’re more than welcome to drink on the weekends but you can’t come to work testing positive for alcohol consumption. Wouldn’t nicotine fall under the same premise?
"Even in a zero government world, if 9/10 companies won't hire you because of nicotine use, how in practice is it any different than government telling you not to use nicotine?"
"That's the paradox of tolerance argument that someone else could make against this precedence. ""Too much"" freedom will destroy itself."
Like with alcohol they’re not telling you you cant use it. Just telling you you can’t be addicted to it. You can’t use it every single day so it affects the company that you work for. In the case of nicotine cigarette breaks takes away from company time and testing positive for nicotine will increase their healthcare costs.
That's not very libertarian of you.
"I suppose I was thinking of personal freedoms not business freedoms, makes sense now tho"
Corporations are ultimately just one or more people working towards a common goal
"I'm torn between ""It's their business they can hire whoever they want"" and ""It's none of their business what their employees do off the clock"""
"You can support that they can do whatever they want as a pricate business but still disagree with a decision they've made. Heck, you can even boycott them which is what I do when a business does something I dislike. "
Take EA and Battlefront 2 for instance back in 2017. 
It's true they can do whatever they want and put lootboxes in their game but at the same time I think they were idiots for doing it and boycotted them as a result of it.
"This is my exact dilemma, and there's no perfect solution. The only plausible one is you aren't allowed to smoke while working, but that really doesn't have much of an effect."
I worked at a bank that had this policy.  I got hired even though i smoked because i was a contractor.  But anyone they had to pay health insurance for (full time employees) they would not hire you if you smoked.  It was almost like it was about the money they spent on healthcare rather than they really cared about people.
Sales tax. Non compulsory. Tariffs are the same but hurt free trade so bad.
Sales tax is <em>worse</em> than both income tax and tariffs!
It's a domestic tariff!
non compulsory
The question assumes the gov would use force.
There still using force. If you avoid the sales tax a guy with a gun comes to you.
Income tax. Income tax with multiple tax brackets and writeoffs &amp; deductions for tangible &amp; necessary expenses for households &amp; businesses falls more heavily on unearned income derived from private rights violations and denying others the exclusive use of their labor. Indirect taxes on wealth such as tariffs and sales taxes are more harmful to the accumulation of wealth by the poor and reduce competition among suppliers.
Fuck Donald Trump
"Oh wow, how dare they fight back!"
The broke the fundamental rule of war.........which is to always roll over and let the Americans win.
"I bet if we blow up something else they'll stop, and if they don't we'll just keep blowing stuff up until it does work!"
FYI
looks like the war is off bois
I feel like he honestly just said nothing
So is he staying in Iraq? 
Like wth was that lol
I'll translate:
I don't have a plan but I'm not escalating or starting a war. Can the rest of you guys fix that nuclear thing?
All in all. Good news.
He didn't announce an invasion?  I would call that a win.
"I mean he didn't not announce it too, if that makes sense"
He did claim he wants NATO to invade though? Not sure what he actually meant by that
Lol.   Half of what trump says is gibberish.
People won't care.  
Average person has no problem with taking others rights away and treating others like second class citizens - as long as it's someone else.  
But if their rights are lowered they will be the first ones to complain non stop.  Want your rights?  Defend people like this.
"I am still waiting for the glorious freedom fighting gun owners to go out and fight against this obvious tyranny? Wait, they seem to be cheering or not caring? Hmm, weird."
"They are law-abiding gun owners, and that would be illegal."
"Man the sure care about all laws other than the ones that affect them. I am sure when a state like Virginia proposes a gun control law, they will calmly and rationally act. Checks... oh boy"
"Only a complete idiot would want an armed insurrection for something like this; and if someone did take up arms against something like this, you would probably call them a terrorist because it doesn't really fit with your agenda."
You have almost reached self-awareness. You would be labelled as a terrorist regardless of what reason you rebel for. And the rest of the country would cheer your execution.
Reaching minds and hearts with your virtues and charisma
It is impossible to reach that which does not exist.
Not if you actually win...
And then you label others as terrorists and kill them. Almost like it is a bad idea to rely on pure strength to make decisions.
"When you take your meds tomorrow, don't break the pill in half...take the whole thing."
"Cute, go jack off yourself while stroking your gun. We both know you will never actually use it for anything else."
It is a shame that unlawfully detaining US citizens is a non-issue here compared to anything to do with guns.
I've been trying to get into people's heads for months and it's like pulling teeth
"Listen, if he'd just been armed to the teeth while passing through the airport, it's pretty obvious that they'd have let him board no problem."
"If there's one way to get the police to btfo, it's to be a heavy armed brown fighting-age male."
They’re detaining brown people so it’s OK
Iranians aren't even brown. They aren't any browner than Bernie Sanders. You literally can't tell them apart besides their passport and names.
Iranians come in a multitude of shades.  
Those thick lush eyelashes though...
"People seem to be pretty upset about this here.  Gun rights are supposedly a conservative issue too, so you get amplification from the conservatives and Republicans who come here.  Detaining a citizen should be everyone's issue, but I think it is more the actual libertarians that are upset.  I haven't seen anyone saying they support this though.  Everything has been condemning it.  Hardly a non-issue."
Minor events about guns get thousands of upvotes while these events receive hundreds at best. This one didn't even reach 100.
"Perhaps because gun rights have been under attack in this country for a very long time and consistently, while this specific case is new and has largely been sensationalized.  He is an Iranian-born director of a Middle East political center traveling abroad and he admitted that they stopped him for ten minutes and only asked him when he had last been in Libya and what the political climate was in Iran.  He said he has never been to Libya and that the second question sounded like a political one. The officer then handed him his passport and he left.  That was it."
There are legitimate cases of detention worthy of mass outrage.  This is a stretch.  This seems more like someone grabbed the first story of an Iranian being targeted in the slightest and trying to make a mountain of a molehill instead of discussing the actual mountains . . . And it still got lots of upvotes as an obvious effort to sensationalize a trivial incident.  I'd say that's more outrage than this specific case merits.
Except this is far from the first time US citizens have been detained for no other crime than having the wrong nationality or skin color.
Yet libertarians still seem to be worried about gun ownership despite USA being the most armed nation in the world. And barely worried about anything else.
"It sounds like you aren't talking to libertarians then.  This particular incident, where a man was asked two questions, one of which he declined to answer, and was then free to leave, is hardly the hill to die on.  There are plenty of other incidents that are disturbing, and I think libertarians are and should be concerned.  The government has no right to detain us for no reason, for discriminatory reasons, or to go on a fishing trip in the hope of randomly finding a problem.  Such incidents that violate the 4th and 5th should concern all of us just as much as violations of the 2nd."
I also remember the glee with which this sub defended the nazi running over protesters. And the glee with which this sub upvoted the whole transgenderism is child abuse bullshit from a conservative think tank. 
"Gun owners seem to always find a new hill that is worth dying, it just happens to be not the hill for today. "
So why the fuck should I care about your right to own guns if you do not care about any right but the right to own guns?
"I think you should care about your own right to own guns, as well as your own right to not be stopped and detained for no reason.  Libertarians are concerned with the rights of the individual, not minorities.  If you protect the rights of the individual, then you protect everyone, including minorities.  You are presenting a strange argument here.  Why should you care about someone's right to guns if that's the only right they care about?  Because that is also your right to guns.  You can still support it even if some people care about it more than other rights that you think are more important or equally important.  I'm not gay, so gay marriage is not a huge issue for me.  I do strongly support it though because I think individuals should have the right to marry who they want to marry.  I know a lot of gay people who were essentially single issue voters before gay marriage was legalized because gay marriage was a huge issue for them.  Should I be outraged by that?  Should I complain that they prioritized their preferred right over other rights?  Most pro- gay marriage politicians were also anti-gun.  So why should I support their gay marriage rights when they don't care about my gun rights?!!?  That's your argument, and it is silly.  You can support all of your rights, and thereby support the rights of every individual.  People may feel more strongly about some rights than others.  They may be more inclined to speak about some rights than others.  That's ok.  You are angry because a forum that is supposed to be libertarian, but that is often full of republicans, is upvoting gun rights posts more than this post about a man being detained for ten minutes to answer two questions.  Think about that.  I'm not sure why you were expecting anything else, and saying things like ""why the fuck should I care about your right to own guns if you do not care about any right but the right to own guns?"" completely misses the point of libertarianism.  You should care about their gun rights because they are your gun rights, just like you should care about that Iranian-born man's rights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures because those are your rights too."
"We care about rights of individuals, except not that one. Thanks, good to know. "
"I do not care about gun rights because I do not need a gun. Short-sighted? Perhaps. But do not pretend libertarians are better with their whole: ""I did not consent to paying for taxes, I just want to pick and choose where my money goes"""
"I am not gay but I am pro LGBT rights because LGBT people are not a threat to me, and them getting rights only helps me because the same laws that prevent the discrimination of gay people are the ones that prevent discrimination of other protected classes. "
"Gun owners are a threat to me because them exercising their rights quite often means that my rights are trampled. Lets say I voted for a politician who made gun owners unhappy and they fight against his ""tyranny"". Well, that means my representative got removed from my power and my democratic rights were screwed over. "
Gun owners have shown themselves to be interested only in their rights and their right to own a dangerous item that can kill me without me ever being able to do anything about it.
"We care about rights of individuals, except not that one. Thanks, good to know. "
Except what one?  What are you talking about?  We care about the 4th and the 5th and I just said unlawful detentions cannot be tolerated.  What are you talking about?
I do not care about gun rights because I do not need a gun.
"So by your logic, why should I give a fuck about whatever rights you care about if you don't care about the rights I care about?  It sounds like you aren't much of a libertarian yourself."
"I am not gay but I am pro LGBT rights because LGBT people are not a threat to me, and them getting rights only helps me because the same laws that prevent the discrimination of gay people are the ones that prevent discrimination of other protected classes. "
"I don't know why we should care about protected classes, as we are all individuals and protecting the rights of individuals protects all of us, but ok."
"Gun owners are a threat to me because them exercising their rights quite often means that my rights are trampled. Lets say I voted for a politician who made gun owners unhappy and they fight against his ""tyranny"". Well, that means my representative got removed from my power and my democratic rights were screwed over. "
"What the hell are you talking about?  So if gun owners don't like a politician and they vote him out, but you liked him, your rights are violated?  How?  What if the politician you like offended gays and they vote him out instead?  Do you view gay people as a threat now?  What if he angers Muslims and they vote him out?  I guess Muslims are a threat now too.  You have a poor grasp of democracy."
Gun owners have shown themselves to be interested only in their rights and their right to own a dangerous item that can kill me without me ever being able to do anything about it. 
"You have now revealed yourself to be just an anti-gun troll.  Gun owners are not some collective with the specific attributes you dislike.  They are men and women of all ages and races and religions and sexual orientations, etc.  They are liberals and conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, libertarians and communists.  You are making ugly and ignorant generalizations, and you have lost all credibility with your complaints.  You are not concerned that we are paying too much attention to gun rights.  You just admitted you don't like gun rights or gun owners.  Perhaps the problem isn't with the people here who stand up for all individual rights, but with people like you who would take those sacred rights from others."
"Because they never cared about fighting for freedom with their guns. They only care about their freedom to own guns and keeping the ""wrong"" people out of government (wrong=dark skinned). Just look at how gun sales spiked under Obama."
Edit:
"Downvotes but but no actual arguments. You must be true gun owners, all bark and no bite."
They only care about their freedom to own guns 
"Their toys, you mean.  Occasionally you find one that has the stones to admit it.  The rest pretend that they are some sort of freedom fighter in waiting"
I respect the ones who say: I like my gun and would like to have it. I despise those who pretend that they are glorious freedom fighters in waiting. Always in waiting.
"They only care about their freedom to own guns and <em>fantasizing about</em> keeping the ""wrong"" people out of government"
Obama won the Presidency and half the South started crying about how they were going to secede.  The closest they every got was the nutters up in Nevada occupying a bird watching station.
Gun sales spiked becaus Obama was anti gun not becaus he was black
"Passed fewer gun control measures than Trump so far. Either he was completely incompetent, so why freak out, or might be that there is more than being anti-gun."
"Because Democrats are anti gun, Obama ran a n anti gun trump did not. Just because politicians don’t do what they’re elected to do doesn’t mean people don’t anticipate them doing what they’re elected to do. It’s the same reason, under a white governor, Virginia is going crazy right now. People expect politicians to do what they say they’ll do"
"Libertarians: we can never trust politicians, unless of course it is convenient for our arguments"
Did the NRA denounce Trump? Nope. Is this the first time republicans enacted massive gun control measures? Nope. 
"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. "
If gun owners are that dumb then they really should not own anything more dangerous than a pocket knife.
Because Democrats are anti gun
Democrats would be 100% pro-gun if there was even the hint of NRA support.  They're easily bought and more than happy to compromise.
That the party has taken a hard line against the 2nd Amendment is as much an indictment of the pro-gun movement as it is the Dem Party.
Name some of the many anti-gun legislation Obama passed.
Do not bother. He is long gone.
"I'm sure if dude had a gun, wasnt shot and had it confiscated, this sub would be calling for civil war"
"This is bad, but I really wish they would stop with always throwing out these titles as if it is worse to do this to an Ivy League professor.  Would it be less offensive to do this to a state college professor?  How about a plumber?  Would it be fine if he was a part-time janitor?  Have you ever met any Ivy League professors?  If I was looking to find a radical, I might start there.  Are spies and terrorists and foreign agents only allowed to work outside of the Ivy League?  I'm not suggesting this guy did anything wrong at all, but citing his job all over the news and this title is just silly.  Call these people citizens or legal residents and then be outraged.  Being an elite academic hardly qualifies anyone as being immune from political radicalism or crime."
"I think the implication might be that he was targeted because he is a professor. That being under the assumption that a professor would have greater connections to the regime. Still ridiculous, but they might be trying to spin it the other way."
"I didn't read any of them that way.  They seem to be trying to establish that it is more outrageous because this is a successful, established person who is still being targeted, like that black professor who was arrested by a white cop trying to break into his own house in Boston a few years ago.  They kept saying the same thing then.  He is a professor for crying out loud!  That interaction was wrong as well, but the fact that the guy was a professor was only mentioned to show that he was a person of high standing in society and therefore unlikely to be a criminal and so the actions taken were particularly unreasonable, even though his occupation was irrelevant under the circumstances.  He was breaking into a house at night, not lecturing at Harvard.  I see the point you are making, but this man was the director of the Middle East Center, so he certainly had connections and deep interest in the events in Iran.  If the purpose of mentioning his job was to explain why he was of interest, they would have said ""Iranian-born Director of Middle East Center briefly detained and questioned after traveling abroad"".  The man himself stated that he was asked to wait for approximately ten minutes and asked only two questions: When were you last in Libya, and what is the sentiment in the Middle East?  He said he had never been to Libya and then said the sentiment sounded like a political question.  The officer then returned his passport and let him leave.  That was it.  Is that ok?  I have no idea because I don't know if they had some reason to question him, but posts like these that sensationalize these issues by throwing in his title to make it seem more outrageous that they would do such a horrible thing to a professor are just obnoxious.  We should focus on the cases where people are actually detained, not just try to sensationalize the first Iranian who gets stopped for ten minutes and asked two questions after traveling abroad.  Wrongful detention is bad.  This is a stretch."
It’s like things only get worse under Trump each month
WTF??? Homeland Security are stopping people and asking questions ??? What kind of sick fucking world is this???
Stopping people or stopping certain people?
"While I'm not in favor of stopping people without good reason, if you are going to stop people without good reason it seems to me that it's better to stop specific people than just random people."
If you know roughly what/who you're looking for profiling seems like a far more efficient use of resources.
"The problem with that is that the only qualifier for the profile is ""shares physical features with a billion other people"". It's stop and frisk on a larger scale, that's all."
"The problem with that is that the only qualifier for the profile is ""shares physical features with a billion other people"""
First of all I think narrowing it down to just a billion people is a pretty good start.
"But, you could also limit it to stuff like people who look older than, I don't know, 15. Right there you're down to like 750 million people as opposed to 7,5 billion people. So you've narrowed it down by 90% just using two very broad criteria. With some research I'm sure you could find some other indicators that correlate with whatever it is they're looking for to reduce it even further. That seems like a far more effective use of resources to me."
"It's stop and frisk on a larger scale, that's all."
Yes I understand that. Perhaps I should clearify that I am against it... but since the government is going to do it regardless of if i'm against it or not I would prefer the government to do it as resource efficiently as possible.
Have you been stopped? I've been stopped. It wasn't a big deal.
"Stopped or detained and interrogated? And yes I have, I've missed connecting flights and been late for other scheduled events because of it so I don't know what you qualify as a ""big deal""."
Were you born in Iran? Here in Washington state we've prevented Americans from crossing the border and detained them simply because of their heritage. Sounds familiar?

"Wtf is a ""tankie""?"
"People who are apologists for Stalin in the full light of knowing exactly what Stalin did.   In the 1930s a lot of people thought the Soviets were idealists and since they didn't really know about the Gulags, we can kind of understand that opinion.  But there are a lot of people who don't just know about the Gulags, but who will defend the idea  of using them to commit genocide. "
"There's called Tankies because of the images of photographic images of Tanks that rolled into Hungry in 1956, and later into Czechoslovakia in 1968.   In 1945 the tanks that took Berlin and Eastern Germany were perceived as  the good guys because they were fighting the Nazis.   But by the late 1950s and then the 1960s, it was clear that the Soviets were not idealists who had just lost their way."
"Tankies that defend China religiously to this day are hilarious to me. I don’t think there’s anything communist about state capitalism and working closely with giant American corporations, but it’s like they’re completely blind to that and still think it’s pre “great leap forward” over there."
Pam Beasley: “They’re the same picture.”
Since the campaign ad didn't seem to be in the article I googled it and I noticed that no one else was reporting on it let alone talking about burning images. Considering this is Newsweek that sets up off some red flags. Sure enough I found the campaign ad and there weren't images of these people burning in it. You literally fell for propaganda as you sit here lecturing about propaganda.
Here's the ad in question.
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/31HHFy8JkoU"">https://youtu.be/31HHFy8JkoU</a>"
Using your dead brother to attack your political opponents? Yikes.
dead brother + 911 + flag + evil brown people
Hitting all the high notes.
The GOP is becoming more cult like everyday.
They’re already a full on cult
The channel even turned comments off. What a bunch of thin skinned idiots.
"That appears to show basically what <a href=""/u/iushciuweiush"" rel=""nofollow"">/u/iushciuweiush</a> said. Nobody is ""burning"" in the ad."
"Sure, there's just repeated images of those people in a fire, surrounded by fire.  But they aren't <em>burning up</em> in the pictures, so according to you, they're not burning."
C'mon man
"Only one image is even shown in the fire, and it’s Ohmar on the unburnt side of a log. The other images are shown projected onto the air. This is a common TV trope. Quit trying to blow it out of proportion."
This is a common TV trope.
"Nah, it's really not.  But I've heard about six different people say this exact same thing today, so great job on those talking points bub"
Talking points? This is a non-issue. Nobody bothers with talking points over nothing. You’re just playing retarded and pretending you’ve never seen any kind of imagery like this.
"The only article I can find even hinting that this was intended to show them burning is newsweek, <a href=""https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/"" rel=""nofollow"">who lean pretty far left, and have mixed factual reporting.</a>"
"But do you want to know what really gives it away? There is not <em>one</em> single mention of them being burned in the actual body of the story. They mention it in the title because they know people will see it but not read the actual story, or bother to look up the ad, and will just accept it without hesitation. And then people like you will play retarded and defend it to the death, just because it looks bad for the Republicans."
mediabiasfactcheck.com
Lol
"I watched the ad, and there are multiple images of Dem politicians in and around a fire.  Fact.  You quibbling about whether or not they are 'burning' is fucking stupid, man.  Absolutely stupid.  The ad was intended to send a message to a certain sort of person and I'm sure it's quite effective at doing so."
Sure enough I found the campaign ad and there weren't images of these people burning in it.
"That’s exactly what we’re talking about here though. Because that’s what the headline suggests. Being “in and around” fire is not the same as “burning.” Look around at the top level comments. It’s been suggested this looks like Nazi propaganda, caused someone to question what happened to compasionate conservatism, and others which suggest this is somehow a heinous commercial which is advocating for burning politicians and political figures."
Hi! I noticed you didn't respond to people showing you the direct ad. Why is that?
Cause he’s an intellectual coward.
"I'm not the person you're responding to, but looking at the link, it seems like they're right. They're not burning in the ad. There's a fire, but the only image shown in the fire at all is Ohmar talking as the image is projected on the unburnt side of a log. Doesn't really seem like he's suggesting she should burn. It's a common trope to show ""visions"" in the fire. The other images aren't even shown in the fire at all."
"Whatever happened to ""Compassionate Conservativism?"""
It’s more fun to play the victim than actually pretend to care about others.
The fact that they had to add that label in the first place says a lot.

"I have to agree. The video doesn’t show anyone violently “burning.” They superimposed a few pictures with footage of the fire to add a contemplative effect. Byrnes is sitting at the fire and is thinking about how “the squad” is ruining America, to make him seem genuinely invested in doing what’s right for the people (and to appeal to conservative voters). Then there’s a shot of the whole squad above him and the fire. "
"There’s no identitarianism or evil message present. It’s literally just another typical ad. Here’s a better one though: <a href=""https://youtu.be/WqnhN2Rzaqc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/WqnhN2Rzaqc</a>"
"Yes, an image of a U.S. Rep with flames imposed onto it in a political ad is definitely going for a ""contemplative effect."" Jesus christ."

"Okay, please explain to me what that is and why I am one? If you’re going to slander me I deserve an explanation. Also, let’s be honest. You never responded to what I wrote truthfully. What is your basis for this claim besides the fact I disagreed with you earlier? It’s bigotry otherwise."
"They’re not burning. Staring at the fire to think is something everyone does. It’s not unusual at all for videos and ads to display imagery coming out from the fire. They represent thoughts. The title is misleading because, again, no one is burning. There is no evil message in this ad. The ad is not saying that these people should burn. It is literally no different than any other ad that says “Hi, I’m genuine. X is ruining the country. Vote me and I’ll fix it.” "
Jesus Christ
"Yeah, seriously."

I see my fellow libertarian is in full support of free political speech
I support free speech.
"However, I personally don't believe that speech can be <strong>truly</strong> free in a situation where there is a threat of violence for those who show their opinion. Especially deadly violence, such as showing an elected official you disagree with as beheaded or burning - to encompass both sides."
"It doesn't matter if the person doing it is a politician, a journalist, a celebrity or anyone else."
"Political violence, including threats of political violence, is authoritarian in nature and has no place under freedom of speech."
I support free speech.
"I don't think you understand what ""supporting free speech"" means.  It means you think people should have the right to say things you disagree with.  You're here explicitly outlining exactly which types of speech you think people ought not to engage in. "
"Political violence, including threats of political violence, is authoritarian in nature and has no place under freedom of speech."
"This is absurd.  Burning effigies has been political speech as long as there have been leaders to burn effigies of.  Which is of course not to mention the fact that ""abstract advocacy for violence"" is protected speech in the US."
"Sounds to me like the person who says ""you can't criticize the president in that way"" is the authoritarian."
"If you are showing an image of political violence as part of your disagreement then what are you actually disagreeing with? You aren't disagreeing with any sort of statement that the person made, you are in fact suggesting that you think that what the opponent said is worthy of violent backlash."
If the response to a political opponent making any sort of point is an image of political violence then that is a direct attempt at dissuading that opponent from exercising their own freedom of speech.
"This is commonplace in authoritarian countries like; China, North Korea, Russia, where political opponents are encouraged not to speak out by the threat of political violence."
"An ordinary person saying ""this shit is fucked up"" has nothing to do with free speech whatsoever."
"an ordinary person saying that political speech is ""fucked up for ANYONE on ANY SIDE to be doing"" is no supporter of free speech rights"
Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak your mind without fear of repercussions from <em>the government</em>.
You and I can criticize each other all day long and that entire exchange has nothing to do with freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech comes into play when <em>the government</em> starts making laws about what people can or cannot say.
"an ordinary person saying that political speech is ""fucked up for ANYONE on ANY SIDE to be doing"" is no supporter of free speech rights"
"you seem to think that the only arena in which ""free speech"" exists is between government and the citizen.  You are wrong."
"If some random stranger doesn't like what you said and tells you it's fucked up, <em>and tells you that nobody should be saying what you said</em>, they are opposed to freedom of speech."
What can I say except you don't have a clue what you're talking about.  
<em>and tells you that nobody should be saying what you said</em>
The only way this would harm freedom of speech is if <em>the government</em> passed a law to this effect.  If some random stranger wants everyone to shut up about Harry Potter that doesn't affect freedom of speech at all because everyone is free to ignore him without consequence.
"FFS, you're dense aintcha? I didn't say anybody's rights were being infringed. I said <em>they were not a supporter of free speech rights</em>"
"When somebody says ""nobody should criticize the president in a way I deem unfit,"" they are an enemy of free speech rights. Period. Just like someone who is pro-life does not support abortion rights, or a gun grabber does not support gun rights.  This is hardly a difficult concept to grasp, even for you. "
What can I say except you don't have a clue what you're talking about
"""nobody should criticize the president in a way I deem unfit"""
"""This should not be allowed"" =/= ""this shit is fucked up.""  But keep moving the goalposts until you're happy."

you were saying?
Why are half the posts here from this asshole
You can downvote and move on.  Or post content yourself...
because he triggers assholes like you and we like that
Because Elranzer and Codefuser invite and allow CTH trolls to brigade this sub.
Make sure you wipe Trump's semen from your lips before you start talking again.
"Leftists, who are the ideological opposite of libertarians, look at this and similar subs as “battlegrounds” where they can sway people, who might be on the fence, away from the right. However, this seldom takes the form of reasoned, open debate. Instead, they constantly post outrage-bait content that demonizes the right, the GOP, etc. in an attempt to prevent people from leaning that way. "
"Now, don’t get me wrong, the GOP and Trump have been horrible for the libertarian cause. But these people are not posting these things to say that “both parties are bad.” They are generally fervent socialists / leftists who despise everything libertarianism stands for."
"I think he feels virtuous spamming anti trump and anti republican “journalism”. I guess some people think turning this board into <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> is a good idea"
Old fragile white guys. What the fuck happened to these people? Embarrassing
ITT: lots of libertarians angry about this being posted to this sub... For some reason
"Cool brigading on libertarian sub.  Why celebrating his freedom of speech, or you just trying to trigger people about how he ""shows them burning""  when that clearly is not what is happening in his video."
"Nah, just exercising my free speech by calling out blatant propaganda."
"Nah, just exercising my free speech by <em>distributing</em> blatant propaganda. "
FTFY
What about showing the behavior of an elected representative is propagandizing?
"Awesome, you you must be proud of this video and why you are distributing as another beacon of free speech.  I doubt you would be pathetic enough to go to a libertarian sub suggesting that we limit free speech"
Free speech doesnt mean a safe space free from criticism.
"It's amazing to see how unaware of yourself you are.  You brigade in a sub to try to prove your point to people who do not give a shit about your position.  you get upvotes from other brigaders, and think that you are making progress on your agenda.  It's pitiful.  I am not looking for a safe space, just calling out how annoying you are.  Just like I don't go to different sport team subs and try to convince them that my favorite sport team is the best, it would be pathetic waste of time.  You are just making the swing voters you think you are convincing to roll their eyes and be reminded how insufferable libs are."
"Just like I don't go to different sport team subs and try to convince them that my favorite sport team is the best,"
Politics isn't a football game dude.
analogy still works meh dude
"For identity politics.  People pick sports teams often based on geographic locations or arbitrary reasons. Therefore, no rational argument could or should make you change sports teams allegiances."
"If you don't think a rational argument can sway someone in any political sense, then you are too rooted into that identity of that party."
"Fine, use who is the best comedian, what is the best movie of all time, what is the best sitcom.  Go you can use that analogy."
"No need for a shit post, by a person who only posts in <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a> pushing identity politics.  It is all off topic posts that do not go along hte subject lines of the sub.  Just like posting this same article in <a href=""/r/DunderMifflin"" rel=""nofollow"">r/DunderMifflin</a>.  Who cares if you agree with it, it makes no sense here."
"Now, if he wanted to open the dialogue about freedom of speech, that would be one thing.  But it is not, it is the same triggering posts the person continues to post in hoping to get people to follow their agenda.  When it is most certainly backfiring and getting people annoyed at libs."
"Best movie/comedian/any form of art is going to be subjective because art is subjective.  There is no ""best"" movie, or ""best"" comedian. It really depends on what you want from a movie or comedian, and it's not necessarily a logical argument. You can't logic something into being funny (but that doesn't mean something logical can't be funny)."
Governing is not the same.  Governance ought to have an actual objective. For the American government the objective is found in the preamble of the constitution: 
"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
"Political discourse is when you have different ideas trying to reach that same goal. Party A says that ""we can reach that goal with these set of policies,"" and Party B says ""actually, these set of policies will help us reach the goal.""  If the policies are steeped in rational thought, then you should be able to follow the line of logic of how policy X helps meet goal Z.  And what can follow is a discussion of why you think X or Y policy will help reach goal Z, and you can bring things into account like scientific studies, or similar historical accounts.  If you're not too rooted into the identity of a party you might even think, ""You know what... I didn't agree with them, but I can see where they're coming from, and where they are trying to go."""
"However, if you're rooted into the identity of the party without caring about the logic behind the policies your party stands for, then of course any rational discussion will fall of deaf ears.  Instead of ""We want policy X for goal Z,"" it becomes ""we want policy X because we want policy X, and policy Y can go fuck itself because I'm not listening."""
Have you ever gone trough the comment section of any CNN video ? Did you check the comments on any AOC or Omar tweet ? I dont know why you are ranting at the guy for sharing an article .
"Because it is a libertarian sub and therefore off topic.  If there is a sub about the office, this post would fit there just as much as it fits here.  It doesn’t have to do with libertarianism."
Trying to limit free speech is comically bad agenda to push on this sub

I always find the blatant spreading of misleading information disappointing yes.  I'm also disappointed in the people that look no deeper than the headlines and blindly join the circle jerk like clapping seals.  I want to have hope for mankind.
The video is posted in these comments.  No need to be hyperbolic.
"I was being hyperbolic claiming this headline is ""misleading""?  Or wanting to have hope for mankind to see through the most obvious of bullshit?  Falling for bullshit and willfully ushering our own demise has happened throughout history."
Losing hope for mankind because people dont agree with a gop campaign ad which has a Muslim congresswoman in flames.
How is it misleading though? Did you watch the video? How dumb do you have to be to blindly defend these evil fucks?
How is it not obviously misleading though? Did you watch the video? How dumb do you have to be to blindly defend these evil fucks?
"It’s sad because you’re the exact type of person Trump targets: someone willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for a sense of belonging. It’s honestly sad. Most of the Trump supporters that I know can at least admit that he’s a retard who they voted for because they liked him more than Clinton. I’ll never understand the type of warped thinking that would lead someone to be so confidently stupid in defending blatant lies, You’re a sheep."
"It’s sad because you’re the exact type of person Democrats target: someone willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for a sense of belonging. It’s honestly sad. Most of the Democrat supporters that I know can at least admit that they are corrupt which they voted for only because orange man bad. I’ll never understand the type of warped thinking that would lead someone to be so confidently stupid in defending blatant lies, You’re a sheep."
How is Colin Kaepernick evil? Do you think someone is evil because they hold a different belief than you do?
Falling for bullshit and willfully ushering our own demise has happened throughout history.
Now THIS is some ironic shit coming from a Redcap lol
I always find the blatant spreading of misleading information disappointing yes
said the trump supporter
If that were true you wouldn't be an avid Trump supporter. Make sure you wipe Trump's semen from your lips before you start talking next time.
It appears you need my consulting services severely.  Turn off the propaganda.  Go outside and take some nice deep breaths.  TDS can be overcame but it's like a bad addiction and kicking the habit will not be easy.
"Accuses People of TDS, yet believes anything Trump says and thinks Trump is always right. Another reason why society does not take Trump Supporters seriously."
Nice straw man you're attacking there.  I could make shit up about what you believe too but I find the exercise pointless.
"Seriously bruh, I know licking Trump's semen turns you on, but please, no one needs to see that."
Bruh
Which part is misleading?
It obviously triggered you
Sick burn bro.
"Because Elranzer is a known CTH tankie sympathizer, Codefuser openly invites CTH scum to brigade this sub, and every other mod is too big of a pussy to do anything about it."
The mod team is completely compromised.  And the subreddit's owner SamLembas is too.  He just squats on this subreddit so no one else can take it and he can hand off control to whichever of his little Chapo buddies gets enough clout.
"Why do you guys upvote the <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/politics</a> recycled propaganda AGuineapig constantly posts?"

You how do you consult people with The_Dumbshit Syndrome?  You bring them to a safe space so they dont have to hear anything negative?
"""There is nothing new about American terrorist attacks against Black and Brown people for the expansion of American imperialism."""
What about the Red man Colin...what about him? Or the Yellow man being enslaved by your master Nike.  How does it feel to profit off the hardship of others?
"Dude is just straight up racist and simple with his color schemes. 
 There are more intelligent people worthy of the podium to tubthump then this retard"
"That’s fair, as long as there is a single other group in the entire world that could be argued to have it worse, it’s immoral to protest police being acquitted for killing unarmed black men on video."
"But it isn't just black men...once again racism of the douchelibs separate a cause into groups for their own control and exploitation.  Fact is police kill unarmed people all the time, and most of the time they are acquitted, but I'm suppose to give more of a fuck because black dudes are being killed over say white dudes?  That's not how it works."
"The data shows that black men are more likely to be killed, even beyond their crime rate and population size.  "
It is undeniably a real problem in our country and one that he felt passionate about.   He consulted with multiple veterans ahead of time and kneeled instead of sitting to show respect for the troops.  He didn’t block a roadway or inconvenience a single person.
"And still his attempt to call attention to a measurable and real problem where called as disrespectful, cost him his livelihood, got him death threats.  And you say that because other groups also have problems there should be no attempt to fix this one."
"Oh, goodie, here comes the pseudolibertarian identity politics bullshit."
What are you doing for any of the above?
Well not being a whore for Nike is one...which honestly is more than this ignorant twat is doing...I'm not profiting off of it.
It’s true. Kaepernick and squad represent existential threat to our freedom. They hate freedom.
Why the hell do libertarians here defend these left wing terrorists.
Here's a participation trophy 🏆 for your troll attempt.

Huh?
What spread of socialism?  Can you define socialism?
"You talking about America?
If so, boy do I have great news for you"
".... you mean like social security, unemployment benefits, Medicare/aid, food stamps... those things that take up 2/3 of federal cash and were passed in the 30s, and are wildly popular programs in America?  Well.... inventing a time machine would be the best move."
I think he means public school and roads
"Education would slow support for socialist policies.  The body of evidence for capitalism, democracy and individual liberty is overwhelming."
"Socialism and democracy are not mutually exclusive. Visit France, or Germany or most of Europe. They are socialist and democratic"
"Europe, France and Germany included, are mixed economies. Not socialist. They dont give the workers rhe means of production automatically."
"They have welfare, but welfare isnt socialism."
You are right they are not socialists but social democracies .
Agreed.  Honestly I think it is pretty clear democracy trends towards socialism is the long term.
Good Order and Discipline
Re-education camps
/s
It isn’t socialism versus democracy. Our country is not a democracy and democracy and socialism easily coexist.
It is socialism versus individual rights. Slowing the spread of socialism is difficult because it is not easy to convince people to take responsibility for themselves.
Who is John Galt?
I think this post needs a better ** working definition** of Socialism. Another thread that will debate some parts or whole of every range of collectivist control of (takes a breath) the means of production.
"Americans often conflate Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy. What most people in the US support is Social Democracy, which is often seen in European countries."
Constitutional Convention
"Striking cultural sites is really not ok. That hurts the culture and history of the regular people. It is likely to just make things worse. Regardless of legalities, it's just not a good look for the ""good guys"" to do."
The only time I would consider it an acceptable option is if they start using the cultural sites as hide outs and staging grounds for weapons. Can't pretend your mosque is a place of worship if it's holding super terrorists and rocket launchers in the basement.
Are we the baddies?
What do you think they’re doing?  The even fly war flags over their mosques. 
Imagine if we flew giant war flags over our churches and cathedrals?
Maybe someone should explain separation of Mosque and State to Iran.
"Oh no, a piece of cloth, we have no choice but to commit war crimes in response"
It's really hard to claim being a neutral site if it's used for war.
Isn’t that a war crime?
Only for pussys /s
"pussies,* bitch"
Trump is immune to all laws domestic and international.
Yea but Trump is the commander in chief.  
"It's so weird how all the constitutionally seperated powers have gone to shit and yet the one power the president has is blatantly in the hands of the military industrial complex, they just only admit it when it sounds nice to say it."
"The trick is to hide the military facilities at cultural sites so it’s a war crime to target them. 1,000 IQ Iranians."
According to who? The panel of crazy leftists we call the UN?
"According to laws and customs of war, such as the Geneva Conventions, which we've agreed to follow."
Then we can withdraw from the agreement.
And lose its protections.
There's a reason nation states agreed to rules of war: unrestricted warfare is incredibly horrific.
I didn't say it was a good idea though.
"Your replies radiate that sentiment, though."
What level of Trump derangement are you on???
"I am not a Trump supporter, but I sometimes defend his actions."
"You're not a supporter of his, you just have his boot so far down your throat that you're suggesting withdrawing from the fucking Geneva Conventions."
I’m just saying that the US could potentially withdraw. Have you read the Geneva Conventions? There might be a clause that libertarians disagree with.
That doesn’t mean we would automatically gain immunity for every war crime committed
How would the UN enforce this?
Kinda messed up when the Pentagon is openly contradicting the commander in chief.  I'm happy they are though.
illegal orders shouldn't be followed.
"The root of the problem is illegal orders being <em>given.</em>  When illegal orders are given, one of three things happens:"
"Option 2 is the most likely scenario, so you wind up stripping your organization down to leaders who are less qualified and more willing to do whatever the president says."
The Pentagon doesn't want to <em>overtly</em> commit war crimes.
Technically this is the pentagon fulfilling its constitutional duty to disobey an unlawful or unconstitutional order
"Are we keeping track on how many times this administration has ""walked back"" a statement like this? I think it would be an interesting stat to keep...for fun."
"Moral issues aside, that’s literally one of the worst ideas I have ever heard in my life."
"""We aren't going to do it as obvious as he is saying it"""
He sooooo has the press wrapped around his finger. How do they not realize that this kind of thing plays right into exactly what he is trying to do?
What is he trying to do? No White House press briefing in over three hundred days.
What is he trying to do?
Fuck with them. Expose them for being partisan and overly dramatic. Example: See his third term comments. He was not being serious but the press acted like a dictator was incoming. He does this on purpose.
No White House press briefing in over three hundred days.
"He is one of, if not the most accessible Presidents in modern history. His hour long runway press conferences, his press conferences with world leaders. Do you really miss the daily press briefing where the press secretary says nothing and no one gets any answers to the questions they have?"
Fuck with them. Expose them for being partisan and overly dramatic.
A President calling for a war crime just to fuck with people is something worth being dramatic about.
"Is this really what you want the government to be doing? Threatening war and war crimes just to ""fuck with people"" is that really all conservatism is at this point, just a way to fuck with people?  How is this possibly acceptable behavior by any politician let alone a President? Whatever happened to dignity and self-respect?  Why do we want politicians acting the retard just to make people upset by how retarded you're acting, how does that help the country at all?"
"Is this really what you want the government to be doing? Threatening war and war crimes just to ""fuck with people"""
"He is not doing it to fuck with people, he is doing it to fuck with the press. Big difference."
Is this really what you want the government to be doing?
"I want my government to STFU and stay out of my life, but that obviously isn't going to happen anymore."
Whatever happened to dignity and self-respect?
"IDK, whatever happened to not labeling eveyone you disagree with a racist, bigot, and nazi? That respect and dignity goes both ways. Trump is a reaction to that garbage, not the symptom. "
how does that help the country at all?
Words versus actions my friends. Who fucking cares what comes out of his mouth if he is getting the job done. And by most measurable metrics he is getting the job done well.
"You know, I hate this. I don't want to defend Trump. I don't really like the guy as a person. But he is effective in what he does."
"You know, I hate this. I don't want to defend Trump."
"But you are, go fuck yourself.  Trump is the symptom of the problem like you say but you are the problem because you condone and support this behavior."
"Trump is your revenge on the world for whatever it did to make you feel weak and insecure, a bully in the White House that you just love to see piss all over everything and everyone you hate, go fuck yourself."
because you condone and support this behavior.
"I do, because you know what? Fuck you and fuck the other side. They have shown that they cannot be trusted. Defending Iran and their regime in the last week has shown that to the world."
Trump is your revenge on the world for whatever it did to make you feel weak and insecure
"LOL, keep telling yourself that while you douse yourself with patchouli oil while sniffing your own farts."
a bully in the White House that you just love to see piss all over everything and everyone you hate
The last President was a fucking pussy in every aspect. I'd rather have this strength than what we had previously.
go fuck yourself

Lol omg yes he’s owning those libs!!!1
"The annoying thing is by the time it's clear it was never a joke, so much has happened you can't hold it against them because you've forgotten what moronic thing they tried to justify"
"But that's the thing. If you pay any attention at all to the daily goings on of Trump, It is immediately clear that it was a joke."
"Yes, so immediately clear he followed up with this"
"They’re allowed to kill our people,” Trump told reporters. “They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way."
So immediately clear kellyanne Conway justified it
"Iran has many military sites, strategic sites, that you may cite that are also cultural sites"
Such a funny joke Kelly. Lol-lyanne lmaonway amirite
"Was it just a prAnk, bro?"
That’s the answer for anything oh he was joking or he was not serious. I honestly have no idea when he is or is not serious. The White House refuses to have any actual press briefings because then ideas or comments from the president or White House would be cemented. It enables gas lighting.
That’s the answer for anything oh he was joking or he was not serious. I honestly have no idea when he is or is not serious.
"Does it seem ridiculous? Like, idk, 55 bombing site because there were 55 hostages? He is joking. It is pretty easy to see. "
"I read somewhere that the big difference when dealing with Trump that liberals and conservatives have, is that liberals take his words seriously but not his actions, and conservatives take his actions seriously and not his words."
The White House refuses to have any actual press briefings because then ideas or comments from the president or White House would be cemented.
"The actual President, not his lawyer, not his press secretary, but Trump himself gives hour long weekly press conferences. Seriously, what more do you want? Name me the last time anything of substance came out of the daily white house press briefing?"
55 bombing site because there were 55 hostages? He is joking.
You'd have to be the dumbest motherfucker on the planet to believe this.
"is that liberals take his words seriously but not his actions, and conservatives take his actions seriously and not his words."
The truth is republicans believe whatever their master tells them to believe

"Just the first one alone, the gas attack happened since 2013. I hope more people would be ok with bombing in response."

"You know, here in Italy while my grandfather and his were under the fascist regime but the axis already started to lose power, many groups of civilians, ""I partigiani"" armed themselves and started doing small raids against fascist/nazi forces, killing lots of generals and soldiers. Do you know what they did for every german soldier they killed? They killed 12 civilians, 10 soldiers, 120 civilians. "
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
"I genuinely hope that you are trolling with your outrageously stupid and illogical comments, but sadly, and I am sad for you, I don't think you are."
"lose power, many groups of civilians, ""I partigiani"" armed themselves and started doing small raids against fascist/nazi forces, killing lots of generals and soldiers. Do you know what they did for every german soldier they killed? They killed 12 civilians, 10 soldiers, 120 civilians."
The fact that you are trying to make a comparison between Trump and Mussolini shows how much of a douche bag you really are. Grow up. Let me guess? He is also Hitler?

So we agree that those who agree with the confederacy should be enslaved?

"The confederates enslaved people, so we should enslave them and their supporters. Or for a more comparable analogy, we should enslave whites because they enslaved others."

Dumbshit much?
Bro get your head checked
Is this satire?
"He's saying something that you should logically agree with though.  After all, if some extreme Muslim destroyed a cultural site belonging to other Muslims.... and you want to use that action to justify Trump doing similar destruction to other cultural sites.  Therefore, weather you accept it or not, you are yourself volunteering to enslave all White people  because slavery once existed.   Not liking this state of affairs does not alter the little conundrum corner you boxed yourself into. "
"As such, you either look like a jack ass believer in stupid or admit you were wrong and move along.  You seem to have picked the stupid option."
we hate what those Muslims do! We hate it so much we're going to do what they do!
America the meek
"Iran has pretty significant religious minorities that do not have their buildings violated and destroyed. These ""muslim countries"" you're talking about are Wahhabi Salafite Sunnis who want nothing but the destruction of God's creatures on Earth."
"Oh, well if somebody else did war crimes then we should be able to too!"
"In Islam there's a concept of Bid'ah, innovation in religion, Saudi Arabia and other orthodox Muslims destroy anything that people start to worship, graves, historic mosques, mecca is devoid of its history thanks to its government."
For Muslims the worldly life is not important its the one to come that's more important
Even if they do that doesn't mean we should sink to their level.
"Slavery isn't actually very libertarian, my dude"
This post is sarcasm dude
"Libs are just shitty we keep getting called pedos and slavers, children lack all the knowledge necessary to make an informed decision to sell themselves into sex slavery so it's not a fair contract. Everyone admits libertarianism only works with excellent and free information flow, you can sell plutonium laced cigarettes provided everyone knows it."
"Selling your kids is per Rothbard though lol, I assume the correlative is buying is too.."
That was actually hilarious.
"Low effort troll.  2/10, try harder."
Is it wrong to break into homes? Is it wrong to assault people? Is it wrong to take things that are not yours? Is it wrong to kill other people? Is it wrong to abduct children? Is it wrong to kidnap and encage people you dislike? If any of these things are actually wrong then it must be said that the police are criminals. They go through out their day doing things that would be considered horrible crimes for anyone else and then pretend to be the good guys. Somehow they act surprised and offended when people dislike them.
three officers were investigated as a result. An Internal Affairs investigation found that over a dozen officers assigned to Metropolitan Division crime suppression duties had falsified information on field-interview cards to identify non-gang members as belonging to gangs. 
...
"Both the LAPD's traffic stops and California's gang database have faced scrutiny. The Los Angeles Times reports that nearly half of the drivers stopped by the division are black, despite blacks comprising only 9 percent of the city's population and the fact that such stops had a low arrest rate. The LAPD announced last fall that it would reduce the number of random stops due to the disparate impact on minorities."
Need 3 identifiers...but gang members already own parts of california and us and tell members not to get tattoos. Was Bloods and Crips now Northerners and Southerners. Fyi LA county has 10m people with 175k gang members so 1.7%? You can hang out and be a associate but not be a member.

This is old news.
"Vote your conscience, my dude. This is how I was in '16, but I'm less convinced of that path now."
"I appreciate the positive reinforcement. Sadly I will be voting with my conscience. I am very worried, maybe unnecessarily so, about the long term affects of this current administration and what another four years would bring or cement. A few of my concerns that trump (no pun intended) me normally voting with my wallet first. "
"Wild foreign policy, more conservative judges being appointed, continued unchecked presidential powers which sets a precedent for any future president, foreign election interference, corruption and emulate clause violations, scary immigration policies, tariffs finally catching up to US economy and popping the economic bubble, voting suppression, people in White House associating with white supremacy. "
It’s not because I think the dems will all be perfect angles. These things are happening right now as we speak and will continue. Even the largest things democrats are proposing could not happen fast and is very doubtful they would be approved in four years. 
I am willing to sacrifice this one election in the hopes of ending the current corruption of the republicans and at the very least this administration. 
Just one guy on the internet two cents.
"Completely reasonable. I will likely vote D as well, depending on who gets nominated. Strangely my thoughts on Trump have improved from existential threat to the republic to a louder version of the same shit. Again you're position was mine probably a year ago, but i think the checks of government have largely worked, fortunately for all of us."
vote libertarian 2020
"Trump isn't a republican. He ran as a republican because that was the only ticket he'd fit in, without risking running against a republican candidate and Hillary."
Voting Trump is directly antithetical to voting for liberty and peace
Vote Hillary. Lol 😂
"Yes.  Hopefully it is Biden, and not Sanders.  "
"Biden is likely a one-term president.  He's a placeholder.  We can get the jackass out of office, and worry about the rest in 4 years."
"Don't play their game, find the best candidate and vote for them."
You are playing their game. They are the same. Vote Libertarian or independent.
Which won’t actually matter. I know I know but it’s the truth. I voted Libertarian in 2016 but it did not matter.
I can't vote for someone who wants to take away my rights.
"New flash, you can’t vote then."
If nothing else I can write in myself.
I disagree with Democrats and find them dangerous to liberty and freedom but Trump is worse. More concerning is all the blind supporters who want freedom and won't recognize we have a tyrant dictator because at least he's Republican.
It depends on who they nominate.  I won't be voting for Bernie or Trump and probably not Warren.  I will consider others.
"And to others..  yes Democrats suck but right now Republicans hold 2 1/2 branches of government.  Republicans also hold considerable power in the states.  Therefore, Democrats are far less of a threat."
*pronoun use was ambiguous
"With exception of Gabbard I don't see Trump being any worse or better than other candidates. A lot of rhetoric, BS promises and more of the same."
Yes absolutely Trump and the Republicans have taken the position that the president is a king above any and all authority 
"Anyone claiming to be a “libertarian” and a Trump supporter is lying to you or incredibly stupid, probably both"
So your voting democrat. That's exactly what the authoritarians want
"Both the current Parties are the SAME! Trump may be a dick but our Country is not run by one man, in many ways he’s a puppet"
"I’m voting Independent and for an individual who represents my way of thinking , as always"
Nah. You’re not a libertarian.

"Oof, backfire"
Me next!!
I didn't vote for anyone in '16 and probably won't in '20(I don't think I'm even registered).
"Honestly, Trump is more likely to get my vote than anyone else.  I can't vote for any of the Democrats because they're either crazy or stupid.  I might be able to stomach the libertarian or Constitution party candidate, depending on if they're going to give us another fucking moron again or not."
"I'm reasonably satisfied with the way Trump has handled himself.  Of course, all of this is contingent on him not starting another war in the Middle East.  That would certainly blow my support right quick."
And trump is not stupid??
Trump is a billionaire and President.
"If he's stupid, he's damn good at it."
Being rich does not make you smart
Do you believe in democracy?
"I do. I am currently more worried about the erosion of it by the current republicans then anything else. I have four main concerns that worry me over my wallet and taxation, which can be adjusted later. "
The judges being placed by this administration are often far right conservatives. Which will support morality based laws. Many are life time appointments. 
The unchecked presidential power. Currently republicans and the president support total power with no checks and balance. 
The republicans continued attacks on voting rights.
Basic corruption of the government. I know that dems have in the past not always been better. Currently they are the only ones pushing legislation to end future corruption.
"I agree with most of what you're saying, but most of his judicial appointments are actually fairly solidly originalist and/or textualist rather than ""conservative"" which end of itself is somewhat of a misnomer judicially. I agree with your inten and complainta, but in actuality hyper-textualist is the best possible thing we could hope for right now"
It goes both ways though... (not a tranny joke)... Dems will appoint Social Justice Warrior/Activist judges as well... Sotomayor is about as far left as you can get without hitting the Far Right judges when you circumnavigate the political globe...
Both sides of the POTUS have virtually unchecked power. Congress refuses to step up and actually stop POTUS from making declarations of “Conflict”... which amounts to the last 18-19 years of War... they don’t want to be on record making that decision so they hide it under “War on Terror.” 
I think Trump is an idiot if he escalates with Iran. Which I know he will. But “now” the Dems have an issue with the actions in the Middle East after getting us involved in Syria and the destruction of Libya? BS on both sides because they both want endless wars to appease their MIC donors. 
"The left has no problem keeping dead people on the voting rolls and people that have moved and not cleaned their rolls up. I don’t really see how removing dead people and people who no longer live in the district or state from their respective rolls is an issue. I’m in favor of Voter ID, using biometric security (privacy laws do come into play though) while making Voting Day a National Holiday. Also the citizenship question as you shouldn’t be able to wield more political power by bringing in illegals/undocumented people to gain Congressional Seats or Federal Funds like they’re currently doing. "
"Dems aren’t trying to end corruption. They’re making it look like they are. Meanwhile they gerrymander districts, eliminate personal freedoms, jail people who are poor/minority, etc just as much as Reps do. "
Both sides are shite but no one wants to believe “Both Sides” are doing the same thing because people want to protect their criminal and criticize the other side’s criminal.
"I’m voting libertarian, but would you rather have capitalist, genuinely freedom preferring Trump or a crazy socialist who’s goal is to confiscate your property, guns, and rights?"
Weird way of framing a choice dont you think ?
"""Would you rather have a genuinely caring but slightly misguided Ted Bundy or a crazy dangerous psychopath   like John Allen Muhammad who's goal is to kill you   ?"
Trump is neither free market capitalist nor freedom preferring.
Anyone in commercial real estate in NYC is part of a corrupt cabal. Nepotism and cronyism are rampant. Developers renege on agreed-upon contracts.
"Freedom-preferring Trump? Are you high? The guy wouldn’t know the NAP if his Double Double was wrapped in it. He said take the guns first, “due process later.” That sounds like someone who prefers freedom to be his special brand of Constitutional ignorance."
"We don’t have free markets. We have illusory freedom, just enough to keep those of us who care from going nuts."
"I’m voting for Bernie. He is strongly anti-war. He knows exactly how broken our healthcare system is, and as much as I hate socialized healthcare, per capita costs are less in every industrialized nation with it- that sure as shit sounds like a net positive."
"Maybe we have to go left to return to center. It’ll be a long, hard slog through whatever the fuck Trump’s government is followed by a long, hard slog through whatever comes afterward. We’ll never have anything remotely libertarian, so we’re always going to have to heavily compromise."
I am going to stop calling myself libertarian. One cannot be libertarian and vote for any Repub/Democrat without some degree of ideological discrepancy. I am someone with libertarian leanings.
"Who passed more gun restrictions, Obama or Trump?"
Also could you define socialism for me
Think you dropped this... /s.

I didn't call her a communist. Watch the link. She is a capitalist and says so in the video. She said it hurt her being a capitalist because the Democrat Party is heavily Socialist/Communist.
"Oh okay, so strawmen it is"
Who is a communist?

Are you feeling ok? (O.o)

"Oh boy, 88 usernames posting in <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a> now? Just yesterday we had triple parantheses guys being upvoted."
Amazing
"88 usernames posting in <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a> now?"
They were always there. The surge is from Libertarians eventually going there themselves. 
I've watched several regular users here slowly transition into outright Alt-Right/Neo-Nazis over the years.
Only progressive leftists call other people racists instead of combating their ideas. You see 88 and call the user a racist just because they are against the DNC.... you’re embarrassing yourself by taking up arms with those that shout people down and cancel them over something only you and other leftists see as a dog whistle. Grow up
"The terms were later adopted by white supremacists and neo-nazis, white nationalists and identitarians, members of the far-right and alt-right, the most widely used variation being, ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" Another less commonly used variation is: ""Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth."" It is sometimes combined with 88, as in ""14/88"" or ""1488"". The 8s represent the eighth letter of the alphabet (H), and ""HH"" stands for ""Heil Hitler"". This can also be a reference to Lane's 88 Precepts, which when combined with ""14"" refer to Lane's white supremacist neo-pagan religion, Wotanism."
Again - you’re just embarrassing yourself by claiming that everyone with 88 in their username who you disagree with is a Nazi. 
Idiot progressive leftists shout down people and call them Nazis when they disagree. Libertarians debate ideas when they disagree. 
Grow up.
Gaslighting doesn’t work me.
You are the one gaslighting by calling people Nazis without any justification. So fucking blind to your own bullshit
Here we go again... So whats this new nazi symbol triple parantheses?? Thats a Nazi dog whistle now too??

I mean you’re clearly far right considering you’re putting the 14 words in your username. 
I’ll be responding to your posts with those links from now on.
"I disagree personally. As I see it compared to any of the alternatives, Trump is the least likely to become a full-on gun grabber, and the least likely to try to nationalize healthcare. He ain't great by any stretch, but when the Democrat alternatives are sliding toward socialism and losing our rights, or careening at Mach 10 towards socialism and losing our rights, I'll take Trump."
It was shot down
"This piece relies on bullshit analysis from the Fraser institute, who is a mouthpiece for whatever industry is willing to pay them for results.  "
"The first objection promises greatly increased wait times, despite the fact that this isn't actually the case in countries with similar systems."
"The second objection talks about taxes having to go up, but strangely completely forgets to mention the immense savings that would come from no longer having to fund health care personally.  And not just for citizens, but for businesses.  Not only would taxpayers be paying far less out of pocket, the businesses who currently provide the vast majority of health care dollars would also be relieved of those expenses."
Pretty much a shitty piece from top to bottom.  2/10
"Individualist has his head so far up his ass, he doesn't care posting false articles where the Libertarian position is eviscerated in the comments."
<strong>Libertarians do not have an answer against universal healthcare</strong>.
"The second objection talks about taxes having to go up, but strangely completely forgets to mention the immense savings that would come from no longer having to fund health care personally. And not just for citizens, but for businesses. Not only would taxpayers be paying far less out of pocket, the businesses who currently provide the vast majority of health care dollars would also be relieved of those expenses."
Sounds like you're a big fan of universal healthcare. Imagine my shock.
"Sounds like you are a fan of fallacious arguments, Birdpear.  Imagine my shock."
"I'm only for whatever provides maximum utility with minimum administrative cost, and our current system is a fucking dog.  I am completely unimpressed with arguments that moving in the other direction would have any positive benefit for citizens whatsoever, due to the nature of the health care market."
"A more appropriate and respectable response from you would have admitted that while taxes rise, citizens and their businesses would be relieved of the direct costs they pay today, which are considerable.  Do you deny this?  Truly interested to hear you address this specific point."
"I am completely unimpressed with arguments that moving in the other direction would have any positive benefit for citizens whatsoever, due to the nature of the health care market."
So you do favor more government control of healthcare! No wonder you're voting for the Democrats.
"you would have admitted that while taxes rise, citizens and their businesses would be relieved of the direct costs they pay today, which are considerable. Do you deny this?"
"Of course it's true that if the government takes over healthcare and provides it for ""free"" private healthcare costs would go away and you would pay with taxes instead. Libertarians don't deny that. The question is whether the benefits from eliminating those direct costs outweighs the harm from the increased taxes. More importantly, comparing universal healthcare to our current terrible system is misleading, as libertarians don't want to keep our current system. The better question is which would be more efficient, government run healthcare or a libertarian market-based system?"
So you do favor more government control of healthcare! No wonder you're voting for the Democrats.
"I can envision a wholly different universe, in which a wholly private health care system might work.  In our <em>current reality,</em> it would not.  There is no method for moving from our current system to the one you champion, for many reasons, not the least of which being that practically nobody wants us to at all and that there are zero examples that can be pointed to of such a system functioning, let alone to a greater degree than our current system."
"Of course it's true that if the government takes over healthcare and provides it for ""free"" private healthcare costs would go away and you would pay with taxes instead. Libertarians don't deny that."
"Lol, okay, you simply do every single thing possible to <em>minimize</em> discussion of that.  The piece you linked doesn't mention it at all.  They have a whole section about how taxes are going to go up dramatically and strangely seem to have forgotten to mention in that section that the amount paid out to insurers and providers by individuals and businesses would drop to zero."
"It's a fundamentally dishonest presentation of the situation, and you know it.  A more honest argument would put that front and center, because that's a key component of the proposal - and by far the most attractive one to voters, which you also know."
The question is whether the benefits from eliminating those direct costs outweighs the harm from the increased taxes.
"Good news!  We have ENDLESS amounts of evidence from other countries that the answer here is yes. There are also many studies showing that a switch to that system here in the US would result in lower costs for everyone.  So that question has a lot of evidence to provide an answer.  Just, not evidence you like, at all."
"More importantly, comparing universal healthcare to our current terrible system is misleading, as libertarians don't want to keep our current system. The better question is which would be more efficient, government run healthcare or a libertarian market-based system?"
"How can we judge this?  Your proposed system is a myth.  It doesn't exist anywhere and never has.  There is no evidence to show that your proposed system would be superior, at all.  Your proposed system does nothing to address a wide variety of problems with our current healthcare system and would in fact exacerbate many of them."
"Dude, the next two decades are going to be pretty fucking difficult for you on this topic, because the chances of the US moving towards a system you favor are pretty much zero.  And I gotta tell you, this is in large part because the arguments of those who propose it - including your own - are half-baked at best and laughable at worst.  This isn't the fault of the people who promote a different system than yours; it's YOUR fault for having a shitty argument and for championing a shitty system"
This is some grade A bullshit.
One: The Knowledge Problem
"The reason why the single-payer system will produce long-term negative consequences for society is because it primarily ignores the laws of supply and demand. The laws of supply and demand are based upon the principle of scarcity, which is the gap between limitless wants and limited resources. The same principle applies to the single-payer system."
"Prices are precise signals used to determine the volume of production needed in an industry. Under a single-payer system, there will be no price system, and this lack of prices will distort the knowledge required to determine the quantity of medical services that needs to be produced."
"Lol. The medical industry as a whole features ungodly amounts of profits, let alone the pharmaceutical industry.
See all the damage the Sackler family has done as evidence of that."
"Every other first world country has successfully implemented a single payer system, without a single case of a country's people being so unsatisfied with their service that they ""go back"" to a free market solution.  By arguing America cant possibly accomplish what everyone else has, we are just saying that Americans are not as capable as the rest of the world. I have to agree. We cant possibly solve problems that others already have."
"Lets face it, America is stupid to manage what everyone else has. Instead we should try something nobody managed and would require more intellectual capabilities."
"So far it looks like no U.S. casualties at least, though it seems some Iraqis were killed, which is unfortunate. This could be a good opportunity to de-escalate with all parties saving face. Trump could pull all troops out of Iraq. He wouldn't have to frame it as a retreat. Iraq asked us to leave and Trump did repeatedly criticize having so many troops deployed in other nations. Iran got their show of force. So they can claim they achieved their revenge. It would be the best thing for the citizens of the U.S., Iraq, and Iran."
"I don't expect it to play out like this, though. Ego and machismo will certainly get in the way, but it's a nice thought."
Iraq asked us to leave
Some in Iraq have asked us to stay. Notably the minority and Kurds like us to ensure the Shia dont run the minorities over.
"They also haven't formalized it, in large part because they can't. The prime minister resigned following anti Iranian demonstration and a new prime minister needs either the minority Sunni or kurds (either or both) to sign on effectively. "
There also serious harm from pulling out simply because someone launches rockets at you. Pull that and any anti group just launchs rockets at you to remove you.  Its the wrong precedent to set for the purposes of world politics as it makes allies suddenly question your abilities.
"I'm not saying we should leave because Iran launched missiles. I'm saying we should leave because we should have left a long time ago. We stayed, ostensibly, to help train Iraqis and to fight ISIS. That had been put on hold with the increased tension with Iran. The only reason to have troops in Iraq at this moment is to show Iran that were not afraid of them. That's a very stupid reason. We don't want a war. They don't want a war. They already said they have no intention of further retaliation unless store U.S. takes further action. Even if we do plan to continue covert action against them there no reason to have troops sitting there in harm's way unless we plan on having a full scale ground war. This is, as I said, the perfect time to deescalate the situation."
"But leaving now will embolden Iran. The world doesn't care why you say you leave, it cares why it thinks you left. You pull out after the other guy blinks. Brinkmanship, stupid policy for a stupid species (humans.)"
See Turkey/Syria kurd issue.
We should not be the world police. American teenagers shouldn't die defending Iraq or Israel
"No, we are just allies to a lot of people, people who allisnce is largely beneficial economically. Abandoning them during tension packed times or when they are in danger is a short sighted move."
aka big brother
"So we should leave troops just sitting there so they don't feel emboldened? Let them claim a small victory. Everyone who matters will know that this wasn't a capitulation by the U.S. Everyone knows we could mop the floor with them. It's just not in our best interest to do so, or even to make it look like we want to."

Do Trump's balls taste salty our sour on your tongue Dhaerrow? Color you an idiot.
As salty as you are after the USN parked a Tomahawk up your terrorist pal Soleimani's ass.

Hahaha what holiday?  It's a week into January.
"Well, January 6th was National Cuddle-Up Day and today is National Bobblehead Day. Didn’t you know all CBP officers are avid bobblehead collectors who are desperately in need of some cuddle time?! SMH..."
"And the airstrike happened 2 days after Christmas and 4 days before New Year's Eve, which is the timeshare this article is referencing."
"Published 1:08 a.m. ET Jan. 7, 2020"
"WASHINGTON – After the airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, there were reports that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol detained dozens of people at the Blaine, Washington, port of entry over the weekend."
"The airstrike was on January 3rd, and the weekend they are referencing is January 3-5.  So you're flat-ass wrong on both counts."
"If you're going to lie, pick something that isn't easily disprovable."
"I was mistaken about the date. I stand corrected. That being said, be less of a dick. This sub doesn't need any more of that."
"Oh fuck off.  You lied, you got called out on it, lie less next time."
Hope you nothing but the best.
Oh fuck off
Why are you lying?
Already corrected in another comment. I was mistaken. Enjoy your night.
"Trump is going to use the fact that no one was killed/injured and the damage was comparatively minor to justify further military action.  He won't take the option to de-escalate, he'll argue that Iran showed its attacks were incompetent and therefore we should continue using our military against them as we have already."
Of course if someone had been killed that would have been a perfect excuse for more military as well.
"So either way, you think he would “escalate” the issue and condemn him for it? This whole thought process doesn’t sound fair or objective in nature. I guess we’ll see how true your prediction is tomorrow, when he makes his statement."
"I will condemn him for any escalation, correct"
That’s not exactly what I asked. 
"So either way, <strong>you think he would “escalate”</strong> the issue and condemn him for it?"
"You’re of the opinion that he started the conflict, so to you the burden is on him for “escalating” the issue. That’s fine. "
"The problem is that you’re not even considering the idea that he might back down. So again, either way, you think he’d “escalate” the issue and either way you would condemn him for it. "
You’re not considering any alternative decision that he might make and you’re not giving him any space to make a decision that you wouldn’t totally hate him for. That’s all I’m pointing out. 
"Out of curiosity, what would you think if he backed down?"
Yes I think Trump has decided to escalate no matter what and I will condemn him if I'm right.
If he does something else I'll be wrong and I'll have a different opinion maybe
"If his statement tomorrow shows that you’re wrong, let me know what you think. "
"If his statement tomorrow shows that you’re right, then you’re free to rant about him to me if you want. "
"Meanwhile, I’m just glad there weren’t any US casualties."
"In my opinion, when we’re dealing with weapons of war, the likes of which no other man has controlled, it’s fair to worry about the worst. Especially when the man with that control has just utilized his power in an incredibly brash, and unprecedented way. And extra, super especially when the man is already known to be unknowledgable, violent, and impulsive"
"Well yeah, worrying in these situations is always warranted. I disagree with most people on this subreddit but I’ll openly admonish anyone that thinks handling devastating military weapons and using them in a foreign nation is no big deal. In this case, Soleimani’s death was actually premeditated though. Trump’s administration has been urging him to get rid of the guy for months. When they attacked the embassy, Trump went along with it. So at least, in this case, we can say that Trump’s actions weren’t impulsive, but rather retaliatory in nature. We can sort of count our blessings in that and the fact that it doesn’t seem like we suffered any casualties from their recent attack. We’ll see how everything unfolds tomorrow though."
"I personally won’t take any solace in that. Judging from the historical record, the way he carried out this strike will likely lead to increased aggression from our opponents, and weaken our political capital on the global stage. "
"If Trump wanted to kill this guy, he should have done it on the battlefield. Not on another sovereign countries soil, without their knowledge, while making them unwitting accomplices. That’s just poor state craft, and it will absolutely increase the risk our soldiers face in the region"
Don’t take solace in that. That wasn’t what I was saying.
His statements don't mean jack shit at this point.
If he follows up on it then he can get some benefit of the doubt 
Why would you believe a word he says at this point?
"Hey, so what are your thoughts?"
You predicted that — 
Trump is going to use the fact that no one was killed/injured and the damage was comparatively minor to justify further military action.
"Besides sanctions and mentioning NATO, I think his statement so far has proved your prediction wrong. Unless perhaps, you think there’s more to this NATO proposition than simply involving them in future dealings with Iran. Is this as a whole at least better than what you initially thought? Let me know."
"Yes I'm happily wrong so far about military actions.  Trump's 'victory lap' of declaring he got Iran to 'back down' instead of graciously accepting the gesture was typical Trump but I don't think that will provoke Iran, they aren't as insecure.  The sanctions I'm more concerned about, if Trump is saying Iran backed down (which is behavior we want) then why are we punishing that behavior with sanctions?"
"If Trump really thinks Iran is backing down then he should be offering things to encourage more of that behavior, not punishing them for it."
"That’s good to know! I don’t understand what you mean by “graciously accepting the gesture,” unless I’m missing something. They shot our military bases with missiles even if they intended to miss anyway. It’s like gently scratching someone on the arm — it’s still sort of mean. I largely think this whole thing is really a result of Trump using deterrence to discourage greater violence, and it seemed to work. That’s why he’s not furthering military presence. He’s not as war-hawkish in this respect as other people say. "
You raise a good point though. Why the sanctions? Weren’t we already punishing them economically? I can only hope Iran moves toward a brighter future from here on out.
"I don’t understand what you mean by “graciously accepting the gesture,” unless I’m missing something. "
"It would be something like as opposed to saying ""Iran backed down"" which implies that they're weak or were forced into it you could say ""Iran choose to not escalate and we will work with them to find a peaceful resolution to our differences"" or something like that."
"I largely think this whole thing is really a result of Trump using deterrence to discourage greater violence, and it seemed to work. "
"It hasn't worked at all in the larger picture, without the nuclear deal Iran doesn't have a clear picture of what the less confrontational route will bring them in terms of sanction relief and other key objectives it has. Iran is being told that it must rely on confrontational methods, including force, to get what it wants because the US is uninterested in diplomacy unless Iran totally submits to US demands."
"I would like to hear how many missles were intercepted by patriot missles before drawing conclusions. 
  Imagine if almost none were shot down. that alone would give US stratagists pause."

"Well yes, if you're a warhawk (or in a politically compromised position) and intend to start a war, the circumstance is ""so far so good""."
Trump is for peace! I love him!
Ah yes the old Japanese intern treatment. Rich!
What an affront to those who actually endured that. You can't be serious.
Edit: F-ing auto correct...
What an affront to those who actually endured that.
Exactly. How can anyone support reopening that dark chapter of American history?
You can't be serious.
"Oh, you do support reopening that dark chapter in American history"
No. But asking some questions does not equal internment camps. 
"I'm sorry innocent people were delayed, but this is not an unreasonable response, considering current events."
I'm sorry innocent people -<del>were delayed</del>
Had their due process violated on grounds of racial discrimination*.
Stop white washing it redcap. Stop defending Authoritarianism
You really think the internment camps before didn’t start with these same questions?
During military action.... people connected to a political adversary are vetted during boarder crossing. Does no one remember 911? I still get my asshole checked on the way through tsa
It is unreasonable to claim that the US citizens who were detained are connected with a political adversary. They’re connected with the US.
"Also, what<em>about</em> the TSA? Libertarians are no fans of the TSA or the ineffective security theater they perform. Can we get back to the topic we started with?"
"Had a colleague in 2015 who immigrated to ny from iran. He said whenever he went to visit his family there were questions asked by default about what his business was traveling to Iran.
He didnt really complain about it just stated matter of factly thats what happens when you travel travel to Iran."
Wonder what “inappropriate questions” are? Cause that’s easy to claim offense these days. 
7+ hours would suck though.
It would be impossible to give any accurate anthropogenic percentage to the fires; they've occurred forever.  
Imagine the Dust Bowl in the United States in today's situation. It would be blamed on climate change.  
"Although many of us truly believe in climate change, it erodes credibility to blame specific situations on it."
Imagine the Dust Bowl in the United States in today's situation. It would be blamed on climate change.
"The Dust Bowl was as bad as it was literally because of human action.  A naturally caused drought combined with over plowing of farmlands caused massive amounts of lose dirt to be carried into the air by winds.  Farming in that type of terrain still causes dust storms today, its just managed better because we understand how it works."
"I don't know why climate deniers keep bringing up the Dust Bowl as proof extreme weather conditions are unrelated to human activity, its as if they don't understand a God Damn fucking thing they are talking about and have to rely on easily digestible bullet points that don't invite critical thinking."
"I can't imagine what you people would be like during the Dust Bowl when someone suggests that hey maybe we should manage the soil better, ensure conservation of moisture, change our crop rotation, etc.  Would you holler and scream that crop rotation and soil moisture levels are just bullshit science being used as an excuse by people who want to control your lives?"
Dust bowl was certainly anthropogenic; I agree.  
Have you heard climate deniers bring up the Dust Bowl? I am not a climate denier FWIW.
"I have, sorry for making that assumption about you and reacting the way I did my frustration got the better of me"
I think the point of raising the Dust Bowl is that it's not largely some general trend in the climate but rather specific issues locally that have actual solutions that can be implemented locally even if they aren't politically popular. 
"An example of this would be the CA wildfires - US fire policy is fucked and the solution - 'just let it burn' is unpopular still among big segments even of environmentalists.  In addition to that there are policies in CA that prevent making cities more dense+making any kind of construction difficult so people are building out into areas that naturally burn all the time.   These policies when combined are probably well over 90% of the problem if not 99%.  Yet, it's a lot easier to blame some diffuse issue no one can do anything about e.g. Global Warming - that way no one has to be offended and everyone can go on pretending like the policy they cherish isn't harming people."
"When it's a local problem everywhere is a global problem, but it's not just a local man made problem combined with a natural event.  Humans are fundamentally changing how climate works on a global level."
"During the Dust Bowl you could say the drought was wholly natural and wasn't contributed to by mankind the way turning over lots of dirt and making it easy for the wind to blow was. However now, we can measure the specific contribution mankind makes in droughts by measuring things like the mean global temperature over time."
We can look at historic weather or climate powers and say that droughts for example are worse than they were before on average due to humans raising global temperatures.
"So no it's not just bad local policy combined with bad luck  weather, there is a fundamental change in climate on a global scale caused by humans"
"I don't think so.  I think it's bad local policy that's been decades in the making that, when the chickens come home to roost, then gets blamed on GW.   Western forests are too dry for wood to rot, so what happens is that over a century of fire suppression policy has led to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/11/27/trumps-right-about-californias-fires-it-wasnt-climate-change-two-new-california-laws-prove-it/#7462213c22e3"" rel=""nofollow"">huge fuel loads</a> nearly everywhere.   The Indians before white men came used to burn over the forests every few years.  We've been actively supressing fires for over a century and the fuel load is just ridiculous.  So fires come along like they should, but are vastly more intense than is 'natural' and it's all blamed on GW and not on a century of bad fire policy and resistance to clearing areas of trees or even small fires.    It is at least 90% of the problem as the consensus of scientists looking at this aspect agree.   Australia I don't know as much about so I won't speak to what their policies are.   Really what it seems like currently is that supporters of GW are so desperate for confirmatory evidence that they swallow the most shallow, surface evidence imaginable. Californian, and Western fires aren't so much a product of GW as they are bad local policy, laws, and land use that makes them much more destructive than they ever have been before."
"An example of this would be the CA wildfires - US fire policy is fucked and the solution - 'just let it burn' is unpopular still among big segments even of environmentalists. In addition to that there are policies in CA that prevent making cities more dense+making any kind of construction difficult so people are building out into areas that naturally burn all the time. These policies when combined are probably well over 90% of the problem if not 99%. Yet, it's a lot easier to blame some diffuse issue no one can do anything about e.g. Global Warming - that way no one has to be offended and everyone can go on pretending like the policy they cherish isn't harming people."
"I agree WHOLEHEARTEDLY that West Coast urban planning without planning is making wildfires increasingly costly. There's more expensive shit for fires to destroy now. But what is making these fires larger and more frequent? Santa Ana winds aren't caused by climate change to be sure. But repetitive droughts are being caused by changing ocean patterns which are attributable to climate change, and creating the feedback to cause more of it."
"What's making them larger is fuel on the ground.   Used to be that small fires would smoulder through the brush every year or two and burn out fuel, kill off saplings and brush, etc.   But since fire suppression became policy, fires are put out before they do so, and the vegetation grows and dies but just lies on the ground.  I've been in some forests where the duff (pine needles) is more than four feet thick on the ground which is decades of accumulation.   When that burns as it inevitably does it blasts the soil down to bedrock and makes for extremely hot and intense fires"
Imagine the Dust Bowl in the United States in today's situation. It would be blamed on climate change.
"No, it would be blamed on stupid practices being practices. See the aquifer issue which is never climate change except in strawman."
A huge point of the Dust Bowl is how it was made way worse by lack of crop rotation by humans.
"you can't blame the wildfire on climate change, but you can much of the intensity."
Imagine the Dust Bowl in the United States in today's situation.
you mean that massive anthropogenic natural disaster? Seems like an odd comparison to draw...
It would be impossible to give any accurate anthropogenic percentage to the fires; they've occurred forever.
Why are the current brushfires in Australia so devastating? Because they're getting more and more difficult to fight.
"Why are they getting more difficult to fight?
Because Australia's fire season is starting to overlap with the fire season in the Western US. Both countries traditionally share custody of firefighting equipment."
"Why are the fire seasons on opposite sides of the planet starting to line up? Climate change is having an impact on precipitation, heat, and wind due to changing ocean currents in both places."
Climate change didn't cause the brushfires. But it's making them much more difficult to manage.
"Climate change isn't just amplifying this problem which used to be manageable. It's changing the climate in the Middle East creating a drought that led to civil unrest (Arab Spring) that we're still dealing the aftershocks from (Syrian Civil War, Libyan failed state, refugee crisis in Europe)."
Cunts
And they’re right
"13% are started deliberately, and 37% are suspicious. That means 31,000 Australian bushfires are either arson, or suspected arson, <strong>every year.</strong>"
"<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50400851"">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50400851</a>"
That leaves half of fires not as arson..
"more importantly, it's <em>every year</em> weird that the fires are so bad this year right?"
"It's impossible to 100% determine how much is climate change and how much other variables aligning up, but it is certain that it exacerbates the issue."
"To be fair, I am being borderline pedantic, this is obviously used for pushing the 'skeptic' propaganda and they aren't interested in the facts."
Yep
Their leaders are correct to take a measured approach that does not tank the economy.
"Additionally the solution to a changing climate that has been changing for millions of years and will continue to do so for millions more is to adapt. That means quick changes that result in immediate improvements. If brush fires are common in an area, don’t build in those areas. That will give you much faster results than attempting to change global climate."
"In California you have people building homes in areas where fires have been common for centuries then trying to blame global warming for burning their house down. I am not as familiar with Australia, so I don’t know if something similar is happening there or not."
"If the climate never stops changing due to ever increasing emissions, you never stop paying the cost of adaption."
"We need a steady transition, but the governments current is putting zero pressure on large areas of the economy that need to start the gradual transition now. The longer we put it off, the more costly it is."
That is patently false. The US and many other countries are hitting many of their emissions targets. Pressure already exists. None of that will have an impact at all for decades if not centuries if ever.
Immediate change from a climate standpoint is impossible. If we stopped every single source of carbon emissions no matter the impact on our society it would likely be 50+ years before any measurable change in climate is seen. We know this because it has taken that long to get here.
We must be taking quick steps like maybe move out of areas that like to catch on fire. Seems like a no brainer to me.
"Climate has always changed and will never ever ever eeeeevveeeer stop changing no matter what we do. To think otherwise flies in the face of 100% of all climate science in existence. Our approach to climate change should not be try to change the climate, it should be adapt our behaviors to the changes as they come."
It is hotter now than a few hundred years ago but guess what it will be cooler again in the future regardless what we do emissions wise. If in 1000 years we are completely carbon neutral and another ice age starts like all the ones we have seen in the past millennia should we crank up the coal burning power plants again to change the climate or maybe adapt our behavior to the new climate?
"Some industries are transitioning such as energy and personal transport in a big part due to dumb luck that renewables, storage and electric motors seem to have inherent advantages."
"But is there any indication that air travel, shipping, agriculture, steel and concrete manufacturing are showing any significant signs of reducing emissions in line with the Paris targets? "
Of course the climate has natural variation over vast periods of time. But 4 degrees of warming by 2100 is way too quick to be countered by natural changes and it will not stop at 4 degrees in 2100. We can’t keep adapting to that speed of change.
"Future natural changes (long after we have reaching net 0 emissions) would likely be slow enough that adaption is more viable, but we may want to consider ghgs to counter any hypothetical large cooling effects.
It doesn’t matter what’s ‘natural’ but what’s best for human prosperity."
Australia bushfire is controlled by the Indian Ocean but they have a severe drought issue thats been prolonged.
That will give you much faster results than attempting to change global climate.
The damage being caused to climate is something which will outpace our ability to adapt. Biodiversity in the oceans is shrinking and as a result these ecosystems are collapsing. 
Rising water temps plus increased CO2 dissolved in water means coral bleaching and ecosystem collapse.
Rising water temps plus increased agricultural runoff means horrific red tide in Florida that makes beach towns nearly uninhabitable for months at a time - unless you like the smell of ammonia and rotting fish. 
"The loss of coral reefs and warm water fish population means collapse in the oceanic population of apex predators (sharks, dolphins) and means that we now have way too fucking many squid and jellyfish."

"Not every fire was started by an arsonist, and every fire (regardless of how it starts) will burn easier and quicker due to droughts and abnormally dry conditions caused by........."
climate change.
"They burn easier because they've outlawed corridor/break burns during the winter which reduces the severity of brush fires. But you know, ""it's climate change bro"""
"Dude you can come up with any excuse you want but there's no denying that longer, hotter, and dryer seasons make conditions that much easier for fires to start and spread out of control."
"There is a direct link between climate change and these fires, that does not mean it is the only cause so throwing out all these excuses is entirely missing the point"
"Says the guy making any excuse as to why man made climate change is responsible. Goes both ways. Mines just backed up by the actual facts. There were hotter seasons in Oz in the early 1900s than there are right now. The climate change lobby isn't about environmentalism, it's about government overreach."
There were hotter seasons in Oz in the early 1900s than there are right now. 
According to the Australian government the country has experienced a  rapid increase in average annual temperatures since the 1990s and before that.

"Do you have any alternative statistics? The source you gave me just as a bunch of charts, no numbers, no sources, no methodology for how those charts were made, and most of those charts end in the mid 90s or earlier."

Sorry you don't get any extra good boy points for sweating your ass off in a desert while someone fucks your wife.
No there isn't. Climate change doesn't mean sparks just appear and light everything up.
That's not what I said and you know it. You're being deliberately retarded because you can't address the point honestly.
"There's no denying that longer, hotter, and dryer seasons make conditions that much easier for fires to start and spread out of control."
"This is a fact, its as basic as trying to light a wet log vs lighting a dry one.  Neither a wet or dry log will spontaneously catch on fire but its definitely easier for fires to start or be started with one vs the other including natural fires."
The fact that I have to explain this to you shows that you aren't interested in dealing with reality.
"Says the guy that denies the reality of this, preventing proper forest management and controlled burns, causes far worse natural ones. Making policy based on feelings is why we're in the mess in the first place"
Yep
Enjoy your false reality.
"Wrong, I have family in NSW, those who were alive say it was hotter in the 50s. The ""abnormally dry"" conditions are perfectly normal. What's different is the past few years controlled burns were banned. Leading to a buildup of burnable material in the bush."
"Watch this and you'll see  the build up: <a href=""https://youtu.be/xNRB8SQbVvE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/xNRB8SQbVvE</a>"

"The ""abnormally dry"" conditions are perfectly normal. "
"Abnormal is normal?  This is the kind of retardation people have to stoop to in order to avoid confronting reality, I'm done with you dude you're absolutely helpless.  I only hope whatever you do in life doesn't fuck the rest of humanity over anymore than you already have."
"Speak for yourself, if you didnt get I was saying what you are calling ""abnormally dry"", is perfectly normal to australians then youre the one with a retardation problem. "
"Are you in australlia, why are you so resistant to listening to the people who live there and know the facts?"
People like you create climate change deniers because in the face of all the evidence you try and use tragedys to push your own agenda.
"Do you have any info on controlled burn practices in the 50’s?
I was assuming we had better technology and practices to do them these days."
Not every fire was started by climate change ... see how easy that is when you dont have to prove your point
Not when they just arrested a fuck ton of people intentionally starting the shit
You're correct in saying that they arrested a lot of people for starting fires. That's undeniable to anyone concerned with facts.
But what is making these fires so unusually intense and difficult to combat? Come on....I know you can figure this out.

"ah yes, because those articles clearly state that <em>every</em> fire was started by arsonists and none of them started naturally or were worsened by climate change."
Oh look at you moving goalposts.
Don’t be mad that the truth doesn’t fit the narrative you want to believe.
Not when they just arrested a fuck ton of people intentionally starting the shit
"so when you said ""the shit"" what you meant was ""some inscrutable percentage of the shit?"""
But <em>I'm</em> moving the goalposts lol
"Mate. All this is is Murdoch headlines. 
The source which they are all getting this from (the NSW website) states that 183 people have been linked to the fires. This means lighting incense, backyard bbq, campfire. Suddenly everyone things 200 people have been charged with arson. Only 24 people have been charged with arson over 2019/2020 season there have been at least 200 fires burning in the last month. 
We have had 8ml of rain in 4 months and every year I have been here there has been rainstorms multiple times a week during this season."
Obviously the climate hasn’t suddenly changed in the last 9 months but this is the biggest drought this area has ever seen and if it gets worse each year more people will die and it’s not enough to just say “fuck it” at least the politicians and coal executives are making some money.
"AP is about as good as it gets. Reuters is pretty good, too."

I take a similar approach. Look at fox and CNN. Compare the story.  Then look at AP. Maybe Christian Monitor and Al Jazeera. Between all that you can get the story.
But who cares enough about a story to go through all that trouble?
Depends on the story. I don’t do it with every story. AP is a good go to in general. But a story that is very controversial or explosive. Then I dig a little more

Libertarian party is generally considered more statist \ more authoritarian than the Democratic and Republican party due to nomination of candidates which support regressive economic policies such as replacing income and estate tax with sales tax.

Then you’d be Democrat’s or republicans.

Does your this account of yours exist to larp libertarian while being a socialist?
All you do is post on this subreddit making me thing this is your alt.
People can't change opinions? You're not very welcoming. The threat of war with Iran changes my support for Trump.
I’m skeptical to believe you but if you have then good on you. Change is a good thing. If this is what it took to stop supporting him then so be it. Congrats on your party change and I hope you can move the libertarian party forward.

That’s like you and aguineapigs saying you aren’t liberal 😂
"Unless you plan on going to the convention in Texas, registering libertarian is a waste. Register democrat or republican so you can vote in your local/state primaries."
Depends on a lot of things. 
"A big part will be how turnout is, especially for parties. In 2016, 65m of 140 some turned out for Democrat. Compare that to 2008 Obama where Obama got 70m of 130. Trump meanwhile nailed 63 million compared 61 for Romney and 60m for McCain. 2008 was a huge turnout which means that third parties ""percentage"" was down."
This is most clear if you see the results for LPUSA: 
"2008 - 530k, 1%"
2012 - 1.2 million. 1%
"Despite 2012 getting double the vote tally in a bad turnout year, his percentage was not even 1% because the other parties dominated the voting still."
Less important. Who runs. As long as they arent a complete shit show (which may be a lot to ask for any party) they'll achieve party level. 
"Donald Trump will probably drag a lot of voters to the polls, he's that divisive a person."
I think who runs will be huge
"Hm. I don't. So long as they are reasonably close to Johnson, they are just not important."
"Who democrats and republicans run is important, not so much libertarians. The LP (and other TP) seems to be a vote to reject the two main parties candiates."
Obviously Dan Behrman or something will end poorly.
I think it's very important. Gary got 3% being basically a buffoon that's cussed on tv because hilary and trump were so hated. If we get Bernie and trump and put up someone even better than gary then it will be even higher than 3%. That's my take.
Gary also was the 2012 candidate. You don't jump 4x the voters with the same candiate unless there is more to it
The more to it was the hated candidates. They are getting more and more polarizing. Turn out plays a role. But that wasnt what made us jump to 3% with the same guy.
"If the people running the party were actually interested in advancing the cause of liberty in America instead of playing pretend politics, they would nominate President Trump and disband the party after the election. "

Fuck them all.
I think it should be mention that this should be said for all substance not just plant based ones but also chemical drugs that literally harm no one. William pickard is serving a non violent drug offender life sentence over a drug that has literally killed 0 people in existence. The main point should be is why are we killing people over thing people put in there own bodies Weather it be a bad or good substance it doesn’t matter most of these people start using the drugs in the first place because they have problems in there own house homes.

And any money left over should be burned while the cop's family watches."
"Make an example out of these fuckers.  Make them realize <em>they</em> are the ones who will foot the bill.  Then they'll start changing.  Once these cops watch one of their pig brothers have to explain to their children that they'll never get to go to college because daddy really really wanted to shoot someone one time, they'll start acting right."
"Or they won't, and they'll all end up dirt-poor and with a legacy of being the man who destroyed their family's future.  Either way I'm fine with it."

I just don't understand. I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror after doing something like this.
I used to say the “gun grabbing” thing was not going to happen because all cops are 2A supporters but the more I see videos liken this they are just power hungry. They will take the guns because they get to keep theirs.

"Yes, noted people who wants cops, uhhhh anarchists"
That means cultural sites and civilian infrastructure will be flagged as targets of military value instead. US military has a long and proud history of striking civilian targets going back decades.
"weird, literally all of the top level comments in this thread are being downvoted... "
never seen that before... it's almost as if...
The Pentagon will do whatever the fuck Trump tells them to do. Which is a strong case to dismantle the Pentagon entirely and cut the power of the government to nothing.
Will they? Unlawful orders and such... But you're probably right.
Evidence to this of which is..?
Them doing it in the past after Trump removed the officers that disagreed with him and left their position vacant with a junior person acting in their place. Trump has done this all across the executive branch.
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
What classifies a place as a cultural site? Can we just put crosses on top of all our missile bases and make it a war crime if someone attacks them?
"""laws of war"" is one of the more insane human inventions. If you can agree to terms to do battle why not just settle it over a nice game of chess?"

No because they have a clear military value. 
"""laws of war"" is one of the more insane human inventions. If you can agree to terms to do battle why not just settle it over a nice game of chess?"
"If you wanted to you could, but the laws of war are some of the best things humans have devised, it helps protect non-combatants and provides a moral guideline for combatants of the world to follow.  Its not perfect by any means but it is better than having nothing at all."
yes we should agree to kill each other in the most pleasant way possible.
"Yes we shouldn't blow up historic sites that have no military value whatsoever, I agree"
"Yea but that guy working in the power plant, fuck him right?"
Have you gone from arguing laws of war are asinine to arguing we shouldn't target anything? 
"I feel like no matter what I say you'll just spew some bullshit for the sake of argument.  Power Plants can be valid military targets, what that has to do with cultural sites I don't know and I don't think you do either."
"I'm saying that if we can agree to be nice and not attack churches, we can agree to not kill each other at all. Its either war or it isn't."

Iran gunna get an ass whoopin if they escalate this any further
The same people said the same things about Iraq and Afghanistan...
"In fairness, they weren't entirely wrong.  Both Saddam's army and the Taliban's conventional forces couldn't withstand the military might of the United States and its allies."
"But what people like <a href=""/u/Breadstick_Dildo"" rel=""nofollow"">u/Breadstick_Dildo</a> fail to understand is that an ""ass whoopin"" alone means little here."
"Sure, we'd almost certainly defeat the Iranian military sooner or later.  Then what?  "
"If the point of this conflict is to stop Iran from backing terrorist groups in the region, we'd have to install a new government.  That means occupation, nation-building, and probably getting bogged down in counter-insurgency operations.  It would take years, if not decades.  And all that time, more Americans are dying and more taxpayer money is getting spent on the Middle Eastern quagmire."
"If we didn't bother with an occupation, it would be even worse.  Either their current government retains power--allowing them to rebuild their military and continue propping up terrorists--or the country collapses into the kind of chaos we see in Libya post-Gaddafi.  Chaos like that often gives birth to an even worse state of affairs."
"TL;DR ""ass whoopin""s can't achieve our political goals in conflicts like this.  You'd think we'd have learned our lesson from Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan, but I guess that's too much to expect out of this Administration."
But think about all those juicy defense contracts.
Ok boomer.
Conscription is Slavery
"Probably against the general principle of people being forced into military service. I will say though, in my time in the military, I've come across a lot of people who hold to more libertarian views, even my own views shifted into the realm of libertarianism. "
"If you're thinking that they are going to actually draft people in the US to fight in Iran, they won't."
"Thats what gives me eye rolls right now. All these memes, posts, comments, articles about a draft for a potential war with Iran. First of all, I still think its a slim chance we declare a war on Iran, and second, even if we do, there is a zero chance we’ll need a draft."
Agreed.
zero chance we’ll need a draft
I doubt that's true.
Not trying to be alarmist- I think the whole war part is a low probability in the first place. But if we do- the American people dont exactly support it so volunteer numbers won't be any higher (lower likely) than they are now. And we would need a larger military than we have now. So how do you make up the difference? 
Of course that all goes to the politics of what do the politicians really care about? If they don't actually care about winning in a reasonable amount of time- sure just send the army we have now and don't relieve them of any of the other things they are doing everywhere else. It won't be enough and we get bogged down in another conflict with no end in sight. That's just assuming Russia doesn't step in.
Why would we need a larger military than we have now?
"I’m definitely not afraid of being conscripted at this point of time, but as an 18 year old male, I think about these kind of things."
"Also, thank you for you service ."
"You ain't gotta worry about it, enough of us have our own reasons for joining, and the benefits keep enough of us around that we won't ever dip down to Pre-Veitnam numbers again."

"I’m in right now, and all my friends are legit “government can do no wrong” and “we have those hundred something bases over there to protect them ect crap. Results in many arguments at the bar every Sunday."
A draft is essentially slavery. Fuck that.
We keep our 2nd amendment rights to protect our family and friends.  Most everything else is a waste.
First and foremost we have done just fine militarily with a volunteer army.  I'm not in favor of any draft.  But if there ever were to be a real need for a draft (basically talking an actual WWII scale event) I would rather see this kind of system because it could at least be somewhat fair if you controlled for some of the corruption / avoidance.
"Continuing the draft after the end of WWII was an abomination, and made it all too easy to have our misadventure in Vietnam. Good riddance."
"I’m sad when I see the statistics of causalities in such a pointless war. The soldiers weren’t fighting for America, they were fighting for D.C."
"What do you think it is, based on your understanding of libertarianism?"
"It’s very blurry for me. On one hand, I can see a problem with the federal government conscripting young men to risk their lives in the military, because of a war started by politicians in Washington. On the other hand, especially if this war was more on the defensive side, I think Americans naturally should stand up and defend the country."
"On the other hand, especially if this war was more on the defensive side, I think Americans naturally should stand up and defend the country."
"The draft doesn't exist to defend the country. It exists to defend the regime. If the regime is threatened and no one wants to fight for it, perhaps the invaders offer a better option."
"Your initial impulse is generally considered the correct one. I don’t want to engage in a ‘No True Scotsman’ but I’d be skeptical of anyone who claims to be both a libertarian AND in favor of a draft. If the government forces you to do it, you aren’t free."
Touché.
"Abolish both the Selective Service and the draft, the draft is slavery and Selective Service leads to it"
"I wouldn’t even support restarting the draft if there were a literal Red Dawn-like invasion of America. Even then, I would support Americans’ right to not fight if they so choose"
"You're 18?  Awesome!  Pick your form of slavery, just in case we decide to force the issue."
"Not a fan. But I believe in the event of a WWII level conflict, or any conflict on home soil, it may be necessary to prevent the loss of many more lives."
If Canada were to invade the US and we were short on troops (hypothetically) then yes I’d see a draft as the best of many bad options
Should women be equally exposed to a draft? Are there any feminists or gender identification activists here that would like to chime in?
"If we continue with the selective services, I think all non-disabled U.S. citizens should qualify for the draft."
I can’t think of a strong argument in disagreement of that. You seem to be a wise 18 year old.
I definitely have a lot to learn.
The definition of <em>disability</em> could be a loop hole some might play around with.
"I think low-functioning mental disabilities should be exempt, but I’m not sure what degree of physical disability one should have to be exempt."
"There is no libertarian justification for the draft, and people should be free to leave the military at any time for any reason - no one should be forced to fight a war in a foreign country that is no threat to them."
I'm not a libertarian but honestly I feel like they should bring the draft back for any major conflict.
See how willing people are to support war when their sons will be sent to it
This is a pragmatic point and not a libertarian one- I'm ignoring the morality of a draft and putting that part aside for a moment.
Ending the draft created a major problem.  It completely detached the American public from the issues of war. This freed up the politicians to engage in conflicts without much regard for public support. Politicians want to send troops to war? Not a major issue that will affect the average voter or member of the public and those that go are all volunteers so it doesn't take a high bar to justify it enough for the unaffected public to accept those deaths.
"Prior to that the public had a very keen interest in war and paying attention to it. Even if it didn't affect the individual (female, too old etc) pretty much everyone knows someone who could be very directly affected. Didn't have to be a ""draft"" exactly- for half our national history it was mandatory ever male has to own their own firearm that meets military specs and show up for militia training periodically. Part of the collapse of that system was state politicians creating/allowing more and more exemptions until we ran into trouble during the war with Mexico due to lack of adequate trained troops. But getting people out of service was popular."
No truer words have been spoken.  Try reading the news...or finding any objectively generated news....at best it’s a balancing act of opinions they play...nothing objective...and always the the emotional appeal.
Balancing opinions doesn’t mean either or both are right...truth is truth...I wish people would stop believing that everyone has their own “truth”.
"It doesn’t help either that all the media people consume is owned by a handful of connected people that share similar interests. Breaking down massive media establishments is healthiest for the consumer, as they can get a varied media diet and see new perspectives where it is welcome, and objective truth when it is needed."

"""Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal supporter; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question incapacity to act on any. Frantic violence became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting a justifiable means of self-defense. The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In short, to forestall an intending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was lacking was equally commended, until even blood became a weaker tie than party, from the superior readiness of those united by the latter to dare everything without reserve; for such associations sought not the blessings derivable from established institutions but were formed by ambition to overthrow them; and the confidence of their members in each other rested less on any religious sanction than upon complicity in crime."""

When has the average human ever mostly been exposed to objective truth? People with power and agendas have always distributed propaganda or marketing to benefit themselves and their family/tribe/group. That's a far more profitable use of time and money than distributing objective truth.
"But it is true that I can't think of a single media source that I trust to just give me objective truth. It's really unfortunate. People need to realize the news passes through a filter where it is made to fit certain narratives. There's a reason you hear about how horrible climate change will be in 12 years (really 50+ years), but rarely hear about the millions of people dying this year of preventable causes."
It’s better economy to make people angry rather than sad. Climate change is a relevant topic that people will always argue over. Nobody’s ever going to say “millions dying of preventable disease isn’t <em>that</em> bad”. It’s about controversy.
Objective truth was never a real thing. Times past were not full of people who all agreed that one thing was always true and another always false. Such a situation would be a cripplingly and oppressively conformist dystopia like in Equilibrium or Equals.
"Objective truth is real at one point in time. Like, the sky is blue. Right now it is, but that could change."
"While I do think this is a bigger issue than impeachment or Iran; unless I'm missing something, this looks like a really poor solution to a problem.  Maybe it would be better to break up the monopolistic practices of some of these drug companies than turning over yet more power to the government."
The government
Fair enough
True story
"Cops, corrupt government, taxes"
The literal lack of liberty.
"Any particular events, or just the problems in general?"
Everything. 
"Woke up one day realizing im paying hundreds a year for the government to track me in my vehicle, track my life whether or not I fish or hunt and i pay them to do it. Long list of other things. Cops getting away with murder, rape, dui, etc"
"Government corruption convicting innocent people, violating peoples rights to a fair trail and due process.."
Hundreds a year?  How do you get away with a tax bill in the hundreds?
My reference of hundreds was specifically in regards to vehicle registration and how the entire system is used to track you.
"My bad, I thought you were talking about your tax burden."

Growing up in a Republican town and seeing the hypocrisy.
Was there a certain point where the hypocrisy just fell apart?
Where they talk about individual freedom and deficit spending.  It's been 16 years and its gotten worse.
"Once I started liking guns, I started to see how corrupt and wrong the government was about them. That lead me to start questioning everything and happened across libertarianism in the process."
"Mine is similar. I was first and foremost pro gun, and didn’t like that all the pro gun candidates were anti-weed/gay marriage/abortion. Specifically with gay marriage (or marriage in general) I thought the government should stay out of that. "
Took a few years before I found out wtf a libertarian was.
That's about how it went for me. I was for all that shit as well. I felt so out of place until I find libertarianism.
Ron Paul
"I'm a kinda young, why do so many people find Ron Paul inspiring?"
"Idk where to start. He basically is everything you want in a Libertarian Politican. They called him Dr No because he voted no on everything. He's a brilliant, kind man, he's a real treasure. "
"Some people refer to him as a philosopher, and I don't disagree. He's done soo much to spread the message of peace and sound Economic principles. Check out the Ron Paul Liberty Report, it's great. "
"Just look up debates from 2008 &amp; 2012, he clearly outclassed everyone on stage"
Read his book End The Fed asap
"He was the first major candidate of most young people's lifetimes to get on stage and criticize foreign wars and drug laws and the defense budget. And Ron Paul knows how to lie by omission to ingratiate himself to an audience, and so he uses populist rhetoric to appeal to people who oppose the concept of victimless crime and our unprovoked wars of aggression, while keeping his views on the EPA and public education to himself because he knows they're unpopular, and so lots of people who never read the fine print thought Ron Paul was on their side because they only knew where he stood on those two issues."
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/jlTYAGxg_yg"" rel=""nofollow"">Stop Lying </a>"
"Mises is more famous now than ever, thanks to Ron Paul"
"Populist rhetoric like End the Fed. Austrian Economics, Legalize Heroin?"
"Who's lying? He says it right in your little video. He wants to abolish the EPA and leave environmental protection to the marketplace, and as is typical he has couched this view in a bunch of vague bullshit rhetoric about how he's actually going to be more forceful in protecting the environment using the means he doesn't specify according to rules he hasn't explained. Classic libertarian rhetoric. Say as little as necessary and leave yourself as much wiggle room as possible because you know you'll never be tested, and so you get to say whatever you want. The progressive fringe plays the same disingenuous game."
"You are lying by omission. He's not ok with pollution, that's what you are trying to claim."
When I realized that Republicans and Democrats were both taxing us to death to spend the money on whatever the lobbyists consider their best interest.
"With that idea in mind, what do you think about the Democratic canidates promising to avoid taking lobbyist or corporate money? Obviously, much of their policy isn't libertarian, but do you see it as a hopeful sign or as just a pack of lies?"
"I don't believe it for a second. First off, I've gotten down voted to oblivion in other sites for arguing, but I don't think that one party is inherently good or bad. So I don't think Democrats are ""better"" than the Republicans."
"Since Obama, it costs roughly a billion dollars just to become president. They aren't generating that money by enthusiasts ""chipping in"" a few dollars. That is major corporate interests. It doesn't really matter which party that money is going to, those investors are pulling the strings."
Seeing the need for a less powerful government and reading what the founding fathers wrote made me want to be a libertarian.  Reading the extremist opinions of a lot of the people here made me into an independent with libertarian views.
The desire to be able to conduct my own life and affairs as I see fit.
"The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools to Restrict, Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act. Aka the Patriot Act."
"I'm not a libertarian, (I have far to favorable a view of government) but I've always thought that the Patriot act was absolute Insanity."
"As I became more informed of the effects of a centralized government and how historically those systems have failed, I became more libertarian. "
"I also worked hard through college, and became an avid gym goer around the same time. Both of those led me to be placing merit as the top qualifier for success and wealth."
Born that way I guess. Government just seems naturally evil to me
"When I was eight I argued with my very Catholic mother on why we don’t talk to our lesbian aunt anymore. Her reasoning was stupid, my aunt was a wonderful whose closeted life hurt herself beyond anything. "
I then realized I felt towards the government what I felt towards my mother when I had that argument. I felt even worse towards the government when my mother changed her views on LGBT people but the government has become even more restrictive since the 80s
War.
"Food freedom. I wanted to be able to buy unpasteurized milk from a local farmer but it was illegal. That coincided with Ron Paul's campaign, and he was the only candidate to talk about the issue. I started reading more about his beliefs, got into Austrian economics from there, read Joel Salatin's <em>Everything I Want To Do Is Illegal</em>, studied for a minute with FEE, got into Mises... But everything started with illegal milk."
"Most people are and just dont know it. Most people want the Government to waste less tax money, most people wish to live their lives without being made to feel like a criminal for victimless acts like smoking a plant or marrying anyone you want. Most people dont want a huge Government lording over everything in our country as well as the entire world. "
"We would all be taxed much less for a smaller, less wasteful Government that doesn't impede on personal freedoms or military occupy the entire planet."
"That's a powerful sentiment, thanks for sharing."
I became a libertarian when my brother told me gary johnson was running in 2020. So I looked into him and the party. I drank the koolaid and taxation is theft

"Dealing with the DMV to get an ID, reading about dumbass laws and regulations, and listening to the current crop of idiots in the Democratic and Republican parties"
"The best way to say it is when you finally open your eyes and see that there really is no difference in democrats and republicans when it comes to running the government. It will only get bigger and the “entitlements” never stop.

"I was young and naive, then I realized how much shittier a place the world would be if we left it to Russia and China."
Are you implying a more interventionist policy for world affairs or working through other means?
No one-size-fits-all.  Just take action when we need to take action.
"Funny, I didn't think there were many libertarians that followed that type of philosophy, since it can lead to larger government, though I do think it's a smart answer."
"Well yeah, I wouldn’t call myself libertarian  nowadays.  I consider myself more of a moderate, but the changing political climate puts me to the right by today’s standards."

I know Trump supporters aren't going to notice a tax on wine Champaign and cheese but this is another tax that the rest of us will end up paying.
[deleted]
I love your comment is right above someone saying no normal American would consume such products.
I think it’s really trashy of you to take a dig at people for not being as well off as you are.
"stfu, what normal American is actually consuming french wine and champagne, and cheese that is shipped from France.  like literally none of us, except the rich."
TIL I'm rich.
Bro I just picked up a bottle of Bordouex wine for $15
"When I lived in Taiwan all the local supermarkets always stocked french wine and cheese. In fucking Taiwan. All rich Taiwanese people don't even live in Taiwan. Yet they still have French wine and cheese. Moron. Wine and cheese isn't even a thing in Asia. Your head is so far up your uneducated, uncultured ass that you defended the most idiotic, unproductive and authoritarian economic policy imaginable: a tax on the best fucking wine and cheese to ever grace mankind."
"or ya know just buy local, but you guys do you."
"You can’t get got Brie, Camembert or Stilton in the US. Some people prefer French wines over California/WA/OR wines."
"sorry we prefer to pasteurize our dairy, so no brie for me. and sorry we dont have a state called champagne, so no American made champagne.  These are all excuses, from people who are worried about having to pay taxes on their luxury goods."
Trump supporters pushing for more taxes? I’m shocked!
French wines and champagne that are very drinkable can be under $15 a bottle. California vintners  it wines from France and ferment and bottle here (Mark West Pinot is French grapes) 
French cheeses that are very good to eat can be under $15 a pound
"I’m bought this wine the other night for $12. Very drinkable.<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/sgY3ApF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/sgY3ApF.jpg</a>"
"So sorry, you’re wrong. Middle class/middle income wine drinkers will get hit by this."
"so riddle me this batman, why not an local alternative, why is this luxury good, that is only taxed from importation, is so popular for ""middle class"" Americans?  Most people from my part of the country probably cant tell you the last time they drank ""french"" wine."
I actually prefer California wines over French so there is definitely alternative for a  guy like me. But there is no alternative to Brie  or Stilton. 
You’d actually be surprised how many wines they come from California wineries are French great. Marleau and Pinot  were extremely Popular and there was a shortage of grapes in the US. To some wineries bought grapes from France had them shipped over and then fermented them and bottled them here. You can see it on a bottle of California wine it’ll say “Vin de pays”. I don’t know the exact translation but from what I understand it means Made from French grapes
My dad sells booze to restaurants and clubs and stuff and he said these tariffs will put him out of business. I seriously regret voting for trump
Is this a sarcastic comment? I can't even tell.
No sarcasm dude. I’m serious. My dads livelihood is under threat from these retarded tariffs
"Okay, so why did you vote for the guy who explicitly vowed during the campaign to do exactly this? Did you just not think about the consequences of doing so?"
I did not. Believe me I realize my mistakes
All good man. I have done similar things in the past myself
"Good luck to you and your pop, I hope he can ride this out"
Ya I’m rooting for him. I’m encouraging him to do tax free sales to make a little extra money but he’s turning down that suggestion
"Good on you. It’s great to see people realize their mistakes and are willing to change their mind. I’ve always said I don’t have an issue with anybody that voted for Trump it’s just people who are still supporting him now, after all the crazy things he’s done, that I have an issue with. I sincerely hope things work out for your dad. It’s sad to see hard-working people get hit with something like this. Have a great week"
But Trump said he was going to do this in his campaign. Did you not know how tariffs work?
I didn’t realize at the time
So what did you vote for?
"Dude plz what s up with the ""told you so !""  "" see you deserved it "" ... come on man . Never take joy in another person s misfortune . Lay a end , give a word of encouragement or move along ."
Did i call out that Trump was a disaster and would end up hurting his own electorate ? Yes . Will i go around boasting in the face of those people when they are hurting ? No ... Why because of a simple thing called empathy . Show some and you ll see you ll feel better and others will feel better too.
I think you responded to the wrong comment
Make a better choice next time
Believe me I will
"I mean... unless they can convince the rest of the EU, or most of it I guess, there's really not much they can do. Good luck convincing most countries who export 0 wine, cheese and whatever else to go along with whatever France wants to do."
Why are we taxing them?
Dutch cheese is better.
It certainly can be Gouda!
This is a directed attack against wine caves everywhere!

"So there is one main reason why we have higher costs on heathcare than other places. Our big pharma has a monopoly. And our regulations have skyrocketed admin costs to being more than double the percentage of total costs than other 1st world nations. This is due to regulations hurting the billing side of heathcare. And protecting the big pharma side. Now when you take this stance the left will automatically hate you. And the furthest of the lefties love Bernie right. Well Bernie agrees with half of this. Any libertarian will support his <a href=""https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/affordable-and-safe-prescription-drug-importation-act-introduced-to-help-lower-skyrocketing-cost-of-medicine"" rel=""nofollow"">Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act</a> this is a free market idea that would kill the big pharma monopoly. The other solution is deregulation."
Edit: notice. This is ignoring the universal healthcare argument. These things need to be done regardless of universal (socializing) healthcare. Because it will still be more expensive if you dont kill the source of the problem.
"Thanks for the reply, I appreciate your help."
"This is something that I, a strong opponent of socialized healthcare, have been promoting for years.  It really should be a bipartisan effort.  (And in fact, <a href=""https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/white-house-backs-drug-importation-prices-azar-sharpless/559940/"" rel=""nofollow"">Trump sent up some trial balloons on this about 6 months ago</a>, if anyone was paying attention.)  I'll support any politician who promotes such a bill as long as it isn't riddled with additional bad ideas."
Part of the reason drugs are so cheap in other countries is that their governments negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers.  This sounds like a great idea until you realize that it is effectively a price cap that kills innovation.  The US is essentially footing the bill for all global pharmaceutical innovation because our consumers actually sometimes pay something akin to a market price for drugs while most of the other developed countries do not.  
"Drug companies develop their cutting edge drugs for the US, where they can sell for, say, $10 a pill.  If they can't sell to the US for $10 a pill, they just aren't going to bother developing the drug.  However, unlike with most products and services, if France or Canada says they will only pay $2 per pill, drug companies will still sell to them.  Why?  Because why not?  The US market is effectively protected by drug reimportation laws.  Meanwhile the pharmaceutical industry is notoriously characterized  by extremely high fixed costs and extremely low variable costs.  In truth, the cost of manufacturing that pill may be pennies, so they will still earn a gross profit selling to Canada or France.  They would never be profitable without the US, but as long as selling to the socialized markets doesn't hurt the US market, they will sell to everyone."
"Allowing drug reimportation (in part) solves the issue.  The socialized countries would lose their bargaining power, their prices would go up, and US prices would likely fall in the long term."
People who think perfect competition always exists incoming.
"The reasons against have been pretty well covered so far, but lets talk about solutions.  "
"One of the reasons that healthcare is so expensive is the fact that insurance is used to pay for everything including check ups.  So, a doctor or a medical group can charge insurance companies much more than an individual and since just about everyone carries insurance they go with the insurance pricing.  This naturally drives up the price of a doctor visit."
"Now, as a solution to this we need to get away from using insurance for regular doctor visits.  This will encourage doctors to bring down their prices for normal checkups and other such activity.  There are medical groups out there where you can pay a monthly rate, and have as many doctor visits as you need for general practitioners.  These are usually better than insurance rates and you don't have a deductible you have to meet either."
"<a href=""https://www.partnermd.com/membership-benefits/insurance-pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.partnermd.com/membership-benefits/insurance-pricing/</a>"
"Medical insurance should really just cover catastrophic care such as cancer, heart disease etc.  "
"Its the same with the Pharma companies.  They can charge the rates for the drugs they sell because insurance companies will pay it because in a lot of cases they are obligated to do so.  If the pharma companies had to compete in a true market for drugs, we'd likely see a lot better rates on prescription drugs."
"You realize that this subreddit is a shitty source for this type of issue, right? You should never cite social media and any data a,collected is faster obtained by Bing."
I’m not using this as a source. I just want to hear people’s opinions on the topic.
The following is an old comment of mine regarding a solution to healthcare in the US. It solves most of the causes of our high prices in ways that a universal system wont.
"I think there is a solution that opens the markets, reduces costs, but does not let the poor go without access to care. There are a few categories of things that need to be addressed."
The first thing is to make sure those needing assistance are not cut off from care while allowing the market to grow to cover them over time. These are the steps that need to be taken for this.
The second thing is to encourage the growth of competition and supply of care. These things must be done to accomplish this.
The third is to change the way that insurance is used. It should never have become a payment plan for all healthcare and should become insurance again. This can happen through some changes.
"If these things are done, we should see prices reduce substantially for healthcare by eliminating the expensive administration costs associated with most care, increasing competitive pricing, decreasing other expenses associated with insurance and taxes. We'll see an increase in healthcare providers and insurers that are all competing for business by improving quality and decreasing costs. Prices for medications will also become much cheaper in a competitive market as more suppliers enter the market."
You are forcing people to pay for something they don't get.  You pay for the healthcare you use and I'll pay for the healthcare I use.  If there are no limits to the care then anyone will go for any reason and overload the system.  When it is a fee based service you need to think about how you are using it.
"Universalized Catastrophic Insurance.  Most people don't stay up at night worrying about paying for their check-up in a few weeks.  They are terrified that they will get cancer or a heart attack, etc.  But so few people get those things that it would be relatively cheap to cover them.  It's all the regular healthcare that is expensive."
"It might just be me but I still don’t know how we would pay for universal healthcare year after year after year. Providing free health care for 330million people is way more complex than any candidate let’s on. Not only that, but I’ll be damned if the government is running the healthcare system. "
"I’m not saying drug prices, insurance premiums and hospital bills aren’t insane. I’m a type 1 diabetic reaping the benefits of Obamacare (staying on parents insurance till 26 and not being able to get dropped cause of preexisting condition).... The answer is not FREE. I don’t know what the answer and this topic is way above my pay grade. "
But it is absolutely sickening that there is not something that can be brought up in a bipartisan manner to tackle that issue. 
If drug prices weren’t bonkers and unexpected hospital bills weren’t 10s of thousands of dollars would we really be have a universal healthcare debate? 
The companies that Americans made into power houses are the very companies that are turning their back on us.
It might just be me but I still don’t know how we would pay for universal healthcare year after year after year.
The same way poorer natioms with universal healthcare managed... This isnt a mystery..
Uh? Do you mind explaining?
"Copy Europe. Cap drug company profits by collective bargaining of the nation weight against the company. Remember, corperations only exist because the nation lets them, the nation can ask for its pound of flesh in return for the benefits it give. Same goes for hospitals costs. Say you pay this much for a procedure and the hospital can do the bean counting on which part of the staff gets money.  Collectively pool people into groups. Universal healthcare is the word"
There around 50 examples in Europe. Pick one. Work with it.
So no response? Just copy whatever Europe is doing? If it was so easy you’d think maybe you could explain it but clearly not
Edit: classic liberal downvoting but no way to justify their reasoning. CLASSIC
Such a coward and clearly left wing brainwashed
"Yeah 50 examples of 50 different systems in place, not a conglomerate of 750million people in the same plan throughout all of Europe.... So yes I do know what your talking about and that brought my to my key statement of the United States has 330million people. It is far more complicated than any candidate let’s on"
There is no such thing as free healthcare. There is paying on the front end with universal healthcare and there is paying as you use it like our system is supposed to be. 
"Countries that have universal healthcare not only pay roughly 30% income tax, but also have a 20-25% sales tax. Healthier people pay less than unhealthy people on our system which encourages healthy behavior where UK is now legislating high calorie foods. You also have cases like Charlie Gard where the state decided that charlie needed to die despite the parent's wishes and the crowd funded money to life flight Charlie to a hospital in California to try and save Charlie."
"To fix it, we need to get rid of obamacare and reform patent laws on drugs to allow for more competition in the market. To lower insurance costs, allow for a federal broker's license instead of a state that way every insurance company is in your market."
Countries that have universal healthcare not only pay roughly 30% income tax
Americans pay more in taxes towards healthcare than anywhere in the world.

"Yeah watch your fucking mouth, there could be kids here dumbass."
"Just wondering if you think <a href=""/u/Surpentstone"">u/Surpentstone</a>'s language violates your NAP?"
I think its free speech..
Then they shall shoot on public land!
"It's the way I grew up.  If you wanted to go target shooting in PA, you went to one of the many publicly owned, FREE gun ranges.  And it's still that way today.  "
"I've gone to one indoor range down here in VA and I refuse to go back.  It's not a comfortable environment for me to be shooting a gun indoors next to 10 other dudes, the closest being 3 feet away from me on either side."
"I like my indoor LGC, but shooting outside is so much better, especially since I can have a beer 😊"
"Exactly, but of course it's illegal to drink beers at the range; but I get your drift.  When we go outside, it's me, my brother, my dad, girlfriend, etc.  We can talk in between, there's no rushing, plenty of room and nowhere near as loud.  It's just a more natural setting to have fun, relax and shoot off some rounds (with banter and bullshitting in between)."
And no stupid rules about rapid firing
"There are rules about rapid firing, but unless there's a Game Commissioner, there's no one there to enforce the rule.  My brother, when he's not teaching, is a part time Game Commissioner, says that sometimes they will stake out in the woods next to ranges and watch to see if people are not following rules, and if they do catch you rapid firing, they will ticket you."
Exactly how many bullets per sec is considered “rapid firing”? Never heard or such a thing. Isn’t that the point of self defense training? To put as many caps in your attacker as quickly as possible?
"It is not allowed at any firing ranges I've ever been to, indoors or outdoors.  "
"Why?  Go to an indoor range and take a look around.  Why are there bullet holes where there shouldn't be any? It's because dummies pretend they are gangstas and can't realign their sights fast enough (due to recoil) before firing off the next shot, hence bullets going nowhere near the intended target."
"It's a safety issue.  If you can't follow the rules, probably shouldn't own a gun."
The question was how fast is rapid firing? 
A .22 and a .50 are going to take much different times to resight.
"I don't make the rules, so I'm not exactly sure how many shots fired within a 3-5 second window would qualify as 'rapid fire'; however, common sense should be able to allow you to decipher between controlled shooting and acting like a jackass at a firing range."
"I have rapid fired a .22 before at an outdoor range when I was the only person on site, but I would never do it when someone else was present.  Just our of respect for following the rules and safety, of course."
"From what I've observed, it seems that 2 shots per sight picture is a double tap, and more that 2 shots per sight picture is considered rapid fire. With an AR-15 I was able to do a mag dump (30 rounds) in about 10 seconds without violating range rules. All of my shots had thier own sight picture and all were on target (3"" spread at 21 feet). The less recoil, the faster you can reset and get your next shot lined up so rapid fire is a threshold that will be caliber and weapon specific as well as subjective to the user's proficiency. I think as long as you follow the one shot (or 2 where double taps are permitted) per sight picture (and you can articulate and demonstrate this if approached) you should be fine."
"Same reason I prefer to dive on road trips than fly if I can help it.  Well, except for the drinking beer part."
"Yeah, well trying driving to Hawaii."

We have many constitutional issues lately. It's almost as if there's an agenda and they don't care about constitutionality.
"How likely is that to pass? It's disturbing, but if it's like trying to make a snowball out of sand then it doesnt matter too much."
more than 50 employees in an indoor shooting range? Even if it passes I don't know wtf the point is except to generate these kinds of headlines. What indoor range has over 50 employees?

"that makes sense, a 'fuck you in particular' type of bill. Dumb and petty."
"Given the makeup of their new congress, I would say pretty damn likely."
"It’s not likely at all, it’s a bill sponsored by a brand new rep who also was one of the like 3 behind the other bill that’s 100% not going anywhere."
This is just GOP fearmongering.
fearmongering
"It's really fearmongering by the radical rep who submitted the bill. He/she is just trying to incite fear and it give the rep the ability to tell his/her constituents that they were a ""voice of reason on gun control"". It's complete bullshit."
Are the Democrats trying to lose on purpose? I really don't understand. The police will not enforce this and without the police the legislators are clawless.
Police would absolutely enforce this. 
"“Hey there, officer Fudd. If you don’t want to execute this judicial warrant, that’s fine, but you’re fired for cause. I hope you didn’t need that pension or access to easy OT."
"Officer Dinglenuts, step into my office. Congratulations, you’re promoted. I’ve got a warrant for you to execute.”"
"Later, at the barbecue, Officer Dinglenuts tells his friends, “Look, it was a signed warrant. I don’t write the law, I just implement it. The rest is for the weiners on Capitol Hill.”"
"Also their favorite line: ""Let the judge sort it out"" when they arrest you."
"You’re going to have those, sure. But the reason they are threatening to bring the Guard in is because local LE is saying they will not comply. I know plenty (including myself) that would give up my job for a principle as vital as 2A rights."
"There is a difference depending on what happens... if it's merely a law to be enforced, Congress/Council can choose not to spend money to enforce it and police have Discretion as well."
But if it's a court order (like a warrant or that latin phrase for a court order to force a go'vt employee to do their job) then they have two choices: Quit or be held in contempt and their less scrupulous 'brothers in blue' put them in jail until they agree to enforce the court order and/or future orders.
"If that were the case, I’d say quitting would be an easy choice."
Lisa needs braces.

"If I were law enforcement, I would fear for my life enforcing these warrants."
"Even if we assume that they are purely self-interested, remember that sheriffs are elected, So they have incentive to keep their electorate happy."
This whole situation is just begging for bloodshed and the cops are going to be out numbered 10000 to 1.
I think overestimate how many people give a shit about this
As a liberal are used to think that. My rebuttal to “they’re going to take all the  guns” used to be that the police are big Second Amendment supporters. It seems the police are big “do whatever the fuck I tell you” supporters.

Can you relate your experiences to the topic of this sub (libertarianism) in any way at all?
Otherwise it's off-topic and breaks the rules
I am born here but Persian and look it  . Been dealing with it my whole life here and there just ignore it and move on . 
The funniest story was 10 ish years ago I went to Israel with birth right . We where heading home 40-50 kids and tour guides walking into Israel airport really early all together  . Plain clothes Israel guards swarmed around only me and demanded my ID and no one else’s asking me some retarded questions .
Last time I got pulled over the cops opening line was “ is this your car “ . I didn’t realize until I left with no ticket that he thought the car was stolen because I dress homeless and drive a nice car .
A senior senile  neighbor called the cops on me because I walked across his neighbors lawn( not his )  for a second . “ you know how I know you aren’t in the military because our men are killing your people overseas and they would kill you too”
"I am literally only complimented for my blue eyes. I was made fun of for EVERYTHING else. One time, back in middle school, this black kid said I looked like Hitler because of my slicked back, black hair hair. I'm made fun of consistently for how pale I am, and I was victim to the ""skinny white boi = school shooter hehe funny"" bullshit. I got expelled from my school because I made a passing comment about a new Vector model I thought looked cool. Maybe realize that everyone has their advantages and disadvantages in the society they grow up in, I had my blue eyes, but oh no! My birth parents were underage heroine addicts! That doesnt invalidate your experience, and what happened to you was wrong, but dont try and tear down the only fucking compliment I ever get just because you've experienced suffering. I was born to heroine addicts, adopted by a destroyed family, met my birth father in prison to hear that my mother never wanted to see me, and diagnosed with bi-polar depression from both genetics, and consistent harrassment that affected me from childhood. We all suffer, but that doesnt mean I've suffered more, or that you've suffered less, but that also doesnt mean we tear others down."
"Blue eyes are pretty, even though they're a genetic disadvantage they've pushed through, I happen to quite like middle-eastern men as a bisexual dude, anyways, that was a rant about tearing others down, and I dunno how to end comments."
Edit: some spelling errors and added some detail about my hair.
Based on your description there's a pretty good chance you're just weird looking.  We all have our crosses to bear I suppose.
"""Let's start with the very concept of democracy to begin with: other people voting how much of my property to plunder."""
This one cracked me up
That is honestly what made me want to post it.
"At publishing time, Rand had also reminded the nation that all taxation is theft."
Checks out
"Double-checked it with a libertarian. He said ""Yeah that's right."" So I guess we can believe Rand"
"Why are you posting authoritarian propaganda on <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/libertarian</a>?"
"In a pure republic, there are no representatives, and the government is operated by residents which assemble in a town square. In a democratic republic, residents elect representatives to attend assemblies for them, so that the operation of a public government is extended across a larger land area. Elections are thus primarily a communication technology for managing a republic across a larger land area, and residents right to participate in elections is derived from their right to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."
"At publishing time, Rand had also reminded the nation that all taxation is theft"
"This sounds like anarcho-capitalism, not libertarianism. Anarcho-capitalists are not libertarians. It's ethical for a public government to collect mandatory direct fees on patents and private claims to exclusive use of land and ideas as compensation to other residents for the loss of economic opportunity resulting from the removal of these assets from the public domain."
Babylon.

I just want to bend over for Trump and let him have me.
That's exactly what I'm saying we should do. Just give in to the most popular authoritarian of the time. Its libertarian way.
Completely agree. I want to be fucked by <em>this</em> authoritarian. Why don't people see the way??
Dude. Just pick an authoritarian and make up some bullshit on why they are the lesser authoritarian and then have a ethics boner that you are doing the right thing.
Trump doesn't cage white immigrants
"See, I <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> HIM!"
Moral boner engaged
"Obviously. Honestly if you're not voting for the authoritarian this time around, there's no way you're a <strong>real</strong> libertarian."
That's what I'm trying to say
"I think you forgot the ""/s"""
OP actually thinks voting democrat is worse than voting for trump
Is the democrat going to take more of my rights away then trump? If yes. Vote democrat. If no vote trump.
How about you answer your own question.
So.... you admit both will take rights away and it's about preserving the rights you have left for the longest amount of time possible? So basically vote for slower erosion?
I didn’t see an answer. Which do you think will take more of your rights?
I dont vote for the lesser of my rights being taken away
"It's cool that you won't vote for the lesser evil, because that means neither evil will be implemented."
You've thwarted their plans with this galaxy brain move.
"Damn, still dancing. Which party will take away more, bud? You were quick to make this thread to mock the other guy but you’re just as slippery."
I'm voting LP. I made this thread to make fun of the people asking your exact question
Not what I asked. Read it again
Yes your asking who will be less authoritarian of the authoritarians.
"How does banning the private insurance industry, banning private ownership of semi-automatic firearms, and raising taxes equate more rights for us compared to the present moment?"
The lies people like you propagate here is nothing short of amusing.
How is this logical?
The libertarian candidate is not going to win so I will vote for a system that will ensure the libertarian candidate will never exist?
The libertarian candidate is not going to win so I will vote for a system that will ensure the libertarian candidate will never exist?
One of the two major parties is actively working toward a voting system that mathematically allows for more than 2 viable parties. Just saying.
I'm saying vote authoritarian to have your rights taken away.
Why would anyone do that?
Something like 30% of the population does exactly that in lockstep
And those are the REAL libertarians
"Incoming ""No True Scotsman"" in 3... 2... 1..."
"In partisan politics as long as it is ""your guy"" doing the dirt then dirt is good. Real libertarians will oppose it fake libertarian Trump supporters will make excuses."
I'm okay with terrorists dying
Like this?
"And any unconstitutional attack is justified by the word ""terrorism"". It used be communism but the new boogeyman anything goes in fighting it word is terrorism"
"Exactly.
I'm 100% anti-war and want all troops that aren't in the US to be completely withdrawn but why is Trump killing a terrorist a bad thing while Obama killing a terrorist is good?"
"If Obama was president the media would be praising him for Soleimani's assassination, and rightly so."
"If Trump supported the Green New Deal, the left would suddenly be against it because the only thing they care about is going against Trump."
I know trumpists are master projectionists but unfortunately the facts say you're full of shit.
Republicans fall in line and do and believe what they're told. Democrats are more capable of thinking for themselves.
"<a href=""https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt</a>"
The reason you think others behave that way is because <em>you</em> behave that way and need to justify it
Democrats are some of the least capable of thinking for themselves these are the people who think Bernie is going to make all their wishes come true they get a wish list and happily wait for their party to pull a win. Democrats are the people who will literally end someones political career over some stupid sex scandal or a sexual joke and things done by people decades ago they bring it up as a mob mentality to crush anyone they find unfavorable and they have done it with some of their best candidates like Franken for example an ex comedian making a joke had to hang up the gloves because Democrats are mindless comedic hemophiliacs.
Also this guy has a point if trump was in the same situation obama was in with bin laden he would have been criticized for it and obama would have been praised for this recent strike we all know it. Everyone just hates trump and refuses to acknowledge when he does something good or something most other presidents would have done before him.
oh shit the facts are against me I better pound the table
That's a lot of words to be demonstrably wrong. Especially coming after the demonstration.
Amazing.
Whats wrong about it? No one was bitching about borders when obama was president then trump gets in office and its an issue. Obama bombs the shit out of the middle east no one cares trump does it must be world war 3 right? Obama deports more people than any other president no one cares but when trump gets in office and deports half as many people boom its a problem. You Democrats act like your right all the time because everything that your candidate does is a godsend and anything Republicans do is literally the work of the antichrist right? Like your are so damn full of yourself and clearly politically uneducated because neither party are perfect and each party has members that are idiots and both of them are wrong from time to time you are just the kind of sheeple that picks a team and follows it without a single thought.
Ps you need to ya know actually give for instance and example of how someone is wrong otherwise what is the point of your comment other than to act superior on the internet.
I don't care about evidence my feelz are what counts
K
Ps you need to ya know actually give for instance and example of how someone is wrong otherwise what is the point of your comment other than to act superior on the internet.
"Coming from the guy who literally ignored the evidence to repeat what that evidence disputed, that's pretty funny."
If you can address the collections of polls feel free. If not stop pretending they don't exist
"Your ""evidence"" is an imgur meme with a chart that could be from anywhere. How many people where polled and are these the exact same people answering both polls. Who is credited for this poll i cant find any of that in an imgur post so its about as invalid as a 5 year olds political commentary. "
Did you get an education? One of the first things you learn in English class when writing papers is your sources but here you are trying to peddle a meme as if it was a fact
"our ""evidence"" is an imgur meme with a chart that could be from anywhere. "
It's an album of over 50 polls each with the name of the pollster watermarked on them lmao. And they show a consistent trend of republicans doing their masters bidding and democrats thinking for themselves
You're so desperate kid. 
Meanwhile the evidence you've provided is: MUH FEE-FEES
lol pathetic.
Like I said. The facts are against you so you pound the table
cant find any of that
"It literally says it on almost if not every single one 😂 theres news media, pew, gallup, American national election studies"
So you're either blind as a bat or lying and I think I know which one 🤣
Give the link to the site or it doesn't matter it isn't a source unless you give me the link i shouldn't need to dig through the internet to find your shit. Also its just a poll that doesn't prove anything other than two sides disagree on something what a shocker thanks for that valuable information buddy i didnt realize the two parties disagreed till now thank you. 
Also what are you trying to even prove that isn't your own elitist subjective opinion. You are writing off 50% of people who all have their own problems and reasons for voting a certain way i didnt even vote for the guy but i have enough of a mind to realize shitting on everyone for their choices gets nothing done.
"What concerns people is that Soleimani was a high ranking government official of a sovereign country (which is internationally recognized as such). Regardless of whether he’s the good guy or not, killing him inches us a lot closer to war than killing a terrorist from the Taliban or ISIS."
"The only acceptable use of force is in defense, or as a form of punishment for violating the NAP (such as jailing a murderer). VERY few libertarians believe in capital punishment, even after a fair trial, since there is the possibility of error. AFAIK, there was no trial in absentia, so even the most lenient libertarian is going to have major issues with this. In the libertarian view, this was the assassination of a foreign entity conducted on foreign soil without due process. This in no way promotes or supports Soleimani (he's most probably an evil bastard roasting in Hell), but the morality of the process isn't dependant on the morality of the victim."
the morality of the process isn't dependant on the morality of the victim. 
This is what I believe. It's the difference between right and wrong.
"So if the attack on Soleimani was green lighted by the senate you would be in support of it? So, your issue with the attack is that red tape was ducked?"
"Partially. Even if the Senate had approved, it would still need to be proven in a court (even if in absentia) that Soleimani was guilty of a crime worthy of summary execution, in order to give it any credence of morality. Please note, this has nothing to do with legality, but rather the morality of the action from the libertarian perspective. As I also noted, very few libertarians accept government execution as moral under any circumstances, so I'm trying to give it the greatest leniency I can."
"I’m not as far pacifist as most libertarians on war (I believed war with ISIS was justified), but Iran is a perpetual case of us throwing shit at them and then pretending their retaliations were unprovoked."
"Until I see a case of Iran doing something to the US (not Israel or Saudi) that isn’t blatant self defense, I see no reason for the states to attack them."
Soleimani was not doing good things for the world. I’ll never say he was. But did any of what he did justify the US attack? Hell no
Libertarians are anti trump. Neocons calling themselves libertarians are pro trump.
"I like this, I like you"
Fucking mind blowingly retarded as usual from Trump
"It was an illegal assassination, done in an idiotic way, that will lead to a lot more people being killed in the long run.  And Trump did it for capricious and self-serving reasons."
I supported candidate Trump for his noninterventionist platform but never voted for him because of his embrace of Sheldon Anderson. Trump’s supporters are in a personality cult where Trump is this godlike being who plans everything 20 moves ahead of everyone else so of course they trust the plan unquestioningly. Trump’s been anti-Iran since he was elected so him choosing to assassinate a high ranking popular Iranian general who made his reputation fighting ISIS in Iraq territory (which only the redcaps believe isn’t an act of war) at the behest of his Israeli backers isn’t too surprising.
"It did not surprise me at all because this is what governments and ""leaders"" do."
"""Everyone does it"" -- a classic excuse for shitty behavior."
Where's the excuse? Ok just said they weren't surprised
"""Everyone does it"" is about a half-sentence away from ""so it's OK if I do it, too.""  This is why ""both sides"" is frequently used as a defense to shitty political behavior."
Spend some time around kids or shitty adults and you'll see it plenty.
"I don't think OP is condoning it as okay, he seems to be condemning the rest of the leaders for similar actions."
"That's exactly what I was saying, sorry for not being more clear, thank you for support."
"Agreed, still not what OP said though"
"When we finally got bin Laden, seal team six essentially assassinated him. They were on the ground taking fire so it’s more engaged and self preserving to fire back and kill him in the process. "
I’m fine with the drone method as long as there aren’t innocent casualties because it keeps us safer. 
"All that said, taking out a terrorist who is bent on killing Americans is an act of defense. Political agendas muck up the picture beyond all recognition. If Pres. Obama had ordered and accomplished this same action, Republicans would be calling him out for assassination. "
I’m glad Soleimani is  gone and no troops were at risk to do so. But we need to be out of the area and fixing what ails our country here. 
"War is FUBAR every time whether considered necessary or not. But we do need to balance that with not letting the Stalins, Hitlers,  Pol Pots, etc. exterminate our fellow humans. "
Impossible crazy world. I do not envy those in positions that require decisions like these. Just hope they balance real implications before taking action.
"The thing is, Soleimani is a completely different animal than Bin Laden and Baghdadi."
Just flat out invalide comparisons to make.
"To overtly characterize Soleimani as a terrorist akin to Bin Laden and Baghdadi is completely irrational, ignores the definition of terrorism, and ignores the facts."
Soleimani associated with and did covert opts alongside paramilitary and militia groups in the Middle East. This is true.
But he is a state actor (1) and he did not overly target civilians (2) throughout his career.
These two things make Soleimani no different from any other state sponsored military or covert operative in the region.
"Any definition of terrorism is broad, but usually includes some key elements. One of those elements being that the terrorist is a ""non-state"" actor. Soleimani was the #2 leader in the Iranian military. He is a military target. Another element includes the explicit and overt targeting of civilians with the intent of causing fear and terror in the population. Soleimani is covert ops. His entire purpose is to remain discrete. This is contradictory to the entire goal of terrorism, which is to cause public fear through a public act in a population of civilians."
"Civilians have died, but any military general in the Middle East has killed civilians as collateral. Soleimani has never targeted US civilian targets. Whereas any other ""terrorist"" has had to literally behead and bomb civilians, journalists, etc. explicitly to earn that label."
"For <em>some</em> reason (which I think we know) the standard for earning his badge of ""terrorist"" is much lower for Soleimani than for any other deserved ""terrorist""."
War is just a pretext for the state to curb your liberties.
The only war I will over support is a war to defend our sovereign territory from attack and invasion.
"Iraq war vet and die hard libertarian here.  We shouldn't be involved in the middle east.  Yet...we are, and shoulding all over ourselves doesn't make that not so.  The thing that gets me is when the pawns get killed, nobody bats an eye.  Airstrikes is a daily occurrence over there.  Back in 2015 when we did an airstrike at a hospital that killed 42 and injured more, nobody gave a shit.  It didn't go viral, etc.  "
"Meanwhile we've been unofficially at war with Iran for a very long time.  They've been active in Iraq since I was there in the oughts, and continue to vie for their influence to take power there.  It's an oversimplification to call it a proxy war (one could argue it's more parallel to when europe was engulfed in protestant v. catholic war...), but it's been a thing.  I've seen official estimates that almost 1 out of 5 people killed in Iraq were due to Iran proxies, and it sounds about right based on my personal experiences."
"Do I think we should be out of there, yeah.  But we're not.  And if we want to do a show of force by going after the actual guys in power instead of their pawns...well, as someone who ended my deployment early due to injuries from Iran backed insurgents, I'd frankly rather see more of the people playing the  Game of Thrones (literally they both exchanged taunting tweets with GoT themes leading up to this) actually kill each other instead of the little guys."
"The reason this story went viral, and why everyone is talking about it is that 1: it represents a significant change in the US foreign policy in the middle east.  Simply put, it is changing the game.  Iran is shocked.  Our allies are shocked.  And now everyone must adapt.  And 2: it fits people's political narratives.  This is true for the leftists, who with a republican in power want to call him a war monger for perpetuating the same military actions that Obama did.  It is also true for the Republicans that want to call Trump tough on foreign terrorists.  "
"A lot of this kind of stuff between nations, if you put it into game theory terminology, is a game of chicken.  By definition, the classic game of chicken is framed on the game like from grease: two people driving directly at each other to see who gets scared and swerves first to avoid hitting each other.  You see this same basic model playing out over a lot of pissing contests between two dudes talking crap, and while more is at stake, it's often not different in terms of strategy when two leaders are playing games of brinksmanship.  So it's the same core game here: both sides do not want it to go to war, yet both sides benefit if they can escalate to the point that the other side backs down to avoid war so that they don't have to lose face by backing down.  In the classic academia version of chicken, the optimal strategy is actually to remove your steering wheel, and make sure the other player knows you did it.  At this point, they know you will not swerve to avoid collision no matter what, and it becomes their ideal move to lose face to avoid it.  When we get back to pissing contests between two bullies trying to act tough, what we normally see is ""yeah, he's so crazy though"" to tell the other side he won't behave rationally.  I personally think a lot of Trumps moves are exactly that: he's playing the crazy guy because it means the other people can't depend on him to act rationally.  One can argue he isn't playing - which you can counter argue means the strategy works even better for him.  "
"Regardless, the real world doesn't work as predictably as the mathematical models academics use for game theory, and playing an optimal strategy is still rolling the dice to see what happens.  There's a lot of variables that nobody can plan for - how will China, Russia, etc. react?  Will the increased pressure have Iranian people trying to revolt against their government?  Will our allies make a show of not having our backs on this?  Like it or hate it, Trump is the guy in a position to make the decision of how the US responds when Iran escalates.  Bottom line is it's bold...and we'll have to use hindsight with 2020 vision (pun intentional) to tell if this was a bold and decisive move that cowed an enemy or a blunder that escalated us into a war.   People trying to make that call before seeing how it plays out are just projecting their assumptions and/or agenda."
Murder is murder. It doesn't magically become okay when the murderer has a fancy title. I don't believe the president will fare well on judgement day.
I'm honestly numb to this shit nowadays. It doesn't surprise me that something like this happened. 
Every day I think becoming a hardcore prepper is the way to go. Acquire supplies and wait for the storm to come.
"He was a terrorist and a murderer whose actions deprived the life and liberty of thousands, including Americans."
"If you're the kind of person who can't rejoyce that such a monster will no longer be able to victimize more innocents in the future, I'm not sure what to tell you."
"Top DOD officials were stunned that this happened. Regardless of reason, should the president be able to unilaterally decide to assassinate a high-ranking and much-loved (in his own country) general? "
"While yes, it means that one person is gone, it has also inflamed the tensions in a country that is overall not too fond of America. Do you think this action could create more extremists than it eliminated?"
I'm OK with terrorists dying.
And american civilian military leaders aren't terrorist?
Normal people can't be terrorists.
Watch out socialists!!
I see what you did there
Having stood up to 'Corn Pop' has emboldened him throughout his political career.
So Republicans like him then?
Watching them tear each other apart over who is more woke is amusing.
"Biden was always a warmonger, there’s nothing “woke” about that."
Watching the “woke” ones tear each other apart is amusing.
What does that even mean? Being anti war is woke? Who’s woke here?
So were most democrats. In fact only a few voted against the war in Iraq.
"I mean almost a 130 Democrats voted against it in the house alone, so curious how you figure"

The LP is shitty. I support the ideology
"I can understand that. However this guy bashes both the left and right. He also says that if just a third of his listeners joined the LP right now, they could take over the party and make it everything it should be. He covers current events and explains the flaws in everything not libertarian."
Please don't put lies in the title.   Especially if you are a fake troll.
Lie?
Good. Fuck CNN.
"CNN has agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount with Nick Sandman, the student from Covington Catholic who was smeared and defamed by various personalities and networks."
While some are claiming that this is a defeat as they won't go to trial we need to consider the context around the lawsuits.
"CNN and Washington Post tried to get the suits dismissed but a judge recently allowed the suit against WaPo to enter discovery, meaning it was moving forward. Sandmann's legal team was preparing more lawsuits and was gaining ground in the battle."
"Presumably CNN saw the signs on the wall and knew they were going to lose and decided to cave. I can only assume considering the major support and advantage of the Convington student that CNN paid out a very hefty sum, though the full amount is undisclosed."
The battle is not over. Sandmann's team is going after Nathan Phillips and other outlets.
"At the same time Devin Nunes, Lara Logan, and others are suing various news outlets for smears and fake news. Defamation lawsuits are popping up as people no longer will sit idly by as their names and reputations are tarnished."
David Nunes is suing a fake cow and his fake mom.
Good for them. Tim Pool is still garbage.
He has his moments
Jesus what a fucking moron
Imagine thinking Trump has literally any credibility whatsoever
Wow man bored much. You’ve been following me around all morning
You think Trump has credibility?
I’d say it’s between 1% and 99%.
Actionable items:
1-
2-
3-
4-    NATO to invade Iran?
"Me and the boys watched it live during lunch, we thought the declaration of war was coming lol."
Yep
Because Saudi Arabia doesn't like them and neither does Israel
Edit: Suppose I need to mention my comment was quickly made as a witty response and is only semi-serious as the article itself is a joke
"""all my friends hate him so he's the bad guy"""
what a leader we have lol
This is USA policy on Iran that goes way longer not just few past years.
"Thing is, Trump seems to like dictators we used to oppose."
"Some would call it realpolitik. A majority of Syrians for example prefers Assad to the available opposition... Why would you oppose someone who's got the support of his people, especially when none of the alternatives are actually worth supporting?"
Some would call it realpolitik. 
"From reading his twitter and hearing him speak, it seems more like narcissism and dementia."
So why kill Soleimani? I mean other than to distract from the impeachment. 
Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. He's weak and he's ineffective. So the only way he figures that he's going to get reelected — and as sure as you're sitting there — is to start a war with Iran.

"He got elected based on a more rational approach. If he starts a war he'll lose some, or even a lot, of the voters that voted for him in 2016. He's going to need to show brinkmanship here if he wants to walk away unscathed. Not sure if he'll be able to."

We don't elect most people to the presidency tho
yes we happen to only elect presidents to the presidency 🤔
"No, half of the time we elect people who are not presidents to the presidency."
The word president has a d you cucks clearly it’s made for democrats. When will you republican shills learn that only one political party can have a good president and all their presidents are good ffs.
You do realize it also has an R in it right?
"Whoa mind fucked.... President only has the N, no L, which is why the closest we will ever see to a LN president will be shills that sell out to the Republicans (it has the r AND the d)."
Your comment is better without the explanation at the bottom. I thoroughly enjoyed it though it makes me wonder if you actually think I don’t know that president has an r.
I do not. It was more for the casual passerby that wasn't wholly paying attention hahaha
That's kind of how being a human works
Trump doesn't like Muslims that prefer religious extremism and dont loan him money
Ya he prefers religious extremists like the Saudis and Israelis who will loan him money
who likes NK?
"I remember Trump making fun of Kim on twitter and calling him rocket man and ""short and fat"""
Not to mention China is basically a dictatorship.
Do you remember Trump then praising Kim and talking of the beautiful letter?
It is satire.
Their leader has a lot of friends
"There are totally legitimate reasons to see Iran as an enemy, but unfortunately you're probably right that this is as deep as President Trump's understanding of the situation goes. If it weren't, his attitude towards Pooh Bear and Rocket man would be fundamentally different than what we actually see in practice."
Let's see. 
"Sponsors terrorists, believes the US is the great satan, more... contentious than NK, just to name a few valid reasons."
There's  a lot more to it than you're letting on.
And you think Saudi Arabia and Israel have never sponsored terrorism? Lmao

They were carrying out deliberate terrorist attacks aimed at civilians, according to the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/02/world/bomb-at-plo-office-kills-at-least-50.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NYT</a> and the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/09/19/shadowy-group-claims-responsibility-for-3rd-blast-in-lebanon/eb7d64cc-b3c8-456a-a7dc-ebafbb43da6a/"" rel=""nofollow"">Washington Post</a>"
"The terrorist group that executed these attacks, called the ""Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners"", was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/magazine/how-arafat-eluded-israels-assassination-machine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">confirmed to have been created</a> by the former Israeli Defence Forces Chief of Staff, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Eitan"" rel=""nofollow"">Rafael Eitan</a>."
"They absolutely fired missiles at Israel I was old enough to watch it on TV with my own eyes. Why aren't you concerned with the thousands of Christians killed by Hezbollah or Hamas's mistreatment of its people.  Your looking at specific scenarios out of context and ignore the hundreds of ethnic groups who live there and fight it out with everyone. No one is innocent there!  Have you even been to the middle east? Do you even know how that place works? Doesn't seem like it! Look, I see the narrative your pushing bro..its kinda old"
Wow. We are quick to project... I said nothing about either country.
So... any statement not exactly fitting your narrative indicates my entire belief system... No wonder we're so polarized these days.
"Escape the group think, my friend."
"And your comment somehow does not defend the US decision to villainize Iran specifically? If the USA is truly concerned with Iran sponsoring terrorists, why is it still allied to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, the two states that were mentioned in the comment you replied to?"
"You make it seem like the American elites care about the people they claim to defend, while they turn a blind eye towards other terrorist attacks performed by their own allies."
"He was looking for any reason to throw Israel into the mix, dont get him started"
Because he wants a nuke and that would mean America couldn’t meddle in their affairs.
It is satire.
Israel is a dictatorship?
It's ok to not be very smart.
"Lol dude I'm not exactly a fan of Isreal, I asking a question."
How do they feel about North Korea and China. Trump loves those dictators.
Because they have oil and they won’t sell it. And because they won their revolution.
That is a fucking brilliant headline :)
The Onion could not have written it better!
-oh wait!
It is satire.
😆 ah... this is why I love this sub.
I see so many on Reddit defending this dictator (the Ayatollah)...
Fuck  Trump and Fuck the Ayatollah. 
Fuck all Authoritatians!
It’s a shame they are all so good at the divide and conquer strategy...
"Ike warned us when he left office that the presidency was becoming subservient to other powers that be. Think about how it is now. Or not, or you can just fight with fellow plebs."
"It's possible to avoid the divide &amp; conquer strategy by focusing on economic issues. You can approximate how authoritarian a country is by the type of taxes they raise. Free economies tax directly land and privileges, authoritarian countries indirectly tax transactions and receipts. Iran has no mandatory direct asset taxes on land owners, which means it's likely an authoritarian state run for the benefit of a landed elite."
"Dude that's a really interesting idea, can you reference any texts explaining this a little further? I've read George so I have an idea of the argument for solely land rents/taxes, but have always had a problem with how it would work in practice in rural areas where land value/tax is less of a motivator, these being the majority of land area. Any kind of fulcrum to balance land rents/taxes against transactional taxes like income and sales would help me understand the arguments better."
"<a href=""https://www.masongaffney.org/publications/L2Rent-Seeking_and_Global_Conflict.CV.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Rent-seeking &amp; Global Conflict</a>"
"Land prices are not wealth, they are capitalized future expected rents. Rents are wealth seized from others for charging for access to public domain. Future rents are expected only if there is uninterrupted state enforcement of exclusive use. To maximize income from rents, rent-seekers need state enforcement funded from some other revenue source than taxes on rents. So to maximize rents, they lobby for indirect taxes, which can be more easily shifted. Shifting the cost of enforcement of titles onto workers through indirect tax typically results in protests over shortages and high cost of living, which results in greater spending on enforcement and less on social services, and the government devolves into an authoritarian state, even if it was once a republic set up for the benefit of residents."
"In both rural and urban areas, you can assess fees by multiplying the parcel area by the local minimum cost of buying real estate per unit area in comparable locations, with the degree of similarity between locations determined by the minimum travel time between them, and with real estate prices collected from a real estate sales reporting requirement. Land-values taxes still work fine in rural areas, the price is just lower per area ie. the area is greater per price."
"Psheeoow for sure, but let me say your comment is better argued than the essay; only on page 3, but wanted to say thanks for the link homie!"
"Rights-respecting countries don't tax at all, because taxation is theft."
Rights-respecting countries tax earned income at 0% and unearned income at 100%. Consistent enforcement of individuals rights requires the establishment of a public government which levies fines on harm and fees on privileges. A direct tax on private claims to land and ideas assessed in proportion to demand for use of the fraction of the public domain which the private party has enclosed and excluded others from using is an ethical fee on privilege which is necessary to correct for harm done to others.
"Private claims and patents to land and ideas are not products of labor or wealth, they are claims to the exclusive use of a fraction of the public domain which allow the holder to coercively extract wealth from others. Legitimate governments need to fine those causing harm to pay restitution to those who are harmed. Legitimate governments must levy mandatory fees on private claimants which have removed assets from the public domain and return the fees via improvements to the public domain which increases the annual product of workers which only have access to economic opportunities left over."
And what can you do to prevent the representatives of the public trust from treating the public goods like their own private holdings?
"There can be no trust with bad faith, and there is no reason to have faith in people who are the monopoly on violence."
"In a pure republic, there are no representatives or agents, all business is conducted in public meetings held on common land where anyone who shows up is allowed to participate in the operation of government. In a democratic republic, residents elect recallable representative for short-terms to attend these meetings for them, so that the business of a public government can be extended across a larger land area."
"The U.S. is only at best a republic of second or third degree, an impure democratic republic. Residents originally had the right to recall federal officeholders at any time in the Articles of Confederation, but that was removed when the second constitution was written. The second constitution also added the bad power of the government to collect indirect taxes, when the first constitution said all federal taxes were going to be appraised according to relative land-values."
"In order to establish a public government in the United States, it's necessary to amend constitution so all federal officeholders including senators and presidents are recallable, and to appoint or hold direct elections for federal assessors to conduct regular appraisals of relative land-values."
I haven't seen anyone defend them.
I'm seeing a lot of people trying to paint the general like some kind of good guy/victim.
Find me any elected official or candidate that jerked off this general as much as Donald Trump jerked off Kim Jong Un. 
"Nobody has said any nice words about Soleimani, and it’s fucking ridiculous for conservatives to justify killing national leaders because they’re “bad people”. They stand and pose with the worst, most vile dictators in the world all the time."
"Agreed, if we killed everyone who needed killing the world would be a very empty place."
"Extrajudicial killings are supposed to be confined by law to self defense, and enemies of the state that threaten national security as defined by Congress."
I’m not sure there is a legal basis to order the killing of a North Korean general without an immediate  threat reason.  You have to have congress provide the definition and reason prior otherwise.
"I am unaware of immediate threat reasons being the justification, when the threat of death to an American is outside of 12 hours or so, without the combo of congressional authorization."
Congressional authorization is public and justified and gives the electorate the ability to object.
"Extrajudicial killings are supposed to be confined by law to self defense, and enemies of the state that threaten national security as defined by Congress."
Pre-fucking-cisely. If it's not in self defense or ordered by congress then maybe it shouldn't happen. Otherwise it's a matter for interpol or the local justice to decide.
First people to go: those who think they have the moral authority to decide who deserves to die.
is that hypocritical irony intentional? i hope it isn't because that's hilarious

this general as much as Donald Trump jerked off Kim Jong Un.
"If your confused, maybe you should consider who has access to nuclear weapons? That's a pretty big bargaining chip, I can see it affecting the tenor of thenegotiations."
"It's also showing potential nuclear states that they shouldn't give up their program. Once they do, the US will break the agreement and assassinate their leaders."
"Here lies the problem, we don't have the Intel that led to his killing. Was he actually the planner behind attacks in US personnel? If so, who cares who he is? Terrorist, world leader, if you are killing Americans your life should be in jeopardy. "
"On the other hand if he didn't and we just said that as pretext to drone strike an Iranian general, yeah I think most people have a problem with that."
"Given what even left wing media is saying, I have a feeling he was involved in attacks on Americans, and at the very least appeared to be involved in the embassy attack. This is one of those issues I feel people jump to conclusions months before the general public has all the facts."
"Our only evidence that he was plotting terrorist attacks on Americans is that the Trump administration says so. You know, the administration that's infamous for lying about everything including letters from the NFL and hurricane forecasts."
Fuck off with this wait and see shit.
"yea, this is a super objective take guys."
The fuck when did this sub become about implicitly trusting what the President says about the Middle East?
Implicitly trusting and dismissing out of hand are equally as asinine.
"When you're dealing with a pathological liar, it is usually safe to assume they are lying."
"The legal remedy is legal review and a Congressional investigation, that’s always been the check.  The assumption is that one of those two would be able to stop abuse of power, as both apply as a check. And a president doesn’t want to be caught murdering people for no good reason."
"The executive has always been empowered to protect the national security from an immediate threat.  But he has to prove it afterwards.  Otherwise if it’s possible to stop 911  but you only have minutes, someone has to legally wait for Congressional or Judiciary approval."
"And what happens when POTUS refuses to cooperate with the Congressional investigation, runs out the clock and then gets re-elected then continues to refuse to co-operate?"

I just find it incredible that people are so radicalized that it seems unthinkable to dislike both Trump and the Ayatollah.
"Everything about the way you speak/write comes across as yet another Trump supporter trying to play both sides. I don't know if that's true, but that's how it comes across. It's the buzzwords and adjectives."
idgaf about being “politically correct”
"Literally every time I hear this phrase, it’s uttered by someone who says some stupid shit and gets called out. Every time."
Why would Iranians rejoice seeing their own leader cry?   
You must be a brainwashed yank or something.
"Just a few weeks ago they were major protests in Iran demanding a regime change. The Ayatollah shut down the internet and gave the order to Suleimani to kill and 1,500 protesters were killed, more than 7,000 arrested. Iran is refusing to hand over the bodies to the family members."
"I agree, but this is satire."
That's actually kind of funny...

Does anybody like Iran? I get that what Trump did was entirely wrong but the Iranian government are also notorious for being <em>huge jerks</em>
"So, Trump is Iranian then?"
and the KSA isn't?
When did I say that or even imply it?
You didn't. The point of the article is to point out that Trump clearly doesn't hate Iran because of their human rights stances.
"I have Iranian in laws, so I'm a fan of Iranians"
what Trump did was entirely wrong
What makes you think that?
"I liked that they finally let inspectors in, and heavily cut back their nuclear program. I have no idea why the GOP and Trump felt the need to pull out of it. "
"Are we safer or better off with Iran today or under the agreement? I feel the agreement was a good starting point, and it was also planned to up the restrictions more after 10 years of the agreement. Sadly it didn't last 5."
I agree with everything you said but that doesn’t change the fact that Iran is one of the biggest state sponsors of terrorism in the world.
What are you talking about?
Iran has been agitating in the middle for the last 10 year even with Obama in office. They have also been hard at work developing nuclear technology despite us paying them money to stop being meanies (democrat foreign policy). We have been also running all types of secret ops on them and killing their nuclear scientists
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Iranian_nuclear_scientists"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Iranian_nuclear_scientists</a>"
Your priests at the church of the democratic party have lied to you.
"Because it's Trump's mission to undo everything Obama did, whether it was actually a good idea or not.  Obama could have cured cancer and Trump would ban the cure."
"It’s purely because the deal was made by Obama. It was a flawed deal but it was actually working. Critiquing the deal is fair, but do fucks sake improve it don’t destroy it. Trump complained that the deal was bad and would lead us to war so in response he shredded the deal without a negotiation and then blew up one of their military leaders in and attempt to do....I honestly have no idea."
"You should have let him launder more money through your properties in Azerbaijan and Turkey. Or rented entire floors of his hotels and never used them. Or undersign his shady loans through Deutsche Bank. Then he'd probably suck your dick, Khomeini."

Probably because other dictators were focus on killing their own people not other people in other countries.
"We don't really care if NK choose to sink their country/people to hell, as long as they don't shoot missiles around."
"We don't really care if Iran choose to sink their country/people to hell, as long as they don't kill people all around middle east and EU Africa and worlds."
Does this make sense to Libertarians?
We want to get out of Middle East and let every countries focus on killing their own people only. We don't want to be the policeman of the world.
Bullshit we don't.  We love being the policemen of the world.  We've been doing it for almost 100 years at this point.
"Ah, Borowitz, confusing older relatives with not-funny Onion articles since 2005."
"Iran is hardline. They won't negotiate their way out of tariffs or threats. Trump is right that they will ultimately only respond to force or appeasement. But I don't think targeting cultural landmarks will earn him points with... anyone, really."

"One of the two things I said, appeasement."

"I am a left libertarian, but money in politics is not as effective as you purport it to be."
Left libertarian is just like right libertarian. Not a real thing. 
You’re either libertarian or your not. Adding the word right or left in front of it is stupid.
Right Libertarians aren’t likely to get the political favors needed to subvert their business competition.
"Better yet, why not move to a like minded community (maybe near Ron Paul’s district) and add an electorate to Congress so the lone libertarian doesn’t have to stand alone?"

I’m not an anarchist but I’d say that they are loyal to the country itself. They want what they think is best for the country and the people. I mean that’s the whole idea of a patriot someone who wants what’s best for the country even if they have different ideals. That’s just my opinion I could easily be wrong.
"I understand. I'd ask what is a country? Is it the land, the set of laws within that geographic boundary, the people, or the culture and values? "
"People in America are not real loyal. Liberals and conservatives hate each other. America no longer has a unified culture, value system, or national identity. Even the core laws, The Constitution, no longer represent a unifying value system. All that seems left is the geographic boundaries. Is that where patriotism stems from, dirt?"
"I won’t always feel loyal to my government, my loyalty is to my God first and foremost, then my family, my home, my people, my heritage, and my country. "
"This Idea... we all feel this..... but then again, we <em>are</em> all Texans 😉... and every other true red blooded American Patriot out there. As much as they speak, we watch. The  American man is the watchman and when our own calls on us, we will dutifully answer that call... <em>and don’t you think you can mess with our women, they’ll put a whippin’ on your ass quicker’n you can have the time to know what to do with yourself. They can handle their own round these parts, they’s tough! Don’t mean us men make em do it though. Us men, well we don’t know nothin’ to tell us any different, so we think we’re tougher! Trust me, ain’t nobody wanna get caught all up in the middle of this here pissin’ match we’re having amongst ourselves.... Lest we may join together and take all the frustration out on them.</em>"
Some might argue that a sense of national identity and shared values among the population is essential in order to successfully remove the state without chaos ensuing.
I’m an ancap and I think patriotism/nationalism are retarded and serve no purpose regarding individual liberty.
"Well, I admire your honestly."
No. That’s an oxymoron.
Thanks Trump for letting us know all that shit from the Bush and Obama years about setting up a sovereign democracy in Iraq was all bullshit

Disclaimer: not a libertarian 
For my understanding they have no issue with it. It’s a part of a functioning society. Unless you’re an anarchist or something like that but I would think that a libertarian would want the rights of his fellow man to be upheld. And what better way to do that then by a jury of your peers.
I see no issue with it. It’s our responsibility as part of ensuring our right to a trial of our peers. 
"If you want to be judged by a jury, you should be willing to occasionally participate as a juror. "
"With rights and the protection of those rights, come responsibilities."
"Unless you are in a jury, you have NO CHANCE to nullify a unfair or illegal law."
"As a constitutionalists, I get the reason why we do it, it's the people vs ""      "", and we are going to take away the person's rights. If I dont do it, who will. Since its almost voluntary, it's mostly older retired people."
I would be ok with it if they made it completely voluntary for the individual. There are enough NCIS fans in the US to do jury duty voluntarily
I'm fine with jury duty being a part of the social contract.
social contract.
Is that even a libertarian thing? Usually that includes things libertarians wont want.
"Libertarians don't usually support the idea of the ""social contract"" since it implies being forced into something just by nature of being born, which you had no choice in."
"without some sort of social contract you aren't talking about being a libertarian, that's anarchy."
"Government's sole role should be to protect the negative rights of all individuals. The guaranteed positive right to this protection, unfortunately, requires some infringement of our rights to exist, namely taxation. "
"If one is accused by the state or others, they should have the positive right to defense against the accusation. This means, like taxation, that the government should provide a defense attorney and an impartial jury at the cost of a slight infringement of our rights. "
"In short, if a government must exist, so must small violations of our rights. These violations, however, should be minimized by low taxation, voluntarily hired defense attorneys, and speedy jury trials."
Courts should be in the private sector and those cases that cannot be  settled through arbitration should have professional jurists preside

"I actually didn't know about our support and complicity in SAVAK being set up in Iran.  Just one more reason they are absolutely justified to hate our guts.  Shit is embarrassing to me as an American, and the fact that so many blindly hate them based on our propaganda is revolting"
Why are they starting more fires?
The demand for climate change disasters is outstripping the supply.
So its like hatecrime in the US?
No. There are just arsonists. It happened every year
Exactly. It's eco-terrorism. Environmental fundamentalists are destroying the Earth to get their way. It's just like all the fake hate crimes. This is a pattern on the Left. The ends justify the means.
"How in the world do you know that? Arsonists are driven by a eco terrorist narrative, do you have ANY proof of that at all with over 200 people arrested who had ties to these eco-terrorist groups? "
"Oh wait this is PJW, a known Alex Jones propagandist nut job...let's take a quick sanity break. Ahh On Monday, the NSW Police confirmed 24 people had been charged over alleged deliberately-lit bushfires. "
Compare the journalism:
"<a href=""https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/118623458/australian-bushfires-cops-and-arson-unit-round-up-24-alleged-firestarters-in-nsw"">https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/118623458/australian-bushfires-cops-and-arson-unit-round-up-24-alleged-firestarters-in-nsw</a>"
"This problem is bad enough, without listening to kooks like PJW!"
Wouldn’t we know by now. All we need is to look at the social media of the 24 arrested and see if there are common themes.
"I can't say I know why people are setting fires. It was blamed on climate change until it was discovered to be arson. So why isn't that considered crazy now?  What does explain it?  It seems to be a coordinated effort of some kind. Yes, Alex Jones is crazy but left-wingers can be loons as well."
There are arsonists every year. It just happens
Maybe solely blamed on climate change by celebrities or uninformed citizens. Who cares?
Actual science suggests they are made worse by the drier and hotter environment.
"Ok captain science, explain this study from 2007."
"<a href=""https://imgur.com/67rHmAO"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/67rHmAO</a>"
Science doesn’t care what you believe. These guys predictions are dead nuts on the money.
Because it's a coordinated attack. 200 random people do not coincidentally get pissed off and decide to light a bush on fire in locations that will cause the largest wildfire in almost half a century. They also don't coordinate such a crime because they felt like all that dry brush was just too unsightly.
"It's a form of terrorism, and given that none of them had gone out and claimed responsibility/published a manifesto, the only reasonable conclusion lacking hard evidence is that they wanted exactly what happened: for the fires to be blamed on climate change."
This is what happens when you have opinions about something you know nothing about. There are arsonists every year. Out of 10 million plus people you are going to get some wastes of skin that light fires in bushfire prone areas in bushfire conditions
"Yeah, you might get a few at a time. We see that happen often enough. But almost 200 at the same time? That's not random chance, that's eco terrorism."
There are arsonists every season and you don't know why they lit their fires
"Or accept the science and stop setting fires to say it was all man made, when it started from extreme heat from climate change?"
Or maybe accept that a combination of the Indian Ocean Dipole plus decades of poor forestry and stamping out fires as soon as they start created a tinder box half the size of Australia? 
"That's one of the problems with climate change, if you blame everything on it, people stop believing it's real."

"Fake news, climate change deniers setting fires to protect big oil."
Perfect satire
"I wonder how things like election suppression, climate change, and reforming health care became anti <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a> issues."
Election suppression:
"Is democracy an important factor to libertarians?  I would say so.  There is an argument both ways here. Then again, claiming it is racist to require an I.D. to vote in U.S. Elections (which you did not do, I know) is disingenuous at best, and really the only argument I have heard of those who are against it.  Holds no merit, and seems like a rare regulation that actually involves common-sense.   Seem more like a thinly veiled attempt to get non-citizens to vote, or not allow fully documented and fair elections, which I am fairly skeptical of actually existing. "
​
​
Climate change (advocacy?): 
"Haven't met a libertarian who actively WANTS to cause damage to the environment.  The question out is 'to what extent do humans have a role', which not been appropriately approached by the scientific community due to advocacy and funding for those who push that 'humans do, in fact cause climate change'.  Especially, when the reforms needed to adjust and correct such doomsday predictions involve government take-over of a wide swathe of privately owned business, and basically implementation socialism. "
​
​
So..... Free healthcare:
"Government take-over of private healthcare industry is the worry with libertarians and when 'reform' wears that potential future, it is opposed.  It is practically antithesis to libertarian values and ideals."
"Fun points, thanks."
"My post wasn't that these aren't debatable or one side has better merits than the other, its that these topics will immediately put a <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>-er on defense.  Its like if I say ""yeah, maybe if we can make our healthcare process better"" (which seems like the most generic but easily agreeable thing to say), <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>-ers will think I'm personally attacking them."
"Totally understandable.  These are the reasons that I say, or why I go on the defense when they are mentioned.  The reforms, regulations, or stances held by prominent law makers on the left state their plans fairly clearly and they almost all involve bigger federal government, more taxation, and less individual freedoms.  "
"I get what you’re saying but it seems euphemistic to boil it down, libertarians are anti-climate change reform, anti-healthcare reform, or anti-etc etc.  Does that sorta make sense?"
"Also, the ‘defensiveness’, at least in this sub, comes from the fact that many left wing subs (some right wing subs, but not nearly to the same extent) have tried to basically take over this sub and control the conversation.  So, strong actions have been met with strong opinions."
Or its kids being kids and starting fires in the woods.
"What a load of garbage. Arson is always a significant problem, going back many decades. Some people light fires because they want to be a hero, some people light fires because they are mentally unwell, some people light fires because they want to kill people."
So quit it with the bullshit.
"I'd believe one or two arsonists. I might even believe a group of 10 arsonists did it for the lulz and it got out of hand. But 200 of them? No, there was ideology behind it."
"Some people just like to watch the flames, the way they dance, the way they move from here to there, to and fro, the way they beautifully multiply. The orange glow is so soothing and sings a song of love. It calls out for more. "
<em>That's what I heard anyway. From a friend.</em>
"<em>ring ring</em> Hello, crimestoppers? Yes, I have something to report...."
"This is some galaxy brain shit.  This is why the right is so fucking stupid, they can find one fake hate crime, talk about it over and over, doing news story after news story and they can convince some idiot in rural who-gives-a-shit that all hate crimes are fake.  Now we have a bunch of idiots who are willing to believe that 200 cases of arson means that it must be eco-terrorists trying to prove climate change is happening (which it obviously isn't because that's just big science coming to take away your truck).  This is so depressingly stupid."

"Of those, 13% are started deliberately, and 37% are suspicious. That means 31,000 Australian bushfires are either arson, or suspected arson, every year."
"Guess its 31,000 fires started by climate activists, huh?  You guys are retarded.  What percentage of climate activists would be willing to start a fire, how many in a cell willing to plan one?  Does this mean there's hundreds of thousands of militant climate activists in Australia?  How come they aren't voting?"
"Yeah, only 200 people deliberately started wildfires. No big deal at all. Has nothing to do with all these wildfires."
"Now all we have to do is make the logic leap to eco terrorists with no evidence, based on an article from some right wing propaganda rag site."
Fuck you. You are so full of shit

You simply defined fire season
That isn't proof of global warming. That's the definition of a fire season.
Brush fires alone don't prove climate change and nobody claims they do outside of the strawmen being erected in this thread. But the increase in frequency and severity can be tied to climate change as hotter temperatures and increased drought exacerbate wildfires.
"The point is the increase in frequency and longer durations of drought, not the fact there's a ""fire season""."
[deleted]
"I want to tell you you're wrong, but I don't want to hear any rebuttal"
Except in this particular fire season the entire country is burning to the ground
Brush fires don't prove global warming but in the modern age all natural disasters are used as a means to push the climate change agenda.  Little to no proof is ever presented.  Speculation is accepted as undeniable fact.  
If you look on Reddit you would think the fuckin PM of Australia directly caused the brush fires and if he just took climate change more seriously they could have been prevented.  It's gotten insane.
Little to no proof is ever presented.  
"There is absurd amount of climate and environmental scientists in various specific fields that have provided an insane amount of data to support climate change. As someone in the computer science field, it would be pure stupidity to not listen to me or my peers if/when we form a consensus on our subject matter. When I want to know about food I listen to chefs, when I want to know about warfare I listen to generals, when I want to know about coal I ask a miners/geologists ... so it stands to reason that one consults environmental scientists on matters concerning the environment."
​
If you look on Reddit you would think the fuckin PM of Australia directly caused the brush fires  
Every thread on this topic I've read shows that citizens and redditors main issue is the response and lack of action of the Australian PM. From lack of effort in assisting emergency crews to general response to the threat they are actively under. We Americans do the exact same thing to our leadership when we must deal with massive fire storms. If the Governor of California poo poo'd massive fires that occur in California and didn't send more manpower and funds to combat the threat there would be hell to pay. Rightfully so.
Little to no proof is ever presented.
"I think you meant to say ""I don't read the proof when it's presented to me"""
There was a famous scientific report written in the 90’s which states that the fire season will be longer by 2020 as a result of climate change.
"On the golden globes last night all the hollyweirdos were calling this a ""climate disaster"""
"At this point it is. Even if the cause is not climate related, the sheer amount of smoke, heat, and energy from the fire has formed it's own weather patterns increasing thunderstorms and wind."
"It is a disaster FOR the climate, although it is not directly caused BY the climate. However, one could argue that it may have been exacerbated by the amount of warming that has already taken place due to longer drought periods and less rainfall overall. The amount of sequestered CO2 being released by the fires is certainly very concerning."
It is climate related so they are technically correct however the auto ignition temp of wood wouldn’t be reached in record heats. So not climate change related.
the auto ignition temp of wood wouldn’t be reached in record heats. So not climate change related.
this has got to be the dumbest shit i've read in a long time
"Australia is having the worst droughts the continent has ever seen, ever. Mix that with the highest temps ever. And Australia's summer just started a few weeks ago, so expect even hotter temps and prolonged droughts. "
"That's what's making these brushfires even worse. When you add government mismanagement over the last several years, it makes it a global phenomenon."
"It's not the absolute worst drought we've ever had, My Grandmother remembers the river at her farm turning salty in the 60's 30k's inland as the crow flies prompting the local council to change their water supply pump point, anecdotal I know, The Darling ceased to flow for 10 years back at the turn of last century and before that too, leaving the paddle steamers high and dry loaded with wool. This one isn't great and I hope it eases quickly for my mates who are on the land (my brother already lost his job on it) but too say its the worst is a big call by far."
​
"Temperature is weird too, they say it's the hottest and maybe I'm getting used to it, but it seems like a cooler summer for me than in years gone by, maybe there's higher more localized extremes and my local district is bucking the trend?"
"Well im glad it seems cool for you mate in your little town. But that means fuck all.

"Wait, you're actually under the impression that scientists think bushfires are caused by the ambient temperature reaching the ignition point of wood so that they literally spontaneously combust?"
"Wow! Congratulations on being the first person to debunk the claim that the average temperature in Australia is over 375°C (700°F). There's definitely no other way that temperature could lead to increased fires, especially since the concept of drought and dryness is fake news."

Good bot
in the modern age all natural disasters are used as a means to push the climate change agenda.  
This is because extreme weather events and disasters are becoming quantifiably worse and more frequent and pointing out these disasters is one of the best ways of showing people the effects of climate change and pushing people towards action on an issue that's been ignored for decades. You are correct that disasters don't prove climate change but climate scientists don't make that claim. Prrof of climate change is more comprehensive than just looking at brush fires and is primarily focused on the relationship between CO2 and rising global temperatures. The science behind this is well established and agreed upon amongst the climate science community.
This is because extreme weather events and disasters are becoming quantifiably worse and more frequent 
"That's odd because everything I have read says that this is definitely not the case. Have you any proof for this claim, or is it the typical bullshit we read here all the time?"
"You have the same amount of data that they do. Do you have any data showing as you claim, that natural disasters are not at an all time high?"
It is the responsibility of the person making the claim to back it up.
"It is! And you made a claim directly after theirs, stating that it is false...and under your logic, you made a claim, so therefor you need proof to back up said claim."
Read from places that aren't fucking stupid then.
"They are not stupid, just deliberately misleading."

"No it isn't. It's because his party is responsible for cutting funds to organizations that prevent bush fires, and because he took an entire month to start committing any serious resources to fight the fires."
"""According to articles I've seen on reddit"" you mean like the ones posted to this dump of a sub?"
You are free to leave. You'll be happier.
It would be a disservice to the planet to let <em>climate deniers</em> talk garbage amongst themselves without an informed counterpoint.
According to the articles I've seen on Reddit.
"Bushfires alone do not prove climate change, they're just one result of it"
"Australia bushfires have become the issue they are because of climate change. They burn longer, harder, and more often."
Australia right wing and climate morons want to claim this isnt because of climate change because then they might have to acknowledge their policies are bad for humanity. In Australia that means reducing the massive industry of coal mining.
You make this claim with the certainty of a zealot...
"To be <strong><em>very</em></strong> clear, I am not denying climate change. It is 100% real. Let there be zero confusion over my stance on that."
"But to suggest, so clearly, that climate change is the obvious and only reason these fires are getting worse is ridiculously over-simplified and completely unproven."
I absolutely believe that climate change is playing a part in the increase in severity of these types of events...The evidence suggests that it is contributing...
"I also, however, believe that our (man's) behaviors as it relates to prevention of these events is contributing, and may well be contributing significantly more than climate change is, to this problem. <strong>Even MORE</strong> evidence suggests this is a major problem."
"The fact of the matter is, that as time has gone by, man has both mis-used much of this land, as well as sought to prevent fires like these, especially in areas like California and Australia...  But we tend to be short-sighted..."
"Due both to usage of the land without foresight, and in making efforts to curtail smaller, more controlled fires, as naturally happen in areas like those mentioned, we are quite possibly disturbing a natural process, averting the small fires which are more easily contained and less damaging, and inadvertently creating the right scenario for much larger-scale, more devastating fires to occur..."
"As we prevent the aforementioned smaller, more contained fires, we only allow nature to build up more caches of dead, rotting, drying plant material, which would otherwise be consumed in the smaller events... Once those caches become large enough, they end up in fires that rage beyond our ability to easily control them, resulting in the massive, devastating fires that we have seen recently..."
"Is climate change contributing to this as well? It seems very likely, yes...  Warming/drying climates will lead to even more drying/rotting dead plant material, ripe for such fires... I'm not sure, however, that our meddling with natural processes without properly understanding the consequences isn't the bigger culprit here..."
"But hey, I don't subscribe to the religion that is climate-alarmism, so I'm not trying to sell something like you appear to be. I'm just looking at the science, and what is actually happening, and trying to figure out why it's happening."
Try looking at the evidence and working forward from there to move toward a hypothesis and eventual solution. Starting with the conclusion and working backward to meet your religion's doctrine isn't science.
Australia has been having a problem with zealots from the left wing for a long time considering our right to bear arms was taken away by referendum.
I am sorry for this. :( That is a tragedy.
Natural rights should not be subject to popular vote.
"I wasn't even born at the time. I've never had rhose rights, just the aftermath where our Government has taken more and more without the gun to its head it used to have."
I suppose that's a matter of perspective.
"From my angle, you've <strong><em>always</em></strong> had those rights... you never lost them. A vote cannot take away a natural right."
"That said, practically speaking, I completely understand your frustration with your ability to exercise that right, due to the compulsion of your fellow man. And realize what it would mean for you to realistically ""regain"" that legal right, either by a lengthy political conflict, or -let us hope not-, a non-political conflict..."
I'm planning on moving to the states. Australia is too far gone due to our mainstream media picking up and publicly announcing whenever a pro firearms politician tries to adjust the law so its not as bad over time. There has been some progress. But nowhere near enough as the voting system highly favours the cities here.
"But to suggest, so clearly, that climate change is the obvious and only reason these fires are getting worse is ridiculously over-simplified and completely unproven."
Except they never said climate change was the only reason for that. But don't let that stop you from circlejerking about how they're a zealot.
"If I was reading Mist's comments here in a vacuum, I might agree with you."
"But it's quite clear from reading a few other of his posts in this thread that he does not appear to acknowledge any other contributing causes for the severity and frequency of these fires, and that smacks of his desperation in wanting to pin the cause on a single source."
"Again, sounds like religious zealotry. Ignore absolutely everything except that which supports your dogma. Even <em>considering</em> anything else outside of ""the truth"" only distracts and is heresy."
Yeah you're really reaching. The fact that they haven't mentioned other causes in their comments doesn't mean that they are a zealot who ignores everything except that which supports their claim. It's funny how you seem to want to take such a nuanced approach to the fires but then jump to labeling people as zealots based on not much.
"You think it's just a coincidence, then, that he only and repeatedly mentioned just one specific contributor to a multivariate problem, huh?"
"I don't mean this as an offense, but I find that to be pretty naive."
He makes the claim with the certainty of scientific fact.
"If scientific fact were his main concern, he would not leave factors of a multivariate problem, especially significant ones, unmentioned."
"They burn longer, harder, and more often."
"longer and harder can also be due to poor land management practices, including.....overzealous fire suppression.  After a few decades of putting out every single fire possible, the fuel load builds up to dangerous levels and when THAT catches on fire, BLAMO!"
See also the US - especially California.
"AGW is real, and should be taken seriously.  But it isn't going to be the pretense for total government takeover that the left would like it to be."
"You are scary, bro. The solution has to be something other than dismantling the entire energy sector in your country. Plus, your solution would not retroactively fix whatever damage has been done. I think the majority of people believe in climate change, the disagreement is in how it should be addressed."
Okay you say that but that doesnt explain the science. Its hotter so brush is more likely to burn? Are they arent getting as much water? Like what's the thought process behind that statement.
"Climate Change isn’t necessarily starting these natural disasters, but making it more severe and frequent."
"<a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2912/satellite-data-record-shows-climate-changes-impact-on-fires/"">https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2912/satellite-data-record-shows-climate-changes-impact-on-fires/</a>"
Correct. Warmer and dryer.
"High temps are an issue, but rapid shifts cause high winds as well. Combine that with climate change in Australia causing a 3 year draught and you get fires that spread like, well, wildfire across the plains."
"Note that this is a normal cycle feature of Australia, Indian Ocean dipole, but its been going on longer then normal. Its also not expected to end soon."
What really hurts however is that the ground has dried out in a normally unnatural way and created a 40 year high fire risk zone.
"<a href=""/u/denebius2000"" rel=""nofollow"">u/denebius2000</a> seemed to have the correct answer here"
"One major contributor, from what I've read, is that plants there (especially eucalyptus) actually evolved to require fire in their life cycle, such that their biology promotes wild fires."
"Probably less about <em>enjoying</em> fire though, than learning to tolerate it as an inevitability like some kind of masochistic defense mechanism. Eucalyptus oil is quite flammable, and its bark will peel off and float away during a fire and help it spread."
"Religion, mostly. I touched on this above, but both that post, and this one, are likely to get a response from Mist in line with someone who is having their dogma threatened."
"Changing climate is almost certainly contributing to these fires... So are other factors, which are likely significantly more important, but those factors are not part of his religion, so they will be doubtlessly mocked and derided in response to a post like mine, here. /shrug"
"Climate change has a little to do with the fires as everyone else is pointing out. But the bigger issue with the current fires is that the departments responsible for managing these fires were gutted by the current administration. There were plans to buy a fleet of waterbombing aircraft, carry out controlled burns and to staff Rural Fire Services, instead our current government spent that money on coal subsidies."
You sure it wasn't due to the HUNDREDS of people caught starting the fires? I mean 200 is only the number of people who the police CAUGHT lighting them...
"A shift in water tables and long swaths of time without rain will mean drier conditions. Record heatwaves further exacerbate drier conditions. Hot+dry vegetation+no rain+flame=fire. A lot of wildfires are man made, climate change merely exacerbates what happens after idiot sets wildland on fire."
"As an experiment, try lighting a tree on fire in the rainy season in early spring in the northeast."
This is still not evidence global warming isnt an issue.
#unfalsifiable
Are you trolling?
Check the byline.
Paul Joseph Watson is not a reliable source.

"Wait, that's a problem?!"
Because the government failed to do so for the last year's.
Every summer there are some arsonists that start some of the Bush fires. It's just something that happens
Because nature wasn’t. There are tons of videos of people doing that all over. Australia got it bad cuz their climate is always a fire hazard. People do it in the US too.
Being Australian myself this article is very ill-informed and incredibly sensationalist. 
"Small spot fires start all the time due to power line faults, Lightning strikes and human error. They are usually dealt with pretty quickly. To claim climate change isn't the result of how fast the flames grew to becoming uncontrollable is out right silly."
Not sure why this is libertarian related but ok
Because half of Libertarians seem to think climate change is a hoax and this... I guess confirms their views? (according to them)
Any sane person can see that pulling shit out of the ground and setting it on fire has to have some detrimental effect on the earth. 
I’m skeptical about using it to increase government power over the lower class while the rich can pay around any restrictions created.
Any sane person
"You're posting on <a href=""/r/libertarian"">/r/libertarian</a>."
Half of libertarians are retarded
You are being too kind.
That's a criticism i get sometimes actually
Because this event will likely be used to drastically increase the size and scope of government.
Because it proves once and for all that global warming a hoax and so government regulation of polluters is not necessary /s
edit:  apparantly needed to add the /s?
"Poe's law would indicate that yes, you do need the /s."
Caveman invent fire ipso facto libtards btfo?
"EDIT: I could tell, the ""once and for all"" gave it away."
Fuckin no?
This is just a news posting sub now.
how do you guys find these shitty sites?
"this ""article"" was literally written by a youtuber"
The website's owned by the former editor of infowars
Infowars is the biggest fucking joke of a website ever. If they reported the sky was blue I'd have to check again.
here's a more reliable source that backs up the statistics Watson has.
"<a href=""https://www.smh.com.au/national/arson-mischief-and-recklessness-87-per-cent-of-fires-are-man-made-20191117-p53bcl.html"">https://www.smh.com.au/national/arson-mischief-and-recklessness-87-per-cent-of-fires-are-man-made-20191117-p53bcl.html</a>"
"From November?  And even if it were relevant, that doesn't say shit about the impact of climate change on them."
"I think its relevant but regardless not everything has to talk about climate change, yes a hotter climate makes fires worse since oxidation is an exothermic reaction. But the climate isn't so hot that dry wood is spontaneously combusting."
"One thing Ill say is some eucalyptus trees (three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalyptus forests) evolved to reproduce only when fire cracks the hard shell of the seed, the aboriginals maintained the land with fire before we arrived and maybe that's how the land should be maintained now."
The hotter climate makes it worse because there is less rainfall and makes the areas drier. We are in a drought.....it's not because things are spontaneously combusting.
???????????
"Climate change isn't just ""climate hottening"" and that's it.  The amount that we have warmed the earth is really pretty small at this point.  You'd never notice 1 or 2 degrees in and of itself.  The real issue is that barely balanced weather systems in certain places may tip, and new patterns emerge.  You could end up with a wetter climate here, or a dryer climate there or any number of unexpected results.  If the changes are significant enough, local ecologies could collapse.  "
some eucalyptus trees (three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalyptus forests) evolved to reproduce only when fire cracks the hard shell of the seed
"That is the situation all over the world - though Australia has a notably large number of pyrophytic plants.  California's forests are badly managed, in the same way, with similar results."
True its not just climate hottening. From my point of view experiencing the current Australian summer it feels like it

The main contributor used to work for info wars. Excellent.
They could be trying to start a controlled back burn to try and limit the range of the larger wild fire. There r ways and situations where it makes sense to start a controlled burn next to a wild fire. It's done a lot in Idaho where I live to try and control the spread of large fires during the summer
Edit: I'm no forestry expert and don't claim to be just speaking of personal experiences. I do not know the whole story of y those people got arrested for starting fires.
It's done a lot in Idaho where I live to try and control the spread of large fires during the summer
just wait until your california refugees get numerous enough to put a stop to it.
"ranchers on the great plains have been burning FOREVER, because it's smart land management.  It benefits wildlife as well as livestock, and it crushes tics."
"now we have retirees and transplants showing up who get outraged over 'greedy destruction for profit' or having to reschedule their bbq's or soccer games due to the smoke, and want the state/feds to shut the burns down."
"After the horrible fires a decade ago they set high targets for controlled burnings, like 360.000 hectares a year. "
2018 it was below 100k and last year even less iirc.
"This was to prevent the build up of fuel load, not to fight ongoing fires. "
Who knows why the fires have so much material to burn now...
"And if you had listened to what current and former firefighters have been saying.....for over a year now....you would understand that because of the drought, and because of the extended fire seasons, the window to do things like hazard reduction have been shrinking every year. And also, burning quotas doesn't really mean that much either, which was another evaluation in the last decade, because it puts a number in place of any strategic considerations."
It's too intense to do that here mate I'm a firefighter in with the CFA Victoria and we only have a few weeks window where back burning is safe and effective and that window shortens every year
#justiceforJack
He was a good man from what I heard
"Attempting a controlled burn in these conditions without guidance from professionals deserves some form of punishment. Even is someone were to set their own land on fire to prevent more severe damage, the risk to surrounding property cannot be accepted."
"Edit: under the right conditions, go crazy if you have enough land. But doing this with the heat/wind/dryness is negligent."
"I'm neither a fire nor tree expert, but if everyone in the path of the blaze ran out and set a fire on the outskirts of their house, wouldn't that then save them the actual inferno? Assuming that their structures are far enough away to survive a fire 1 tree deep.  "
Although I guess you'd have a mile wide radius of bush burning around you before the first trees were spent.
So think of it this way. If you burn a line in the grass in front of a spreading fire it's not going to burn again most likely... If that makes sense
What do these numbers mean and when do they start? 
Are there people being arrested landowners lighting prescribed burns?
How many were malicious?
I could easily see Australian authorities arresting someone trying to clear the dry brush so their property doesn't burn down.
"Not impossible, a lot of folk out in the bush have patches of land the size of a European country. Still, backburning in this environment is risky. If you aren't working in real close co-operation with the fire services you could do more harm than good."
I believe that. Looks like it's a tinder box from the pictures.
"I met some Australians while camping in Yosemite a few years back, and they said some parts of Australia are so dry there is a complete ban on any source of fire going back over a decade. Communities can't have outdoor BBQs in your own backyard, or you can't use propane stoves while camping. They said it's a lot of cold or canned meals for them while camping."
"Ish, that's half the fun of camping. We're getting some of that in the Southwest states. I've got family in Arizona that had similar restrictions and in some instances banned smoking outside. 
Really too bad. It's hard to corral that many people."

"<a href=""https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/summit-news/"">What a shocker.</a>"
"Thanks for the link to the original article. I was thinking that the website was a less than credible source.   That being said, I doubt that we will see this in the US media. By this I mean the number of arrests for arson."
"Few cases were covered, it's just old news. The story is from December 20, 2019; god knows what the dates on the arrests are. The only one that was sourced was from November 14, 2019."
Can´t believe people still denying climate change.
"For the ones complaining about how people that talks about this never provide scientific evidence (idk about yall but If I care to know about something I actually go search that up myself instead of waiting for someone to hand me all the answers), here's some interesting stuff."
​
Here´s a study from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - US) to establish if the warming of the 20th century was caused by natural forcings or human-caused ones:

"Any ""news"" story that quotes Alex Jones is completely invalid."
"Not quoting isn't it, just advertising. At least looks like that to me."
The article quotes him.
Sorry I just don't see it.
"You’re right, it’s just an ad in the beginning of the article."
Exactly. Was wondering where the quote was but no worries😎
"Oh, I’m not the other guy, just affirming you are correct."
Oh shit I need to start looking at names:D
"Not sure if the article mentioned it, or if I skimmed over it, but how many people are normally arrested for this in a given year?"
Oh dude we had a few days were the media was publicising catastrophic fire conditions - basically if a fire starts you’re fucked.. not enough fire fighters and conditions will just fuel it... be ready to bug out
It’s an invitation for bell ends -  a few fires were lit in the city for instance.
The country is literally a tinder box at the moment -
After seeing how the leader of Australia was trying to get pictures for pr instead of listening or doing anything the tinfoil hat part of me is thinking they are just blaming people and acting like the government is here to save the day. Or climate change fucks trying to push an agenda.
"Last one. Australia has a massive industry at odds with climate change, just like America. Specifically Coal mining. "
"Add in that even the left wing of Australia is anti nuclear, and you get insanity."
They are China's bitch and their economy is dependent on mineral exports to China.
What the fuck kind of libertarian posts this shit? How can you profess to be committed to rationality and still believe climate change denier bullshit?
Do you think arson shouldn't be a crime?
Really didn't realize there were some many idiotic degens down under
Starting fires violates NAP m'kay.
I guess they took the phrase “fight fire with fire” too far
Oof
Oof indeed
That's a special kind of stupid.
What
Sounds like some jussie shenanigans
The concerning issue is the fire behavior due to climate change. Not how the fires started.
Park police should do their job
Which rights are being trampled here?
"Are your rights trampled if someone you want to date says that she doesn't date smokers and you smoke? If not, why is an employer any different? Do they not have freedom of association? What if you don't want to work for a company because the owner is a smoker; are you trampling his rights by refusing to be hired?"
It's a company dictating what their employees can and can't do with their free time. What freedom doesn't that violate? It's an invasion of privacy at the very least.
It's a company dictating what their employees can and can't do with their free time. 
It's some people deciding whether or not to associate with the kind of people who engage in behaviors they don't want to be associated with. The fact that these people form a company and associate with others by trading labor for money does not change their right to associate. 
"It's an invasion of privacy if the company forces anyone to divulge their behaviors. If you don't want them to know, don't tell them. Having been a smoker for 13 years, I can tell you that it's time consuming, even while at work."
Did you watch the video? That's exactly what they are doing.
"No, it's a company refusing to do business with someone. If you don't want to follow their rules, don't work there."
If I said the same about a goverment you would flip your shit. 
"Don't like what the goverment is doing, move."
"Don't like what the government is doing, move."
UHaul doesn't claim jurisdiction over my property and life. Government does. UHaul can't put employees in cages for smoking a cigarette in violation of their policy. Government can. UHaul can't see the paycheck of employees who violate their policies. Government can. And so on.
"No, they just have authority over 30,000 employees. I guess you only care when violations of rights affect you."
"Retarded post. They can fire whoever the fuck they want, period."
Well you clearly didn't watch the video.
You've been commenting that everywhere when I think you're the one that didn't watch it lol
"Yeah, because apparently no one watched it. Can you even tell me what it's about?"
no
Did you watch the video?
If you don't like their conditions then don't work for them.
If you don't like the government's intrusions you're just shit out of luck. 
The employer has the same right of association as anyone else. 
Which brings us back to 'no'.
If you don't like the government's intrusions you could just move. 
What a lazy answer.
"Maybe you should go back to the middle of the 20th century and let all those under communist regimes know they can just move if they don't like their government, see how that goes for you."
"If you don't like a company, you don't shop or work for them, it's as simple as that, no one can stop you."
"If you don't like your government, and you're lucky, then you can jump through several thousand hoops, fill out several trees worth of paperwork, HOPE another country will allow you to move there permanently, and then wait X amount of years until you have the same rights as your neighbors in your new country. Or, if you're not lucky, you get shot."
"Haha, what blows me away is that if this was a government decision people like you would be howling about how it violated personal freedoms."
Sure. But it's not
"Haha, whoosh"
You don’t understand how “whoosh” works. Lol
It's the sounds of all this going over your head.
"The government didn't create land, they have no right to it. Business owners on the other hand create their businiesses. There is a fixed amount of land, but not businiesses."
"Haha, land? What the hell are you talking about? This is about a massive invasion of privacy. Did you even watch the video?"
Talking about lazy answers...
"Watch the video, stay on topic or leave. I'm not going to entertain flights of fancy people like you get up to."
"Ok I will spoon feed you. You compared changing the business you work for with moving to another country. As I pointed out it is not a valid comparison because the amount of unimproved land is fixed but not the amount of businesses. You can't simply create more land like you can create another business. A business is created by its owner, so he has a rightful claim to it. The government didn't create land, so it doesn't have a rightful claim to it. You are using a false equivalence."
"No, it's a apt comparisons when responding to you utterly lazy talking point. It's not really shocking that your responce was so brain dead. It reflects you quite well."
Maybe you can and maybe you can't. 
When the government uses force often you can't. 
When you don't like your employer you can just not show up for work. They're not going to come drag you in.
When they don't like you they fire you and you both go your separate ways. 
You do not have the right to force an association with someone else. The economic exchange of employment is a mutual relationship.
This is a private business trampling on people's. You being lazy about your answers doesn't change that.
This is two private parties failing to come to a mutual agreement for an economic exchange. 
"I assume you think your ex is violating your right to bang him/her just because you broke up, too?"
Go stamp you feet harder about how your desires create an obligation on someone else.
Good answer mate
"So when these sorts of policies are adopted do you believe that they increase your freedom and opportunities, or do they limit them?"
Neither. 
It is just two parties deciding not to engage in an economic exchange. 
"If you don't like their terms, then don't accept them."
Make your own decisions and live with the consequences. 
This is no different than the people who decided not to eat at Chik-Fil-A over the issue of their donations. Do those people limit Chik-Fil-A's freedom of speech? Of course not.
Do you not see any difference between purchase and employment relationships?
No company can force a transaction so no
Did you watch the video?
I'm sure company towns don't count for some reason.
As a business owner I absolutely have the right to control what chemicals and odors come into my place of business.
"Really? If I open up a meat rendering plant next to your place of business, what right allows you too control the smell from my business? The fact that it goes outside and affects yours is the same cost and pollution externalizations that are the basis of capitalism."
"If it's to the point that I've suffered losses and can prove it's due to your negligence, then I can sue for damages"
"that isn’t controlling the odors coming in, that’s obtaining damages after the fact, which also refuted the point of OP."
[deleted]
What are you a fucking idiot? They said they can control smells in their business. I demonstrated they can’t.
[deleted]
Why are you yelling?
You don't have the right to control your employees when they aren't at work. Just because they work for you doesn't mean you get to control their lives.
Which is what this video is about.
Can't you still buy the VGA or whatever and the flavors separate and make your own juices?
The point of the video is that a company is dictating what people are doing off the job.
freedom of association is a pretty basic tenet of libertarianism.  Your attempts at trolling don't really change that.
People here <em>want to repeal the Civil Rights Act</em>.  You think they give a fuck about the rights of vapists?
"So no, you still haven't watched the video..."
"you can still buy juice, period.  The only thing that was banned was pre-filled cartridges."
For once I can say this without even being ironic:
What the fuck does this have to do with Libertarianism
Tax payers will be supporting this Child. Hunter is the biggest Welfare leech ever.
you might be retarded
Who fucking cares
Trumpets. Also Bernie Sanders fans like DSA.
Anything to distract and discourage from a democratic frontrunner.
Right?
To be fair tho. You and your idiot crew have Trump derangement syndrome and post non libertarian posts all day. 
This is just as silly for this sub as those posts.
"this has nothing to do with <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/libertarian</a> "
fake troll.  Go back to the_donald.
I didn't know DC had a stripper child.
"Biden met Lunden Roberts, 28, while she worked as a stripper in Washington, D.C."
"Biden at the time was dating Halle Biden, 45"
"Biden is expecting his fifth child with his new wife, Melissa Cohen Bide, 32"
"He has three grown children with former wife, Kathleen Buhle."
This guy gets around.
"This solidified my vote for MR. TRUMP. Gods chosen vessel, and the champion of TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES."
I was told there was no sex in the champagne room.  I guess exceptions can be made.
It’s funny when you realize that someone’s political views usually does not make them a better/worse person.
I honestly don't know or particularly care what Hunter Biden's political views are.
Yeah but you’ll sit here and shit on Trump for asking Ukraine how the hell he got a 50k a month
"Trump is a politician. Hunter, not so much."
Oh right so I forgot that meant a crack head low life was qualified for a job his father got him.... because of politics.... great reasoning! No flawed logic there! 
So yes you should care about his “politics” and how they line up with that of your own views. You really think it’s acceptable for him to have that job “representing” America? Lololol
Dude? Jarred and Ivanka ? The pot calling the kettle black ...amazing . At least  Hunter didnt get any official position and didn't have an impact on any policy . And most importantly wasn't paid by taxpayers .
"You do know Ivanka and Jarred take no salary, so yeah no tax payer dollars there. And what makes them unqualified? I guess I’m confused why Trump couldn’t chose them to do a job (which they’ve fulfilled) and neither one has been known to use crack, fuck their dead brothers wife and then steal their dead brothers name to check into rehab! So weird!!! Yeah wow Omgosh you enlightened how ridiculous it is to compare the Trump kids to Hunter Biden"
Jahred Kushner ... real estate investor becomes senior adviser to the persident ... i m sure he s very qualified (only the best) .
"Ivanka Trump...well i got a interresting read for you
Business"
"Trump briefly worked for Forest City Enterprises as a real estate project manager.[24] In 2005, she joined the family business as Executive Vice President of Development &amp; Acquisitions at the Trump Organization.[25]"
"In 2007, she formed a partnership with Dynamic Diamond Corp., the company of diamond vendor Moshe Lax, to create Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, a line of diamond and gold jewelry sold at her first flagship retail store in Manhattan.[26][27] In November 2011, her retail flagship moved from Madison Avenue to 109 Mercer Street, a larger space in the fashionable SoHo district.[28][29]"
"In December 2012, members of 100 Women in Hedge Funds elected Ivanka Trump to their board.[30]"
"On October 2, 2015, it was reported that ""Ivanka Trump's flagship store on Mercer Street appear[s] to be closed"" and, noting that the shop had been ""stripped clean"".[31] In October 2016, the only dedicated retail shop and flagship boutique for Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry was located at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, with her brand also being available at Hudson's Bay and fine-jewelry stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.[32]"
"She also had her own line of Ivanka Trump fashion items, including clothes, handbags, shoes, and accessories, available in major U.S. and Canadian department stores including Macy's and Hudson's Bay.[33] Her brand was criticized for allegedly copying designs by other designers,[34][35] and by PETA and other animal rights activists for using fur from rabbits.[36][37] In 2016, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled Ivanka Trump-branded scarves because they did not meet federal flammability standards.[38][39] A 2016 analysis found that most of the fashion line was produced outside the U.S.[40] Ivanka Trump-brand shoes have been supplied by Chengdu Kameido Shoes in Sichuan and Hangzhou HS Fashion (via G-III Apparel Group) in Zhejiang."
"On February 2, 2017, after months of customers boycotting and poor sales,[42] department store chains Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom dropped Trump's fashion line, citing ""poor performance."""
"On February 9, 2017, presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway controversially encouraged Fox News viewers to purchase Trump's retail products.[44] In June 2017, three people with the organization called China Labor Watch were arrested by Chinese authorities while investigating Huajian International, which makes shoes for several American brands, including Ivanka Trump's brand. The Trump Administration called for their release."
"On July 24, 2018, Trump announced that she shut down her company after deciding to pursue a career in public policy instead of returning to her fashion business."
"And she s also a senior advisor ...but hey i m sure daddy isnt the reason she was granted 5 trademarks by China amidst the trade talks . I guess it s ok because ""they dont get paid"" ."
Oh right so I forgot that meant a crack head low life was qualified for a job his father got him
His father secured a job he wasnt qualified for? Sounds like Trump.
Exactly the same as the Trumps. Jared and Ivanka as personal advisors to the president? Jared responsible for Middle East peace? DJT Jr.’s mistress serving on Trump’s re-election campaign? RNC buying $100K of Trump’s son’s new book?
"here is the problem with your lame trolling.  It is not even remotely reasonable.  No person on earth has that viewpoint,  it is impossible. "
The only thing your posts are good for is a cure for insomnia.
"Literally, your dumb ass is gonna say no one has that viewpoint yet Trump is in office and will win again in 2020.... it’s almost like you watch CNN and MSNBC and they tell you that “no reasonable person thinks like that”.... meanwhile they have been so fucking wrong for FOUR years that they lost millions of viewers? Please tell me no reasonable person thinks that way and I’ll refer you to an electoral map from 2020 where it LITERALLY shows you 29 of 21 states actually think that way!!! Crazy, I know man!!! Fricken BONKERS crazy. Hold onto those tissues cause you got 4 more years of hating your life and waking up miserable each day"
will win again in 2020.
"oh hey,  look at the fake troll using his fantasy as proof."
"You are in the wrong subreddit, sir.   no one falls for your fake nonsense."
Yeah I wonder why what Trump does matters....
Maybe...
He's the President?
Donald Trump?  President of the United States?  That seems highly improbable.
Who is the Vice President? Gary Busey??
No because again... I don't particularly care about what Hunter Biden does with his life.
What's the summary of that? It's over an hour long...
"And its  worth every second. Pretty reflected report on how the authoritarian chinese government starts buying up essential seaports all over the asian and african continent, how it grows its circle on influence drastically by means of financial influence and how Trumps policy against China does the exact opposite of what it is intended to do. (Talking about the trade tariffs and so on). Resulting basically in a diminishing importance of freedom in the world. Just watch it, I can really recommend to take that time."
"To be perfectly honest, I posted this because I love the title so fucking much.  But it's a great piece as well that really highlights the servile and authoritarian-worshiping nature of trump supporters."
Here's Dobb's exact quote:
"""It is a shame that this country which is benefiting so much from this president's leadership does not understand their obligations to this leader who is making it possible"""
The author of the piece makes an excellent response:
"The nation has ""obligations to The Leader."" Jesus Christ, man. Really saying the quiet part out loud."
"In a constitutional republic, the people have no obligation to any politician, not even the president. He works for us. We give him the job and pay his salary. It is our duty as a self-governing people to monitor what he does and make our own decisions as to whether that policy is in our personal interests and the collective national interest."
Obligation to the leader? Sounds more like an authoritarian regime than a democratically elected government when he puts it like that. Though redcap lackeys do tend to treat him as the second coming of Christ.
Lol @ this being downvoted
They're obligated to the leader to downvote
I always thought leaders had obligations to their constituents. Did I miss something?
Personality cult 101. Listen and believe your leader.
"No offense, Lou Dobbs, but that sounds like some fucking commie gobbledygook."
It is neither a contract nor very social to try to control others through aggression.
it's also not very social if you break the law.
"Which ""the law"" do you mean? Is it anti-social to smoke marijuana when it's against ""the law"" to do so? Why do some people get to decide that's not social and others don't have a say?"
because only one side can win.
there is plenty of compromise when it comes to drug use. do it at home: who gives a fuck.
"you want to campaign for it, that's perfectly legal."
"police only concern themselves with distribution and problem cohorts, because they are trying to get something done."
"Do you have an example of a policy you dislike, that others have justified with social contract theory?"
voluntary individual freedom
i think you would have to come up with a plan on how to deal with murder and mayhem.
Ok if it threatens my life or my property it is wrong and not beneficial to society. That's not really hard to understand we don't need some complex system to get that message across.
"if you enforce the NAP, then you have a social contract though."
I thinking of the John Locke socal contact on why we need a government.
An Iranian general managed a group of Saudis (Iran's arch enemy) for 9/11?
"It's genious! Be right back, I think my landlord was also involved in 9/11"
Is this how the communist revolution happens?
All the communists were involved in 9/11 too.
Communists and land-lords gone? wtf I like drone strikes now.
Until we find out that you were 9/11 all along
"First, they came for the Iranian generals, and I did not speak out—"
Because I was not an Iranian General. ...
"Rumor had that he also kicked a puppy, parked in a handicap spot, and frequently would get pineapple on his pizza."
Anyone that gets pineapples on pizza needs a drone strike.
"Listen here fuck stick, pineapple on pizza is a viable pizza option and I'll not have you tarnish it! Our Lord and savior Ron Paul says so. I seent it!"
i bomb you.
DO NOT FRUIT THE PIZZA!
Pineapples and pizza is the perfect mix of sweet and savory and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

Soleimani met with American intelligence after 9/11 to help them identify Taliban targets.
"You know, the Taliban. The terrorist group that shielded Osama bin Laden and which thinks that Iranians with their Shia Islam are heretics. That Taliban. The one that collaborated with Al Qaeda, the terrorist group that committed the 9/11 attacks that also, you know, hates Shia Islam and wants to destroy the Iranian government. That Al Qaeda."
"Yeah, Soleimani totally helped them commit 9/11."
Goddamn idiots.
Yup. There was a time not too long ago where we coordinated military operations against ISIL
"It's easy to make people believe that Shia and Sunni and all other denominations of Islam are allied with each other, even including that wacky cult that thinks Mohammed came from outer space. All the same thing, right?"
"Now, try calling an evangelical a Catholic..."

Clearly he was just trying to throw us off his trail.
Why would this admin lie? And we know they never have lied before.
"lmao,  the party of lies makes more lies."
"the bigger and stupider they are,  the more the statist loving republicans gobble it up."
The Embassy attack would have been enough justification (for most)  this just throws out any credibility they had left.
They have Congressional approval to strike 911 related enemies.  But they do have to prove it to Congress and/or the judiciary.
So far it feels like that are asking lawyers what they are allowed to do afterwards.
"What a fucking idiot , Saudis were involved and saudies and israel hates iran."
"Wow, Powell had a more compelling argument than this load of shit. Republicans sure aren't sending their best."
"Wow, the gas lighting by this administration is unreal."
"I know I’m older, and maybe my memory is foggy but I don’t recall Republicans ever saying Saddam was involved in 9/11.  Sure, I expect there’s some random person with an R on their voters registration who is stupid enough to say this, and while the Rs in congress are they’re own special kind of stupid, I have a hard time believing one would be this idiotic."
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_link_allegations"">In the lead up to the Iraq War, U.S. President George W. Bush alleged that Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda might conspire to launch terrorist attacks on the United States,[2] basing the administration's rationale for war, in part, on this allegation and others</a>"
I have a hard time believing one would be this idiotic.
This may have been a quote from me in 2016. I would no longer say this.
"Something like 70% of Americans believed Saddam was involved in the 9/11 attacks, and the government did basically nothing to disabuse them of this notion: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/07/usa.theobserver"">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/07/usa.theobserver</a>"
"Documents from the Bush White House had Donald Rumsfeld asking his staff if 9/11 was ""enough to hit Saddam Hussein."""
and the government did basically nothing to disabuse them of this notion
"The first line in the link you shared says, ""Seven in 10 Americans continue to believe that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had a role in the 11 September 2001 attacks, <strong>even though the Bush administration and congressional investigators say they have no evidence of this.</strong>"""
Bush administration definitely claimed the link between Iraq and al-Qaeda leading up to the Iraq war. It was only later uncovered later under scrutiny that they lacked the evidence.
"I mean, Vice President Cheney can be quoted all over the place saying it. In 2004 Cheney said there was overwhelming evidence on NPR linking the two."
"I said ""did basically nothing"" not ""did nothing."""
"They certainly could've tried harder, along with mass media..."
"It's like the idiot birthers. The official GOP stance was one of ""no comment"" or, if pressed, ""well he says he is so he must have been born here.""...but they did nothing to speak out against the loons."
I don't know that it's the role of either to convince Americans of anything.
"Hm, perhaps not, though many of them were guilty of lying by omission."
Who and how?
"Hello semantics, my old friend"
"The Iraq war was was definitely packaged as part of Bush's 'War on Terror', which he launched after 9/11."
They said there were weapons of mass destruction and that Saddam wanted to attack the United States but no real accusations that he was involved in 911. I guess we're rewriting history to give Congress a pass for authorizing a pointless war.
"I mean, saddam did have chemical weapons... and used... them... against umm... Iran."
You mean the ones we sold him?
"When you say “we”, I assume you mean Germany.  The chemical weapons facilities were built with German help.  German companies also helped him expand his nuclear weapon program. "
"Russia helped with nuclear, France sold uranium to Iraq. The British helped with mustard gas, and the U.S. funneled biological samples."
"Everyone said there were WMDs, every intelligence service across the globe.   Saddam put up a lot of bluster, and there’s part of me that figures he was attempting to keep the regional wolves at bay.   He was actively targeting American fighter jets who were enforcing the no-fly zone, which is a bit of a stretch but part of what I took to be the argument for his alleged desire for aggression against the U.S."
Google yellow cake. That's the name of the fake intelligence memo that Bush used as evidence of WMDs in Iraq.
"Many Republican politicians said this in the lead up to and during the Iraq War and Dick Cheney appeared in multiple interviews pushing that Saddam and Al Qaeda had operational ties, specifically mentioning terrorists who were involved with the 93 and 9/11 WTC attacks (this was later proven to be false). George W Bush connected Iraq with terrorism and Al Qaeda but weaseled around overtly stating 9/11 since the intelligence community did not support this theory  and he stated in his commencement of combat operations that "
"""I have also determined that the use of armed force against Iraq is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. """
The Bush Administration was so successful that in 2003 69% of the US believed Saddam was involved in the 9/11 attacks.
They <em>still</em> exploiting one of the saddest days of my life to sell this bullshit.
Still kicking that can down the road. I think 9/11 has lost it’s “good excuse” power by now.
I don't recall any substantial accusations that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11.
Yet most people believed our invasion of Iraq in 2003 was directly related to 9/11.
Most people dont care for history. And the history of the middle east is even more complicated so i dont see that changing any time soon
"The was a link between 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. 9/11 led to an ill-defined and broad 'War on Terror'. The invasion of Iraq was a continuation of that 'war'. Even though Saddam had nothing to do with the attacks, the propaganda had such a broadly defined enemy that Saddam was considered part of the same group of 'terrorists'"
you not remembering them doesn't mean they didn't happen.

No Robert muller lied about him having WMDs

if it was true trump would have done an Obama bi laden esque press conference
"I read the entire article. In the end, all I've read is we've wasted so much money investigating things happening overseas. In the end, who even knows what is true or not. I trust a government funded and ran investigation at the same level as I trust any government run operation. All I know is that we have zero business involving ourselves in any of it."
Good god did he really say that?
This article just shows pence saying in a tweet that he helped them travel to Afghanistan. Not that he was involved in the September 11 plot as the title suggests. That’s why people need to read articles. This article could’ve been titled “Pence was caught in the 69 position with lance bass” and people would’ve said omg pence is such a hypocrite.
So you mean it says exactly what's in the title and no one is buying it? Shocker.

He's probably referring to 2012 attack on our Embassy in Libya.
Then he can specify. I'm not going to give benefit of the doubt to the person who speak professionally and who is trying to justify assassinating a foreign general.

Why is this on R_libertarian?
"It's pretty funny how all of MAGAland pretended they were non-interventionist and anti-war until Donald Trump started war mongering (in a completely predictable flip for their minds since they have no morals), and now you can't post anti-war articles from a Libertarian magazine because it makes you a liberal to someone like you."
This.
"why are you on <a href=""/r/libertarian"">/r/libertarian</a>?"
"Presumably for the same reason it's featured in a monthly libertarian magazine, published by a libertarian think-tank."
That’s not answering the question. It sure seems like this sub is for liberals who want to pretend to be libertarians
"Just because we bash Republicans everynow and then doesnt make us democrats. And most of us here are ""classic"" liberals. So.... yes. We bash Republicans for doing dumb shit. If you only want to participate in the bashing democrats threads then I suggest you leave this one."
“Classic” liberals are not modern liberals by any stretch. And I am because this sub is not for libertarians
"So bashing a war monger is anti libertarian. Man were you texting during the whole ""how to be a libertarian"" welcome course."
"It's certainly not for you, Redcap"
Now fuck off with your lackey ass
You're mad that libertarian content on a libertarian sub isn't Republican enough for you?
Libertarianism isn’t inherently right or left wing though economically most tend to be right wing.
"But to answer your question, anti-interventionism and skepticism of the military industrial complex are principles held by many libertarians. In fact, one of the most popular libertarians to ever be in the public eye has a weekly show that mostly deals with this issue called the Ron Paul Liberty Report."
The argument from a right libertarian point of view makes sense especially when you consider how military spending is in direct opposition to fiscal conservatism.
"While not a libertarian, Donald Trump’s platform during his 2016 campaign was partially based on the fiscal conservative argument against military intervention. I only bring up that fact to highlight that being critical of our foreign policy isn’t just a liberal talking point."
Sure seems like facts hurt your republican feelings.
why aren't libertarians free to discuss American politics? Do American libertarians not live in this country? I never quite understand this line of thinking.

"Well, yes. If not being told what to do applies to being told what to do (being told to do what we want to do?), then yes, thats us."
"However, I was talking about identifying yourself with a certain entity or institution rather than a philosophy or way of thinking (at the end of the day no matter what you think, there is probably a group for that way of thinking) ."
"For example, you can love soccer, but associating yourself with a specific club makes you sometimes justify all their actions. Or you can be conservative and identify yourself to the republican party at the point where you protect Trump no matter what (Fox news), and same for dems."
Oh shit murdered by words

"Cool quote but not all war follows this philosophy, WW2 had people join the army because they saw our country attacked at pearl harbor and recognized that Hilter was a bad man. Same can be said after 9/11, I know many people that enlisted because they saw our country attacked."
From the point of view of the Germans in WW2 this quote applies.
Also this is 100% why WW1 happened which set the stage for WW2 to happen
And the wars they are denying happened this way. Even if the young people saw Hitler as evil even if they saw 9/11. The old people werent killing each other and the young were. It's all about exploiting the youngs lives to give up their lives for the cause. That's war. Always has been. Always will be. Even if you think its justified. That's what it is.
"<a href=""http://quaker.org/legacy/co/Writings/JustAndUnjustWar.htm"">Alternative take on WWII</a>"
Our country was attacked by Saudis on 9-11...not Afghanis or Iraqis.
Don't believe the spoon fed bullshit...
Our leaders were the ones misleading us about the real enemies. Those kids who signed up because they felt scared and wanted to do something to protect their country are blameless.
I suppose it doesn't fit perfectly under the quote but it's the same general idea: the rich using the poor for unjustifiable wars. It's just that in this day and age propaganda is way more important to convincing those poor masses the war is actually justifiable.
"Mr. Valentine and Mr. Male, two teachers of mine who were also Vietnam Vets, never had a good word to say about war and their experiences. Mr. Valentine had a bullet wound in his shoulder he would show to us inquisitive 4th graders, and Mr. Male said war was so rich men could grow ever more powerful. I remember at school during Gulf War 1.0 our school had the students salute the flag and sing the anthem, and Mr. Valentine turned his back to the flag pole. The military requires the blood and bodies of young men (and women) because most of them don't know any better, and were spoon fed bullshit from action movies that we are right and those other people are wrong. War is a racket."
"And, WWII was arguably the beginning of the modern racket...but, people insist on propagating the propaganda..."
Says the person quoting Howard Zinn lol
"In what world do you live in where Zinn would be considered ""spoon fed?"""
"If you are looking for a ""woke"" perspective of American History Zinn's reading is it.  We all search for validation of our own beliefs its ok."
"""So woke...,"" as opposed to an actual, substantive reply is so boringly reddit...carry on...anti-woke woker..."
Says the dude calling people names...GG
"That still doesn't address how, in comparison to OP, Zinn's perspective aligns with the spoon fed propaganda we all receive in US history. Zinn is, categorically, an alternative take on US participation in WWII."
"And, yeah...the modern MIC is rooted in US WWII efforts (ie selfish motivations)...so, there's that...condescending fuck."
"<a href=""https://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/"" rel=""nofollow"">If you believe you can dismiss Howard Zinn, a well respected and honored historian and author,</a> just out of hand, then you have serious integrity problems."

"Yeah, I think it’s kind of insulting to imply that the men and women in our military are ignorant of the reasons they’re risking their lives."
"The difference is we now know the government lied about Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and used lies and faulty reasoning to get us in meaningless wars"
But all wars since WW2 do. If WW3 started do to Trump's actions would you be still saying that?

"""Screw you guys. I'm going home."""
If only...
Make the leaders fair game and we'll see a lot fewer wars.
"Leaders don't die in wars anymore. The last major war that saw the deaths of very many major leaders was world War 1, since then our precious oligarchs have either found excuses for their kids or they've sent them on daycare patrols (like the British prince who served in Afghanistan with an entire Gurkha battalion as basically his personal guard)"
"True, but prince Harry didn't really have a personal guard, he flew Apaches... there ain't no gurkhas that can save you if you get hit by a rocket i think?"

"Being taught to hate actually is pretty easy per say, I was watching a video of pigs getting beat up inside a slaughter house and the pigs just weren't really walking in line the way the should've and I honestly couldn't help but think to myself, ""c'mon! Stupid pigs, if you just move a little faster. Then, this butcher and slaughter house workers wouldn't be yelling so loud and kicking you so hard.""
This example also translates to Nazi and Jew workers being mad and angry at their prisoners for being so slow and tired, depressing at the concentration camps. The thing is hate is a really extremely very easy emotion to channel into and that is what not only war, but violence in general amps up and leverages."

I don’t remember eric cartman saying that...
"My dad and I were complaining about recent developments and my brother said what may be the greatest piece of wisdom I've heard in a while. We are not just fighting an oldman's war, we are fighting a dead man's war."
Wars are awesome... not in real life though but they make for good videogames and movies
Trump kills the old general directly without using thousands of troops to do it. And the reaction here:
"OMG, Trump assassinated a State figure. How dare he!"
"LOL, pick one boys."
"The reaction here is that the assassination was either a deliberate attempt to start a war, or a clueless action from a bumbling idiot that could start a war accidentally. There's no contradiction here."
No.  The reaction was a punch in the face to a bully but not a gunshot or bomb.
Only an idiot would call this an assassination or an attempt to start a war (or a shill?).  Trump has been extremely measured in using our military.  
I have to say - this place is a shit show of people spewing kooky stuff out of their pieholes.  I feel like I am in worldnews or politics sometimes reading a few folks here.
Only an idiot would call this an assassination or an attempt to start a war (or a shill?).

If we bombed their embassy unprovoked first then I'd be willing to say it was an expected response. I feel like everyone is completely ignoring the giant hole in our embassy in Iraq.
This is an oversimplification made by inexperienced young people to connect with other inexperienced young people. To look at the world so black and white is to do the universe and its entropy a great disservice.

"You didn’t son, you ended all wars"
"I don't know man, after serving in Afghanistan I truly came to hate them. They are vile. Fucking goats and little boys, stoning women for showing their ankles... I watched a guy in full Hollister clothes pulling his donkey along, decided he needed to take a shit, dropped trou and shit right there in the street. Wiped his hand on his donkey and carried on.

"Still a choice. You can choose not to go. There are consequences either way. I'm not saying it's fair or right, but there are always options."
Reeee! Why are you siding with Iran?! They're EEEEVVVIIILLL!!!!
"Hi friend! Thanks for your post. I dont think you will find a single Libertarian that thinks Iran is a good country. (After all, it's not exactly libertarian friendly).  No one here likes Iran's government, their policies, or the people that tacitly and explicitly keep Iran's government in power."
"But not liking a country does not make war a good strategy for anyone. First, you vastly underestimate our ability to make things worse. Refugees, desperate retaliation on soft targets, attacks against civilians, and eventually abandoning anyone who helps us, are far more likely outcomes to Lebanon than Iran quietly going away.  "
"Second, we suck at it. Bombs cost us hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, and we use each one to destroy property worth far less.  Imagine if Apple lost $100k, every time you lost a dollar. Who wins that fight in the long run?"
"War or ""nothing"" are not the only options we have. Nor are they the only options for Lebanon. Good luck man."
I feel like this perfectly encapsulates my stance on the matter. Iran needs to go but that doesn't mean war is the only or right option
Iran needs to go
"What does that mean? Where does a country ""go""?"
"I mean that Iran as we know it needs to go. The Iranian government is pretty much just a terror state, being the largest government that sponsors terrorism both directly and indirectly. The people are largely fine, the government is practically the definition of evil"
being the largest government that sponsors terrorism both directly and indirectly

"What you cannot expect America to do is stick around afterwards long enough to fix things all the things that it has broken. This is a classic case of “be careful what you ask for, you might just get it”."
"Stick around, yes. Fix things, no."

"This is probably the best take I've seen from a ""libertarian"" in a long ass time"
"I feel like sanctions are a good alternative since war is so hopeless. We should sanction Iran and other authoritarian regimes for their human rights abuses and hopefully the people of those countries will start a revolution to overthrow their leaders and pursue freedom.
I don't see how this can be done without sanctions?"
"Eh. Sanctions didnt work with North Korea, Venezuela, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Hezbollah. I kind of doubt they would work now. Iran is going to get nukes unless Russia and China think that threatens their interests in some way."
"Sanctions have reduced the power and influence of the countries and organizations you've listed, its also sparked a revolution in Venezuela and protests in Iran over fuel prices which are steps in the right direction of removing authoritarian regimes."
Whats an alternative to sanctions to punish abuse by state powers?
"Ha, I am sorry, but I need to answer your question with a question. What do you want the outcome to be? You used the phrase ""punish Iran for abuses..."" which ones? If we just fine them every time they throw a gay dude off a roof, is that a desired outcome for you? I dont know that I can argue they have no right to nukes, and no right for their own citizens to want to live under a backwards theocracy. So I have no desire to ""punish"" them for that.  My goal be to stop Iran from funding the various groups that actually attack the property and people of America and its ally, Israel, but they could still do what they want in iraq, SA, and Syria.  If you want something different, my strategy is only geared toward that goal."
the outcome I want is for people to have more freedom. I think in retaliation to the protesters Iran killed and tortured we could apply sanctions to disincentivize that behavior.
"I dont know that I can argue they have no right to nukes, and no right for their own citizens to want to live under a backwards theocracy."
I cant disagree with that. I guess our political obligation is to help ally's but don't we have a moral obligation to help those protesting an oppressive regime?
"Absolutely not. How can we? Should we send in the military to help the occupy wall street protesters? Or to help the Vietnam war protesters? We would literally send in the troops to every country on earth, if that is what you seek. People have the right to live under immoral, evil governments, if that is what they choose to do. That's how we keep losing wars. We send troops in to rain down democracy on people who dont want it."
"That's why open borders are important. For the very small number of Iranians who actually share our values of life, liberty, and property rights, they should not be able to force the other 80 million Iranians to adopt those values. They should move to a western country, and join us. That's what makes this corner of the world special and worth fighting for, but we are out numbered by people who dont share those values."
"If you just want to go on adventures to help protesters, I have no ideas for you. I wish you the best of luck, but you only get volunteers. You cant order troops who signed up to protect Americans, to die for foreigners (in an adventure likely to fail, to boot.)"
"Sorry if I worded that poorly but I'm not talking about sending troops at all.
I'm saying that we should <strong>not</strong> have troops overseas and that we have a moral obligation to sanction authoritarian regimes that commit human rights abuses."
"Like you said your goal would be ""to stop Iran from funding the various groups that actually attack the property and people of America and its ally, Israel"" how would you achieve that without using sanctions?"
"Sorry, you did say sanctions. But my point stands. If you sanction the ""bad"" governments of the world, its America that loses. If we had to stop buying from Saudi, China, and most of south east Asia, we literally will have Argentina level inflation. We just cant produce goods and oil at prices that American consumers can afford."
"For my limited objective of stopping the iranians from funding terrorists groups, I would do more than sanctions. We have had Iran under sanctions since 1979. How many more decades before we decide that sanctions dont work?  70% of Irans money comes from selling oil to russia and china. Either we stop that dynamic, or we accept Iran funding terrorism...it really is that simple.  Luckily, of the 145 oil fields in Iran, more than half their production comes from only 5 fields. (Ahez, being their biggest)."
"I would publicly state that we cant accept Iran using oil money to fund terrorism, and give Russia and China a choice: they seize those fields from Iran, or we bomb those fields, and no one gets them."
"Russia benefits from high oil prices, so they won't care. China isn't particularly imperialist in the middle east, they may or may not seek a diplomatic solution with Iran. Either way, no one would take America seriously, so yes, we have to bomb those fields. Our fracking industry and green energy industries would benefit, and oil prices would likely more than double. But for minimal cost, we could disrupt 60% or so of Irans income for months. They would rack up debt restoring the fields, and buying air defenses and once they got the fields working again.... we would strike again. Eventually china and iran would feel actual pain. All Iran would have to do to stop the pain, is agree to not do something they already claim to not do."
We should sanction Iran and other authoritarian regimes for their human rights abuses
Except that any sanction policy on these grounds will invariably also sweep up countries we consider allies.
True but that's the point to deter any state from abusing their people. I don't think we should be ally's with Saudi and other questionable states
I don't think we should be ally's with Saudi and other questionable states
I agree.
Problem is the sanctions don't work as well anymore especially after the Iran Nuclear Deal fiasco. The Americans have been throwing them out like crazy that its effect is decreasing. Also Iran will likely get a nuclear weapon and then what. You have to take into account Trump actions has sped up many institutions and trade deals as well as infrastructure ahead to bypass the US. The Chinese and the Russians are trying to create a system that works sperate from SWIFT.
And Trump leaving the Nuclear deal also led to Europe finding ways to bypass sanctions.
True you really need ally's to be apart of sanctions for them to be most effective.
What's SWIFT?

"Problem is alot of these fights you see are surface and headline news, which ignore alot of the fighting that happens behind the scene."
"Yeah, the libertarian position is more or less isolationist; it isn't our job to solve anyone else's problems but our own, and it's none of our business besides."
"It isn't only that it's not our problem, it's that were incapable of solving it. The Middle East cannot be made peaceful through foreign invasion."
"I disagree.  A brutal dictator would tamp sectarian violence down in short order, which seems to be the theme in the ME."
"Granted, Westerners arent going to go Saddam 2.0 all over the region and crush it into compliance, but peace the barbaric way does seem to be possible.  Just not desireable."
Has that been scientifically proven yet? Or are the assholes in charge going to run some more experiments?
Still testing...
That's not necessarily true. It would be entirely ethical to help defend others. Just things don't usually work out that way.
"As an individual sure, but as a country? The US government has a duty to defend its citizens and sovereignty. Getting involved in a foreign conflict where there is no clear and present danger to the US falls outside of the job description in my opinion."
"How do we justify both the cost of American lives and taxpayer dollars, not to mention the unintended consequences mingling in the affairs of others may have down the road? I’m not sure you can just for the sake of helping others. If the American people want to donate to the cause or go over and fight that’s their prerogative, but I’m not sure it’s the role of the US government to do so."
"Unless there is a scenario where there is overwhelming support from citizens to go to someone’s aid, I just can’t find a justification as to why the government should do it."
Not just in your opion.  The constitution says this as well.
"This is a libertarian issue I have the hardest time accepting. To watch terrible people slaughter innocent people and doing nothing about it, because it's not our issue is a tough ideal to accept. "
"I know this is happening pretty much everywhere, and to exterminate every unjust tyrant is impossible. It's just hard to not try to help."
That being said. I would much prefer not to be the boots on the ground we send. I would be more than willing to help pay for it.
"More and more wars will be fought through economics and cyber.  We are and will continue to crush Iran economically without the need to waste US resources and lives.  The assassination was a strategic response to an attack on a civilian US facility in a “hostil” country where a lack of response can actually escalate things worse than a swift strategic response...  but, we can’t know the future.  I am personally against our involvement in the Middle East and policing the world in general.  Now that we’re over there and the situation is tense, it’s hard to know how to handle it."
The way we should help is to open our doors and say if you can make it here you are welcome. Unfortunately we have a giant welfare state that makes that all but impossible in reality.
"Is there a line to be drawn? If a country is using chemical warfare on its citizens, should the US intervene? Is it your opinion that the US has no business fighting Nazi Germany in WW2?"
"I mean, they declared war on us lol."
We supported and sent military aid to the Allies before that.  And Germany declaring war on us was more of a symbolic thing than anything.
You could a lot more easily argue that the Axis powers were a clear and serious threat to the sovereignty of the United States. Some rag tag militia half way across the world is not lol.
The world leading state sponsor of terrorism is not a threat?
"Nope, not really. They can’t exactly invade and take us over, not to mention the fact that terrorists target us because of our interventionism in the first place. They’d be even less of a threat if we just left them the fuck alone."
And we have so many problems of our own that our country doesn't do shit about.
"I don’t have an qualms with helping out other countries in crisis. However, while there still veterans who are homeless and suffering, we should not get into another one. We need to fix the plethora of problems we have domestically."
Volunteer fighters can buy their own ticket to lebanon.
Do you also apply the same logic inside your own country? I.e. I shouldn't have to fund police services for anyone but me.
Domestic policy and foreign policy are completely different topics.
Libertarian ideology says that borders are arbitrary.
"Arbitrary as in it doesn't make sense to try to enforce them with immigration policy, not that they don't exist. That would be more an anarchic opinion."
Individual rights exists regardless of borders. It is not more morally permissible to force me to fund a police force who enforces said rights inside my country than it is to force me to fund a military who enforces said rights outside the country. Strangers who happens to be born in the same country as me are not more deserving of my help than any foreigners.
Individual rights exists regardless of borders
"Correct, though largely irrelevant in the context of the topic at hand."
It is not more morally permissible to force me to fund a police force who enforces said rights inside my country than it is to force me to fund a military who enforces said rights outside the country.
"For this to be true, you'd have to argue that sovereignty doesn't exist. Part of what makes a sovereign nation is the defense of it's citizens' rights, which is the states purpose of a police force. Purely domestic. "
"By contrast, using a military to defend the rights of a citizen of another nation would be a violation of that nation's sovereignty. "
Strangers who happens to be born in the same country as me are not more deserving of my help than any foreigners
"True, and in an ideal world, no one's rights would be getting violated by their governments. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, so while those foreigners are no less deserving than domestic strangers, the necessity of respecting their government's sovereignty trumps with respect to foreign intervention."
"Correct, though largely irrelevant in the context of the topic at hand."
"It is highly relevant because libertarianism  is based on individual rights, not the rights of nations. "
"For this to be true, you'd have to argue that sovereignty doesn't exist. Part of what makes a sovereign nation is the defense of it's citizens' rights, which is the states purpose of a police force. Purely domestic. "
"By contrast, using a military to defend the rights of a citizen of another nation would be a violation of that nation's sovereignty."
"There is no such thing as national sovereignty according to libertarian ideology, only individuals and their rights."
"There is no such thing as national sovereignty according to libertarian ideology, only individuals and their rights."
This is patently untrue. This argument only logically works in one of two ways:
"1) If Libertarianism was an imperialistic ideology that sought to spread itself throughout the world, this could be true. Spreading your ideology through military intervention is imperialism. However, libertarians are non-interventionist, so this doesn't work. "
"2) If libertarians were anarchists who didn't believe in the establishment of a state, it would make sense to disregard a nation's claims of sovereignty in the name of protecting individual's rights. However, libertarianism advocates for minimal government, not no government, so this doesn't work either."
"So, you subscribe to some form of anarcho-libertarian or imperialistic libertarian philosophy, the state exists. "
"Beyond that, foreign intervention just... doesn't really work. Look at all the nation building the US and other world superpowers have attempted throughout history. Even with the best intentions, nation building attempts pretty much always make the situation worse for target citizens, so generally speaking you're  at best changing nothing and starting a war when you make some foreign intervention attempt."
This is patently untrue. This argument only logically works in one of two ways:   
"If Libertarianism was an imperialistic ideology that sought to spread itself throughout the world, this could be true. Spreading your ideology through military intervention is imperialism. However, libertarians are non-interventionist, so this doesn't work.  "
"If libertarians were anarchists who didn't believe in the establishment of a state, it would make sense to disregard a nation's claims of sovereignty in the name of protecting individual's rights. However, libertarianism advocates for minimal government, not no government, so this doesn't work either."
"You are putting the cart before the horse. You have to use libertarian principles to derive international non-intervention as a libertartian policy, not the other way around. I agree with you that those two are the only two consistent ideological positions."
Strangers who happens to be born in the same country as me are not more deserving of my help than any foreigners.
Those strangers are paying their taxes into the same government you do. A government’s duty is to their citizens first.
"Borders are arbitrary so long as the same ideology is followed outside them as well. The world does not live in a vacuum. There are things that can happen around the world that effect our lives and out freedoms. Which things do and which things don't are of course up for debate, but it would be incredibly naive to assume an isolationist policy in today's connected world is a good idea."
"I am Lebanese and in the same boat as OP, but I do not support a war."
"I feel for you and hope your revolt is successful. If you want a strong government in your country, your people will have to force it. Even if the U.S. were to topple the Iranian regime, which is unlikely, and Hezbollah left Lebanon, some other group would probably take it's place. The people of Lebanon are your best bet. Good luck"
"Hezbollah may be funded by Iran, but the people aren't Iranian and they won't just throw down the weapons if Iran leaves. At best, they'll continue doing what they do but with less money. At worst, Afghanistan 2.0."
but I think that the extermination of Iran would really have a positive effect on my country.
Extermination? Why would you want to exterminate a country because some leaders are fueling sectarian hate?
"He's from Lebanon. I believe it's just an English as a second language phrasing, I don't think he is suggesting Hitler style eradication."
"Maybe, but I'm aware of several current genocides so I'm not exactly giving a benefit of the doubt."
"It’s not some leaders, it’s all of them, and the most powerful one of them is backed by Iran."
"I'm not sure what that means. All the leaders, even ones like Molavi Abdol Hamid, are a threat to your country? So you want to exterminate all of the Sunnis, Christians, Jews, atheists, and Shia who don't wish any harm on you? Why?"
i too want to bomb the united states congress building sandnigger.
It isn't that there isn't support for your situation it's that American involvement has not always produced the best results. A lot of Americans of tired of foreign wars. This sub leans towards isolationist but in a positive way.
I say fight them if you think that's what you need to do.
"In the case of Hezbollah the people are not going to be able to go toe to toe with them but you may be shocked at how weak their structure really is when it's leadership fails. Their structure is not as sophisticated or redundant as the American military. If we lose a leader another will be able to take their place quickly and effectively bc we cross train and have massive amounts of data, people and money. Hezbollah will have people capable of carrying other duties but not at nearly the depth as they pretend to have. They're much weaker than they portray which is why they have to be so publicly brutal. A lot of their organization is based on connections, who knows who's worked with who ECT. After a couple levels of leadership down it would be much is competent and not have direction. Key figures keep it alive. "
They're more like the cartels than a rigid military structure. For a loose analogy but that's how militias function.
Don't get me wrong they're not incapable and do have resources but what exactly I couldn't tell you. They're also ruthless if need be and that's something to know and fear. You'd know this better than me.
It does leave you vulnerable to not knowing who will take up leadership which could be worse than previous leadership.
To be clear I'm not necessarily talking about violence I'm talking about actively destabilizing their stranglehold. I don't have any specific ideas and may be talking out of my ass but I do believe you could do it. It'll take experience.
"It could be as simple as stealing a cell phone, popping tires or flipping road signs to disrupt something. Maybe someone could help with their tech. Cut power lines ECT. Obviously these aren't huge wins but little ones help. Keep the message unified, be embracing of those with similar goals even if you don't agree on smaller issues."
If you are able to become effective you will find support. I guarantee there are Western intelligence and resources much closer than you think. Lebanon is not that big and not that populated for too much big stuff to go unnoticed. 
You seem like a reasonable person and are aware of how extremism is a turn off.
"But it's going to have to start with you guys. Being smart, being reasonable and being effective. It's possible that some militia members don't really believe anymore. I don't know any specifics and couldn't tell you what will work. That'll take trial and error. But it's going to have to be a consistent effort."
Best of luck and clearly this is my opinion and I hope it helps and I really hope no one gets hurt but I can understand why you're frustrated with the state of your country.
"But it's your country, the people's. Same for every country and if you've got unity you're a lot further ahead than you think."
"1) It is not clear wether a majority of lebanese are revolting. Its not clear how much protesters there are.
2) I am lebanese and would hate a war starting in the middle east as civilians including my and your family could die. There are better ways."
"Well, I do agree with you for the most part, but it is the only way I could see Hezboallah leaving. I may not be thinking as long term as you are, but if you could suggest some other alternative to end this loop of corruption and tyranny."
"Literally wait 25 years and hope. Many things could happen. Iran could implose in protests, a deal between Iran and the Us could be found. Iran could stop funding hezbollah for whatever internal reason, then the war would have less of a cost on lebanese people. Hezbollah could progressively lose their money and support. Oil prices going down could hurt Iran. This kind of stuff."
Uhm. Don’t you think you’re relying on chance a tad too much?
Don't you think relying on foreign intervention will lead to the a similar outcome as post-war Iraq or post-Kaddafi Libya?
I am relying on chance to avoid a war and the potential death of my family b3id el char.
"This is not a American issue, I disagree with trump killing this general because literally none of this is our fucking problem."
"Downvote me if you want, but I have no interest fighting in another war."
Lebanese cuisine is the best cuisine.  I'll take a shish tawook and a fattoush salad any day of the week!
"Haha Agreed brother! There’s a lot more to Lebanese cuisine than shish tawook and fattoush, especially in the area I live in (Tripoli), the food here is truly glorious and a must try."
This whole post is bullshit and completely fucked up. 
"Why would this subreddit upvote a Lebanese person saying Iran should be ""exterminated""?"
"Hey man, that sucks and I feel bad for you and your countrymen for being in that situation. However, we in the US live thousands of miles away. There is no reason we should kill, die, or spend a dime on a war against Iran, no matter who it may benefit. Our government has already been fucking up your region for decades. We boosted Iranian geopolitical power by deposing Sadam, then created ISIS to try and hedge the influence we handed Iran. Wish we never had done any of it but we need to cut our losses and come home, full stop."
"It’s always easy to suggest inaction is the proper move, it’s much more difficult (in the short term) for people to criticize than action is. It’s easy for people to blame Trump for killing a bad dude because there might be retaliation (aka: consequences) but they don’t stop to look at the consequences of doing nothing. No one <em>likes</em> war, we don’t want war, but sometimes you’ve gotta go through the pain of pulling a splinter out to avoid the pain of infection in the future"
but they don’t stop to look at the consequences of doing nothing.
Who doesn't?
"The US military has been in the Middle East for about two decades, and the result has been a region in chaos, murdered civilians, and blowback attacks against us."
The consequences of staying will be more blowback as people are made to hate the US: leaving would make us safer.
"And if the wars have proven anything, it's that US regime change operations end in disaster."
"The region would be a kinder, safer place if the US government had never gotten involved."
"@ The OP, ""the extermination of Iran"" is rather disturbing language."
There is trouble stirring in the Middle East. We do nothing to check them. 9-11 happens. We go to war. Obama decides to be the “good guy” and suddenly pull out of the Middle East. A region that has relied on foreign (basically) policing suddenly has no police. Extremist groups take over. 
"We either fix the problem we made or we let thousands of innocent people (especially women and gays and Jews)  suffer because of it, not to mention the very real and direct threat to our nation."
"I don’t like being the worlds police, but sometimes those able need to do something to protect the rest of the world"
but sometimes those able need to do something to protect the rest of the world
You think that's what we've been doing? We've been spending trillions of dollars just to make things worse.
"9-11 has alot to do with the US involvement in the Middle East. You should read up Osama Bin-Laden reason for his attacks on the US and they tie heavily to alot of the US actions in the middle East before 9-11. The Iran-Iraq war, the dictators they support etc etc."
9-1-1 was blowback from a long history of US military regime change and bombing the crap out of the region for years.
"It would not have happened if the US military hadn’t stoked blowback, as ISIS would not have existed without US destabilization."
"Obama didn’t pull out of the Middle East, he continued the wars and expanded US military involvement to Libya, leading to more chaos and the resurgence of chattel slavery there."
"The US military should not be in the Middle East forever - they need to leave, and there will never be a “good time for it” when the region is peaceful."
"We would be safer if the US military had never set foot in the Middle East, and continued operations there only puts the United States citizens in more danger from blowback."
Look at the history of US involvement in the Middle East and what it has done there: how can you still say that the US military should be fighting there?
"Now 82 days later, we haven’t been able to achieve much, but we’re still fighting"
"Are the protestors calling for the appointment of assessors to appraise land prices, in order to replace all regressive taxes on goods and services with direct annual fees on landowners for holding land out of the public domain?"
The political landscape in Lebanon largely revolves around sectarianism and political parties have been able to thrive of off the use of religion as propaganda to fuel hate among the people
"How western countries stopped the domination of the Catholic Church and allied conservatives was 1) eliminating ability of conservatives to finance public spending using regressive charges on labor such as the Corvée, 2) directly charging land owners for holding land out of public domain, 3) directly charging the Church and religious institutions on the large landholdings they had accumulated which were not being put to use, and 4) auctioning off the property of the Catholic Church for non-payment of taxes."
"There is no question that Iran's government is bad, Iranians themselves want to change it, but the US is always sitting outside their borders waiting to ""liberate"" them, that's why they're too scared to even revolt, fearing that it's going to end up like Syria. Saudi Arabia and Israel are horrible states as well... It's not just Iran. There are no liberty-oriented governments in the ME... But if the US leaves THEN the people can do something about it at least. If the US attacks Iran, first of all they can't afford it, secondly that would leave millions dead and who knows what would happen to any of the countries in the region. Afterall, the war in Vietnam didn't only involve Vietnam, it also involved the surrounding countries."
"Sure. Just like the U.S. made things better in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, etc."
Careful what you wish for friend.
"Lebanese people are my favorite, the country is highly interesting, and the food is out of this world. I’m delighted to see there are lebanese people active in this sub. "
"With that being said, good luck with the ثورة and إيران."
"What is it you imagine, best case scenario, that a hot war with Iran will benefit you &amp; your country in the slightest?  I sympathize with your situation but a fundamentally useless war with Iran benefits no one (minus one sad man's fragile ego)."
​
"And lets be very clear just how sociopathic our present president is; a ground war with Iran will be VERY ugly &amp; bloody and most Americans will not have the stomach for it yet our Orange Snowflake cannot back down ever.  If it isn't obvious, this means, this sociopath will almost definitely use ""tactical nukes.""  He personally as well as his advisors have openly talked of not just their willingness to do this but an actual DESIRE to ""bomb, bomb, Iran"" (I know that is McCain but Trump has expressed the same desire, just not musically)"
​
".....and lets just skip the immediate horror of that and maybe assume only a few MILLION INNOCENT people die; the nuclear door is now wide open.  After having erased the moral high ground of (not) using nuclear weapons, terrorist will be open to do the (previously) unthinkable and nuke an American city or two.  Won't happen overnight but what was previously a terrorist pipe dream will very definitely be set into motion; the families, friends, countrymen, fellow travelers, of the millions of the dead carry a lot of weight."
​
".....see where this goes.  I will defend SOME of Americans rationality &amp; humanity but consider the insanity of ""just"" 2000 dead at 9/11 and multiple that irrationality, fear, &amp; indecency by several million.  If it doesn't happen under whichever president is in office when we are nuked I guarantee you the next president will be riding in on a ""NUKE EVERY LAST ARAB/MUSLIM"" platform....and there you go; the Middle East is a nuclear wasteland in our lifetime.  "
"That outcome is obvious not 100% but if there is a hot war with Iran under THIS president, point out where the logic falls apart.  And that isn't even a worst case scenario."
"You should know that with this “extermination of Iran” the US government wouldn’t just be toppling a regime. They’d be glassing a country. They’d send brainwashed 19 year olds to slaughter people. Soldier, citizen, man, woman, child, it wouldn’t matter. They’d pillage and rape their way through Iran, leaving millions dead and millions more in a state of refuge. They’d destroy cultural sights, install another dictator, and open the country up to invasion by wahhabist terrorists, leaving the country in a state of prepetual warfare. Meanwhile, in the good ol USA, they 24 hour news cycle and MSM would be pumping out propaganda that convinces the American people that Arabs, Muslims, and anyone a couple shades too dark is the enemy. People will take it into their hands to kill Arabs, Indians, Sikhs, because it doesn’t matter what you’re actually bad or not, you looked Muslim and must be the enemy. Hate crimes will shoot through the roof just like they did after 9/11. 
Not to mention what will happen to Lebanon. Your beautiful country is on the list of problem countries in the Middle East. Sure, you can say it’s your government’s fault, but that’s not gonna matter when IDF troops are marching through your streets again, shooting your kids for fun because you’re gourmet to them. It’s not gonna matter when the American drones rain bombs on Beirut and Tripoli turning its building and people into dust, because to the US military, it doesn’t matter what your religion, politics, or ethnicity is, you’re in the way of Israel’s goals and America’s oil. 
My point isn’t that Iran or your current government is good, I’m telling you that you don’t want America, Israel, or anyone else to solve your problems for you because they will destroy your country, people, family and everything else you might hold dear."
Proof of id.
"As problematic as Hezbollah and it's associated Iran ties are, don't you think your country would be completely dominated by Israel without it?"
Israel has had an unsaid peace with pretty much the entire middle East for years now. A lot of it now is lip talk but half the middle East have a common goal with each other and that's against Iran.
Hope our country helps yours. Regardless of what people think.
"While I disagree with some libertarians who use American intervention as a panchreston for ME problems, they have a particular point when it comes to Iran."
You have my sympathy. What safe or leave the country if you can. 
"I hate Iran but the middle East is just so fucked up that I can't see how destroying the IRI would make anything better. Yeah, it might be good for Lebanon, maybe, but it will probably be worse for  millions of other Arabs who suddenly have yet another power vacuum to exploit or get fucked by."
"I see your point about Iran's destabilizing regional goals, however you're missing the core issue: Middle Eastern sectarianism.  Europe spent 200 years fighting over which religious sect would be in charge before finally coming around to ""You cant murder people over religious differences"", and had further wars over ethnic and cultural differences that didnt really sort themselves (mostly) out until the 1940s."
"The Middle East cannot be stable or frankly /functional/ until its people get it through their skulls that ""establishing a regime based on a religious sect"" is a horrible idea.  The same goes for murdering people over ethnic differences (e.g. the Kurds vs the Arabs vs the Persians vs the Jews vs w/e)."
"State actors have negligible power to forment sectarian violence once the people grow the eff up and stop wanting to shank their neighbor because ""they're Sunni and I'm Shiite"" or what have you.  It's the same reason that e.g. if Iran tried to back Anglican militias in the UK to kill those darn Catholics, nothing would happen because the culture had sorted out that such was a terrible, unacceptable idea."
"""Extermination of Iran"""
"Yeah, no thanks. You're welcome to try, but leave the US out of it."
"Dirty Arab, your country has no oil. Sorry."
"Well OP I wish you all the best in life including safety for your family and people. I don’t like war at all but this is a tough situation. Do we sit back and not get involved in things that don’t directly pertain to us or do we stomp out evil when we see people being mistreated and even murdered? I would hope it to be the latter. There is so much anti trump sentiment in the US that our media gives sympathy to the death of a terrorist, even one whose responsible for the deaths of hundreds of our people. A lot of people in the United States are so privileged they don’t understand the true evil that exists in the world"
lebaneses are not arab u literal retard
"Lebanese are the direct descendants of Phoenicians, but do live in the middle east and are directly effected by the outcome of this conflict. 
What a fucking tool."
being affected by a conflict makes someone a specific ethnicity nice logic. also lebanon has a very high chance of not being affected because israel has distanced itself from the conflict and the us knows that if they attack lebanon we will attack israel so its a deterrent. amateur a geo politics i see
"I empathize with your dilemma, but I also think you overstate the popularity of your point of view."
Hezbollah isn't the fault of Iran. It's the fault of the Lebanese government being an oligarchy for a very long time that didn't fill the niche Hezbollah fills in those communities. 
Getting rid of Iran isn't going to fix your local problems.
With all your talks about exterminating Iran you really are a filthy little person.
Lol an upvoted post on Libertarian by an Arab that wants to exterminate Iran.
"Thanks for your TED talk, why don't you message Pompeo so you can speak in front of Congress and drag the US into a major war."
"So, what do you think the US can/should do that would be helpful to Lebanon?  "
"And a question: is there any chance that the Palestinians in ""refugee camps"" for decades now will be offered the chance to integrate into general Lebanese society? Meaning having full citizenship and other rights?"
"If you ever get tired of tyranny and want to, Britain is always open to people open to it though you would probably want to help your own country, good luck with your struggle"
Take a bath
"I agree that Hezbollah is garbage, but exterminating Iran? Jesus Christ."
Thank you for sharing with us.  I feel for your country and hope your country can find peace through Democracy one day.

"Trump doesn't care about Hezbollah.  If he did, he wouldn't have abandoned Syria."
how did Hezbollah's presence affect you?
Hezbollah is one of the least corrupt parties in Lebanon.
Lebanon is one of the most democratic countries in the Arab world.
"among other Arab countries, Lebanon is near the top when it comes to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of the press."
"Hezbollah, even though a religious party. does not try to ban alcohol or dictate what people (specifically women) can or cannot wear."
"can you just focus on the crisis you are in. believe me, Hezbollah should be the least of your concerns at the moment."
I’m having a hard time trying to figure out if you’re being sarcastic or not.
I am not being sarcastic.
all I hear is complains about Hezbollah while the country is sliding into the abyss.
"so, now that you know I am not being sarcastic; how does Hezbollah affect your daily life? are they forcing you to do something you don't want to do? are they preventing you from doing something you want to do?"
Go away you filthy little Arab.
Oh fuck right off you American scum.
"Um okay, I guess I’ll fuck right off then? Poor bastards like you  can’t even own a gun! Have fun fighting you government with signs and tears."
"Uhm. I think you’ve been misinformed. The only upside of all the lawlessness and tyranny in Lebanon is the ability to own any gun. I could buy a rocket launcher if I wanted to.
P.S the fuck right off comment was meant to be taken as a joke."
"Checks profile, active on td, of course."
Fuck right off
"Figures, the racist guy is a statist."
Get out of my sub you filthy statist
Make sure you wipe Trump's semen from your lips before you start talking next time.
"they neglect to incorporate is that the war against tyranny would be a guerilla war, "
"actually they don't neglect this, or you haven't been talking to people who think very deep about this issue."
"Examine guerilla wars.  Really look at how Iraq, Afghanistan, or Vietnam was fought against the occupying power.  They all have foreign sponsors.  You <em>can not</em> prosecute an insurgency without a supply of weapons, food, supplies, munitions, and intelligence.  Indeed our Revolutionary war was sponsored by France in this manor."
"SO, you've decided to take up arms against a tyrannical US government.  Who's going to sponsor you?  Canada?  Mexico?  The EU?  Nope.  The most likely sponsor is going to be <em>enemies of the United States</em> who wish to see the United States weakened or destroyed.  Just like we backed the Mujaheddin against the Soviets.  Or the Soviets backed the Vietcong against us.  Or France backed us against the UK."
"Even if you see yourself as some great freedom fighter (they all do), you're likely doing the bidding of Putin, or North Korea, or Iran. . .or some other nation that really doesn't like the United States.  And if you don't  your insurgency WILL FAIL."
"Also keep in mind guerilla warlords are ruthless.  Again, if you're not, you WILL FAIL."
"It's a lovely romantic thought, but being  a warlord is very sloppy business that involves lots of atrocity and ugly alliances to pull off and very few white hats."
"I agree with everythong you said, but thats why we have the ammendment, the French had just done precisely this to weaken the brits when it was written."
*guerrilla
FUCK THANK YOU
"I support your rights to have guns. I think very, very few people actually support removing all firearms. Most arguments ""anti"" gun are usually just common sense. The fact that it's in the bill of rights is usually argument enough in favor of them. I support your rights, but can we stop fucking using Vietnam, Afghanistan etc as examples of this?"
"You didn't mention it but I'll cover it anyway since it always ends up brought up. First off the US Revolution. Won not solely by dudes with muskets in their basement it was won by French arm sales, and later troops + navy. There were also thousands of muskets and cannons taken through captured British armories. In any straight fight early in the war the continental armies were obliterated by the better trained and equipped British forces. There was also a continent spanning war in Europe that the British were a part of so eventually they just had to say ""fuck it"" and left."
"Vietnam was divided into North and South Vietnam. North was occupied by Soviets, South by Americans. After the French left the US installed an unpopular puppet government which led to guerrilla attacks by the South Vietnamese while arms and troops were smuggled in from the North via ""neutral"" Laos and Cambodia. The US wasn't fighting rice farmers with hunting rifles, they were facing battle hardened insurgents with top of the line (for the time) Soviet weapons. They would ambush American troops then retreat through ""neutral"" territory. The US couldn't attack the North for fear of killing Soviet peacekeepers and inviting literal WW3. So they just occupied the south in a nation that didn't want them there."
"Afghanistan for the Soviets was, again, supplied from outside sources. Foreign fighters flooded in from all over the middle east while they were funded by many western nations including the US. This wasn't a bunch of poppy farmers with AKs, this was an experienced fighting force armed with ground to air missiles who, like with Vietnam, could slip out to Pakistan freely."
"Afghanistan for the US is a bit different. Same concept early on but over the past decade we have invested <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_in_Afghanistan"" rel=""nofollow"">hundreds of billions</a> into upgrading infrastructure, pushing out warlords, supporting individual freedoms etc. The Taliban does still control bits of territory but most of the population centers are solidly under control. Unlike Iraq the Afghans actually have seen significant quality of life improvements. But back to the original point, the Taliban are not some guys with guns, they're a battle hardened well equipped fighting force with decades of combat experience."
Iraq was a mess because of the Shia / Sunni split. Too much to get into in this mess but blah blah blah foreign fighters and arms came in and gave the US occupying forces a lot of trouble.
But most importantly in all these examples is 1) none of these insurgents were supplied by personal firearms and 2) none of them ever actually defeated the US / Soviets. They merely made the occupation costly enough that the superpower left. In your scenario of a tyrannical US forcing a civilian uprising the government will face an existential crisis and fight to the death. You might see yourself as the heroes but you're fighting a guerrilla war against the United States. Where are your arms going to come from? Russia? North Korea? What you see as tyranny probably won't be seen the same for most of your fellow Americans.
"In a REAL US civil war victory (or at least not getting fucking destroyed two months in) would require some support from elements of the US military. Deserters, arms, maybe even a good ol' coup."
"I support your rights to have guns. I think very, very few people actually support removing all firearms. Most arguments ""anti"" gun are usually just common sense. The fact that it's in the bill of rights is usually argument enough in favor of them. "
"I understand its not what you're doing here , but your first statement is so often followed by a laundry list of new regulations that the person suggesting them sees as common sense but would end up with some kinds of seizures or would require a redefinition of our constitutional rights"
But honestly I see your examples as a great reason to allow widespread private ownership of arms. Id rather be in a next to impossoble situation with some means of defending myself than to rely on a foreign government to provide me with arms.
"""It's never worked before but it might work this time."""
"Seriously keep your fucking guns, no one says otherwise. But at least live real life where all the private gun ownership in the world isn't going to defeat a highly trained, well armed army."
"You seem pretty upset
We're living in the same world bud.
One where there's no chance of resistance or rebellion without arms to back it up."
"When the people fer the government there is tyranny, when the government fears the people ( because they are as armed as the government) there is liberty .. an armed society, is polite ( free ) society"
What happens when the people fear the people? (School shootings?) What society is that?
(School shootings?) 
the action of government disarmament
No I mean what kind of society do Americans live in. 
If tyranny is people fearing the government. 
Liberty is the government fearing the people. 
What is it when the people fear the people?
People don't fear the people ...

Americans are shooting each other at an unprecedented rate. 
"All I'm saying is that due amount of gun deaths in America, the terror of an armed population is place directly upon the people. "
"So my question is, what kind of society is it? "
"Because it's not a tyranny, as you described the government aren't suppressing the people. "
"It isn't liberty, because it's not corrupt politicians getting targeted for abuse of power. "
So America must be something else.

More guns in the hands of the people ( not government ) means less violent crime 
The world has a violent crime problem that the US does not because they have made their whole nation a gun free zone just like the places in the US where all the mass shootings occur
Fair play for whipping out all those sources. 
I genuinely do apologise that I'm not gonna have time to go through them all tonight. 
So I just picked out your UK crime statistic. 
"Crime report from 2010/11, so nearly a decade old. "
"""The 2010/11 figures show that the number 
of these offences that did not involve injury has decreased in the past year by four per cent to 
453,310 offences"" (page 59) "
"So there was actually around 1 million violent crime incidents during this year, 45% of which did not involve injury."
"Of which was categorized  ""Possession of firearms with intent"" catalogued  1,381 incidents in 2010/11. (Page 42) "
"With a population of 63.1 million, gives a British citizen a 1 in 45,691 chance of being a victim of gun crime in 2010/11. "
"For a country with pretty strict gun laws, I think 2010/11 was a pretty damn low year for gun violence don't you?"
"Edit for reference: I went by police recorded offensives, not the estimates. I thought that would be more accurate."
"Australia - Violent crime includes homicide, assault, sexual assault, robbery and kidnapping (sometimes referred to as abduction)"
"Canada - homicides, assault, sexual assault, robberies"
"UK -  homicides, assaults, sexual offenses,  robbery"
"US - murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault,"
I think we have gotten way off track here. 
My argument wasn't about the definition of violent crimes. 
My argument was that you had misinterpreted the data from the UK crime report. 
Also back to my original question. What kind of society do Americans live in. 
"If the average American has to live in fear of gun crime, from its own populace. What kind of society is that?"
There’s been false information that’s been peddled in the US about Iran basically since the revolution.
Buzzfeed.  No thanks.
"Buzzfeed is the best in one category, being blatantly biased."
"It surprises me how many people think buzzfeed is credible. You only have to catch one of those, ""10 inventions black people created."" To find out that they are full of shit."
I agree. Unsure why I’m being downvoted.
Because you confused buzzfeed news with buzzfeed. Buzzfeed news is well done using buzzfeed for money.
"This sub is an extention of <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a>. There's not many libertarians here at all. Most are confused as to what libertarianism is.  Here's some upvotes from me."
Buzzfeed news is actually a Pulitzer winning news org. The buzzfeed “what Star Trek character am I” is completely separate and probably is the money arm so they can report solid news at buzzfeed news.

How's that for a progressive icon?"" And I can 100% guarantee you that it's all the proof he needs to believe it."
Well maybe your uncle is an idiot. But my post was a joke.

If a Libertarian was in power the nation would collapse into anarchy pretty much immediately. I doubt they could keep enough ships around to enforce an embargo.
we overthrew their democratically elected government in favor of a dictator in 1953 and it hasn’t been great since then!
"He wasn't that bad. He only killed like 60,000 protestors. Those are rookie numbers."
I’m not sure the “as a non American” qualifier is necessary.  Why would an American understand these things any better than a non American?
we almost exclusively understand these things less
"Idk. For some reason, I keep thinking most Americans closely follow politics."
"It’s all fake bullshit regardless. It’s impossible to know what is true and what is bullshit.  I’m only pretty sure when are being constantly manipulated and lied to for political gain by the left, right, middle, and none of them are interested in the interests of the the people.  The folks in power have goals and other folks in power have other goals and they write stories to convince normal folks to agree with them and hate their fake enemies."
"Before I even start, I do not think any of this justifies a war with Iran. I prefer we not be involved in the region at all, but here we are. My opinion is the only reason it is mentioned he was planning attacks was so that his killing could be justified under US law as a defensive action.   "
"Gen. Soleimani was the head of the Quds Force and heavily involved with/directing multiple Shia militia organizations in other countries, including Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. The US and these militias had a common enemy in ISIS in Iraq and Syria so they sort of left each other alone. It seems the agreement was we won't kill you if you don't kill us sort of thing. Last month the PMF ( A Shia and Iran linked and funded militia) executed a rocket attack on a base in Iraq killing one US contractor and injury 5 or 6 military personal. I am not sure if this was a mistake or intentional, I have not read enough about it and can't find english sources for information on it. The US retaliated by attacking a bunch of shia militia based in Iraq and Syria, this upset the PMF (and other Shia) and that led to the protest and burning of part of the US embassy. I don't think there is any question as to  Soleimani's involvement with the shia militias, I mean he was in Iraq for a reason. As evidence of his involvement, one of the other people killed in the drone attack on his vehicle was the head of the PMF (the militia that burned part of the US embassy and killed the US contractor). No idea if Soleimani was planning any new attacks, seems like a reasonable thing for him to be doing in this situation. Again, I prefer we just leave that area to the world to the Shia and Sunni so they can finish their power struggle."
"As evidence of his involvement, one of the other people killed in the drone attack on his vehicle was the head of the PM"
"I agree with you that we should not be involved there in the first place, but this is the part people are missing. My guess is we were tracking this militia leader and happened to come across an opportunity for a twofer. "
"I think conventional military commanders would have not killed the general, but I think Trump saw this as a political move to justify his actions against Iran and also put his political opponents in the position of defending Iran witch is going to make them look really bad come main campaign season once Iran carries out a few terrorist attacks. "
Where if we had just killed the militia leader no one would even be talking about this story.
There's no evidence at all for anything Trump or conservatives are claiming
Even if there was evidence it's not justification to start a war with Iran
This is just wmd 2
So the attack on the US embassy is just a claim?
"The 'attack' was a protest that got out of hand and damaged a few buildings at the edge of the embassy complex (context, the US embassy in Baghdad is the largest embassy in the world and the equivalent size of Vatican City.)."
The protestors who the US formally supported in November are not the Iranian military
"US embassies get attacked quite often (i wonder why when we keep fucking up other countries), this attack is claimed to be perpetrated by Iran. I have yet to see any convincing evidence of that. And honestly, I have been lied so much during the Iraq war that it would take some very convincing evidence before I will care."
"Shit, last year we had people throw grenades at the embassy in Montenegro and the consulate in Guadalajara, and a bomb outside the embassy in Beijing.  Molotov cocktails thrown at the embassy in Uzbekistan in 2015.  Suicide bomber at the embassy in Turkey in 2013.  Literally the same day as the Benghazi attack, protesters scaled the walls of the embassy in Cairo, and 3 days later in Yemen and Tunisia.  Nicaragua in 2009."
"Even if it was totally them, is it something to start a war over?"
"No, especially considering how much Iranian blood we have spilled for the terrible crime of ""not being totally on our side during the cold war"". But tell that to the ""libertarians"" here who get so excited about fighting brown people, or more accurately, others fighting brown people. "
This whole Iran thing has shown pretty clearly that is not socialists who have taken over the sub but right wingers.
"No, especially considering how much Iranian blood we have spilled for the terrible crime of ""not being totally on our side during the cold war""."
"Well that and nationalizing British assets.  Not to justify the 1953 coup, but it might be worth pointing out that the US was under a great deal of pressure by our strongest ally."
"But tell that to the ""libertarians"" here who get so excited about fighting brown people, or more accurately, others fighting brown people."
"I don't really see a whole lot of public support for a war with Iran, even among Republicans."
"Idaho is one of the darkest-red states in the Union and the GOP there <a href=""https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2020/01/06/idaho-republican-party-passes-antiwar-resolutions/"" rel=""nofollow"">just passed an anti-war resolution</a> yesterday.  I haven't found a poll specifically about the idea of war with Iran conducted yet in January, but recent national polls show strong opposition.  For example, <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/265640/americans-war-iran.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Gallup, August 2019</a>: 72% of Republicans prefer economic/diplomatic efforts over war with Iran."
I will believe that republicans do not support the war when they actually put their votes where their mouth is. Republicans constantly proclaim that they are against things then vote for them anyways.
Farmers hating the farm subsidies yet voting for a republican who gives them subsidies for the 100th time in a row comes to mind
The general was killed in the same car as the leader of the militia that carried out multiple attacks in Iraq. Just wrong place wrong time I suppose.
"Ooooh, is this a new and fresh redcap talking point? Could we get some evidence of this statement? Because so far we have lies on top of lies."
"<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-airstrike-al-muhandis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-airstrike-al-muhandis.html</a> "
It is what is being reported. I don't have access to classified information to provide any further proof. Do you have any proof to counter that claim other than conspiracy theories?
"Except I see no proof that the guy was the one behind the embassy attack. All we know is that USA attacked a militia, pro-militia citizens attacked the USA's embassy and an Iranian general who was invited to discuss the deescalation of the situation was hit with a missile strike. The fact that they were together is not really a mystery either since one was an iranian general and the other one was a pro-iranian militia leader. At the end of the day, who the fuck are we to decide who gets to be in charge of the place?"
"Overall, i just find it adorable how quickly <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a> went from ""was is bad"" to ""WE KILLED THE DUDE, HELL YEAH"""
The NYT article describes his background and the attack and how he may be involved. 
The protesters are reported to be militia members and he as one of the few who could organizer the various militias into one group. 
"I don't think we should be there at all, but these guys are terrorists attacking targets in Iraq and other countries in the middle east. Not liking the outcome of these long conflicts with roots going back before most of us were born, but that doesn't change the facts. "
Iran wants more control and influence in the middle east. Being nice to Iran and trying to appease them isn't going to change that. 
Personally I don't care who runs things there. We should just buy oil from whoever is selling it and move on.
"Our terrorists, their freedom fighters. If your only justification for that missile strike is that ""let terrorists die"" then I really hope you never find yourself called a terrorist because you have just established the precedent for your own death."
I am in no way justifying anything. Just analyzing the situation.
Someone is bias.
"I'm going to start right here first. Iran wasn't responsible for the killing of 1000's of innocent Americans on 9/11. Saudi Arabia was though. It is a fact that the SA Govt trained, financed, provided logistics for and sheltered a majority of the terrorists on 9/11. Iran's state sponsored religion doesn't raise children believing that any, not only non-muslim, but non Sunni Muslim is a heretic and must be killed. Saudi Arabia does though in Wahhabism. Iran doesn't supply the world with more terrorists than any other country. Saudi Arabia does. Iran didn't invade Yemen because their citizens overthrew their corrupt, puppet regime. Saudi Arabia sure as fuck did though. I could go on and on with this bullshit but I'm gonna stop there. NO country in the Middle East has done more to the US or rest of the world than SA, yet we make Iran out to be the bad guy, always. Oh, and while we are at it, Trump gave SA the ability to make nukes! Without going through any channels he was supposed to. Breaking yet another piece of legislation to do whatever he wants. That one isn't spoken about much though. "
"While these current events matter, what was coming with regards to Iran was written in stone when Trump did some very idiotic things. Mainly, pulling out of the Nuke Deal, which was done, like a lot of things Trump does, without any real plan. Just do it and see what happens. The only thing he has said(and any supporter) was that it was a ""bad deal"". No substance to that, just a ""bad deal"" so the supporters just all repeat the same dumbass line, not knowing shit about if it actually was or not. All while every other fucking country out there wanted it to continue. Then bringing on NeoCons like Bolton and Pompeo, who like so many other conservatives out there, have this hard-on for Iran. "
"So, Trump brings on people who openly want to take out the leadership of a country, kills the nuke deal, essentially killing Iran from within by strangling their economy, which in turn, would make them do something in retaliation. Then one small thing turns into us droning a General? "
"Of course, this whole deal is being pushed by fucking Israel, who would love nothing more than us being in wars constantly in the Middle East. For all we know, had it not been for those fuckers, the Iran Nuke Deal may never have been needed. We were fucking their shit up with the Stuxnet worm but they just couldn't control themselves and, released it all over the world trying to damage stuff more. I think they sabotaged it on purpose. "
"Netanyahu facing serious, serious charges of bribery and corruption, while our President is being impeached. You think either one of these 2 fuck sticks wouldn't want a war distraction?"
"I'm really not trying to be a sympathizer with Iran, it's just the hypocrisy of the things our admin says that they do boggles my fucking mind."
"Also, if the US embassy was attacked, what was the reason?"
It wasn't attacked. There was a protest and some property at the gate was damaged.
"They also torched the security buildings and lobby of the embassy. 
It wasn’t simply knocking a gate over. "
"<a href=""https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/02/photos-reveal-damage-to-us-embassy-in-baghdad-following-attack-by-supporters-of-iran-backed-militia/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/02/photos-reveal-damage-to-us-embassy-in-baghdad-following-attack-by-supporters-of-iran-backed-militia/</a>"
"With the scale of the embassy in Baghdad, it was essentially burning the gate house while pointedly avoiding going into the embassy. It was a show of force, and no one was killed. Certainly not something that needed retaliation."
"That lobby was at the gate. Yes, there was some minor damage from a protest. There was no attack."
You don’t consider burning the lobby of a building and destroy a couple of guard buildings an attack?
I guess we have much different definitions of an attack. 
"I assume you’d be ok with someone torching your garage, as long as they left your house alone? That’s still arson and an attack in my book."
"I do not consider a protest at embassy that resulted in some property damage to be an attack by a foreign nation. They fired no bullets, drop no bombs, hurt no one."
Iran attacked saudi oil production. We said dont fuck with our oil supply so death to more brown people. Basically a continuation of the last 20 years foreign policy.
"Its going to be great when gas will be woth less than clean water when we are energy efficient. Other countrys will need it, but with the us producing more gas and more electric, the oil countrys will be hurting."
You think Iranians are brown people?
Iranian backed militias attacked an Iraqi military base resulting in the death of a US contractor.
"The Pentagon presented several options to Trump, from striking back at the specific militias, to taking out the Iranian General in charge of the militias."
"Trump took the more moderate response of bombing the militias, which took place."
The militias then responded by attacking the US embassy.
"After that, and probably concerned about looking weak after the media started labeling this ""Trump's Bengazi"", Trump gave the go ahead for taking out Soleimani."
They didn't attack the embassy. There was a protest that resulted in some fire damage to the lobby at the gate.
"Really? I recall footage of objects being thrown, windows being bashed in, and stuff being stolen (suggesting the walls had been breached), like a large brass (?) US emblem. That sounds like more than ""fire damage to the lobby at the gate."""
A spokesperson with the U.S. State Department told Military Times Tuesday that protesters never breached the embassy
"You've been misled. It's not uncommon. There was some damage to the lobby at the gate, where the emblem was taken. It was a protest. They never shot at the embassy. They never bombed the embassy. They never through grenades at the embassy. No one was hurt. The embassy was never breached..."
"You also left out that our drone strike of the militia killed like 30 people, and likely also resulted in civilian deaths as many of our drone striked do (we just don't report the number of civilians killed because it would make the US look bad).  This is why they were protesting."
"We and they have spies on both sides. The intelligence community is what they claim is the cause. Obama declared him a terrorist. I dont like the Orange Orangatang in chief, except he said he wanted to not get involved in wars. It will be interesting if he drops more than the 26,000 bombs as his predecessor did."
She only found out he’d died by googling him on a whim <strong>six weeks after his death</strong> to find his obituary in the New York Times. 
A few words later:
"<strong>About a week after her father’s death</strong>, she went to his home to collect his belongings. "
WTF?
"She looted the house, then five weeks later found out he was dead the whole time."
"She stole the data beforehand, and finding out broke his heart."
"Just classic Vice editing diligence. Idk if they don't have an editor or are just always in a rush to ""break"" a story or what but most of their articles have typos or other errors."
"Journalists who don't confirm, source and double check everything simply are not worthy of the name journalist."
Agree 100%. Huge lack of journalism integrity. It’s become who is first not who is right.
Free market journalism at its best
It's true.  Can't blame the media for being shit when there is little demand for good journalism.
"Likely a typo for ""a week after learning of his death"""
Vice stays very busy pulling things out of their ass they can’t worry with editing
She sounds like a lovely person...
"They were estranged, and I'm sure it had just as much to do with her shitstain of a father as it did with her."
Imagine letting politics alienate you from your own children/parents.
Goddamn some people have their priorities way out of whack.
"It sucks, but it’s pretty common too. It’s especially hard to maintain a relationship when one side is so heavily indoctrinated. Not to mention nearly anything is political nowadays."
when one side is so heavily indoctrinated.
<em>redditors nodding their heads knowingly as they're clearly talking about the other side.</em>
The difference between indoctrination and education is whether or not you agree.
"Education opens the mind, indoctrination closes it."
"A handy heuristic, until you try to apply it."
"I have applied it! Left a cult, learned many different skills, read many different books, met many different people. Education is pretty cool."
That's an exciting story.
You should write a book so other people can be educated.
"It's really not lol, I'm hardly the first person to do so."
The data on which side is more likely to disavow friends and family over politics is pretty  clear.
Let's see it.

"Hey, I’m an anarchist, but I like visiting the right libertarian sub occasionally. Just wanna say that you’d be a great parent. I obviously disagree with you politically, but I can absolutely respect that."
But would a kid with a loving dad ever become a communist though?
Fair point
Usually it’s Fox News addled parents becoming openly hostile with their children. 
Militant communists aren’t very numerous as they are generally disliked even by other leftists.

"It also depends a lot on the line between politics and personal values.  Like, I can quibble with someone over tax rates - I have friends who support everything from complete free market health care with no licensing to supporters of single payer systems."
"However, in the case of this dude, from what we've heard the racism crept in pretty strong.  Many Republicans unfortunately have bought in to the racist wing of the party and it informs their vote.  I couldn't maintain a friendship with someone who opposition to immigration was rooted in the race/culture of immigrants or parroted Trump's lines about refugees and immigrants.  That trancsends politics but will inform their political views."
It’s especially hard to maintain a relationship when one side is so heavily indoctrinated.
"For weak people, sure."
That’s the thing. The indoctrinated think <em>they</em> are the strong ones.
Politics? Or are you saying he didn't want her to have custody bc of her politics.  
Stephanie had been estranged from her dad for several years before his death — they’d gotten into a fight over the custody of her children that made its way to court
"Actually they were alienated due to him threatening to report her to Child Protective Services for neglect after she went to a women's shelter to escape her abusive husband and they for some reason sent her dad all of her info. He said he'd get her kids taken unless she consented to giving custody to him, which she did. Then he just gave his own grandchildren to foster care and now they've been adopted and she'll never see them again."
He was a 100% piece of shit.
"He may be a piece of shit, but your account is 100% backwards. He and his wife were granted custody because the daughter refused to leave, or testify against, the husband that she accused of beating and torturing her for 10 years."
"<a href=""https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/legal_affairs/mother-takes-toddler-from-legal-guardians/article_710d1828-e0e0-5c7b-966e-c1e979575060.html"">https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/legal_affairs/mother-takes-toddler-from-legal-guardians/article_710d1828-e0e0-5c7b-966e-c1e979575060.html</a>"
That contradicts nothing I said.
"Are you having a stroke? You said the dad threatened the daughter after she left her abusive husband while the next post claims they were given custody when the daughter refused to leave her abusive husband. Literally the exact opposite. I have no idea which account is accurate, just pointing out they are indeed at odds with each other."
She did leave him. She refused to testify against him.
"Yeah some people are on their family's side no matter how horrible, immoral, or lethally evil they are."
"Dude, I used to agree with this, but it's kinda ridiculous if you really think about it. Politics shape the world, they define law and how people treat each other in a lot of cases. It doesn't surprise me at all. Political beliefs often go a lot farther than ""well uhhhh taxes bad"""

"It was brave to dump a dead man’s computer in the internet? Snowden, Manning, and Assange are brave because they are dealing with consequences they were aware of before they acted."
"The whole issue of gerrymandering highlights a problem inherent with democracies, namely that populations move but geography doesn’t. There is no possible way to divorce a democracy from geography, and there is no possible way to divorce a democracy from a population. Why in the world they don’t just make the districts out of the already existing counties (or parishes)?"
Dont think that the democrats dont have a few of these stooges as well. The entire gerrymandering is out of control by both sides. Good for her though to expose this crap.
"Every thread about Republicans someone has to remind us of Democrats, every thread about Democrats no one is reminding us about Republicans"
"I hate to say it but yes, I agree there is more shade in one direction sometimes here. We should shade all equally."

"Yes, I suppose that's true. Merit based shaming"
i think shaming only works in person. no one give a fuck about downvotes or other peoples opinions online.
I call out Illinois. Go look at some of our districts.  A blind three year old with a crayon could do a better job.
"Are they gerrymandered due to politics, or race? I'm aware of a district ""eating"" another that was done to combine two Puerto Rican neighborhoods split by a black neighborhood so each would have a rep instead of the vote from splitting the black neighborhood dominating birth districts."

Because they had the majority in 2010. Democrats have also benefited in the past due to it. 
"However, the real tell about whether Democrats <em>actually</em> consider this a problem is if they move to change the system if they gain majority in 2020, or if they simply take advantage of it because it's ""their turn""."
"They've been trying to change the system for at least 10 years, through legislation and the courts, while the GOP does everything they can to stop it."
"They've been trying to change how the Republicans did it in 2010.

"I have serious doubts about shortest split lines, but I'm down with it as long as it uses existing county or city lines to avoid cracking a city."
Agreed
Interesting.  Can I ask why you have a neoliberal flair by the way?  I thought the whole point of libertarianism was it’s not supposed to be measured in terms of left and right.
Neoliberal and classic liberalism are not very closely related to what the current meaning of liberal is.   Talk radio started using it as a slur for the entire left after a few leftists where also liberals about 40 years ago and the term shifted.  
"But from the dictionary definition, that both neo and classical liberalism mean, it’s not really mapped to either party.   Probably slightly closer to the right but neoliberalism is heavily represented in both parties."
Interesting thank you for the info man I’ll read into it more anybody who wants more liberty and freedom is cool in my book.
They tend to want a lot of economic freedoms.  They aren’t actively anti personal freedoms but are certainly less concerned with those issues.  
Or I suppose more fairly believe that personal freedoms will follow economic freedoms.  But history is littered with examples that show otherwise.  
There was a post on here the other day about whether an employer should be able to require their employees to vote certain ways in elections.   The classical and neo approach would and did say yes to that question.
"Neoliberal, and to a lesser extent classical liberal, are often used more for international geopolitics than for domestic politics, and those who associate themselves with neoliberalism may still hold many libertarian ideas. When it comes to individual liberty I'm about as libertarian as it gets. Yet I also recognize that government has a legitimate role in regulating industry to protect consumers and enforce contracts/fraud, that there are always going to be people who need a social safety net, and that anywhere around the globe that the US doesn't exert influence we open the door for Russia or China to exert influence. The bedrock of my belief system is that people have the right to be free to live their lives in peace, and for that reason I am a libertarian. But, because I understand that we also have to be practical, I am also a liberal/neoliberal. I just go with moderate libertarian, but all of these belief systems are very much interrelated."
"I'm not a libertarian, I'm a neoliberal, which promotes capitalism, efficient taxation, free trade, immigration, government management and oversight of market failures, and welfare programs. I'm here because my views overlap but I'm definitely not one."
Oh ok I agree with pretty much all of that.  And fair enough glad to have you I think we agree with a lot.

"35 years of anecdotal evidence living in California, and seeing how both sides move the lines constantly. But go ahead and pretending it doesnt happen by both sides."
35 years of anecdotal evidence living in California
"California has, quite literally, a citizen-ran redistricting committee.  Politicians have nothing to do with it.  "
And that was put in place... by the Dems
So yeah you're full of shit man
"Edit: haha, quoted the wrong post, my apologies, corrected"
"35 years of anecdotal evidence living in California, "
Oh so you're lying.
California hasn't been meaningfully gerrymandered since AHNALD
So basically you’re full of shit.
So there's cases you can cite where Democrats are illegally or unconstitutionally redistricting?
"This is a game. Don't waste time with this guy. See, what the Republicans are doing is legal and constitutional. Even if we don't like it. Democrats gerrymander as well and in that case it's still legal and constitutional. Partisan nutbags."
"Everyone pay attention to this and see if Democrats have a majority next time lines are redrawn. If they <em>actually</em> think gerrymandering is bad, they'll look to change the system. If they only feel it's a problem when Republicans get to draw the lines, then they'll keep the system as is and just redraw the lines."
We'll see.
They literally are changing the system in states where they have power though. See California and Virginia.
"So if the courts dont call it gerrymandering, then that's okay? Swell, GOP just need to pack the courts, then its all good."
However Maryland and Illinois are gerrymandered. Illinois even legally gerrymsndered. Yes the courts gerrymandered the state.
The point is that the GOP is dramatically worse. Dramatically dramatically worse.
To the point is wholely incomparable to place the two next to each other.
The amount of minority won representation the Republicans have is absolutely staggering
The point is that 
"All gerrymandering should be fought. Dont get hung up on worse. This is black and white issue. All gerrymandering must end. Democrat. Republican. Libertarian, green. Blue, yellow, Nazi. Socialist, communist, Jerads."
All.
"It should be fought, I agree"
I think the concept of man made districts is inherently a subversion of justice
"But there is absolutely without a doubt a worse of two evils. When confronting the two, attack the extremes because as long as they can exist everything before them thrives"
"When confronting the two, attack the extremes "
"Why do you think people are shitting on you, extremist?"
"""Gerrymandering is fine when my side does it, but not when they do it!"""
You're just another partisan.
"You’re literally lying through your teeth again, you fucking hack."
If democrats weren't the ones leading the fight for neutral districting you'd have a point.
"But like it or not they are, so you dont"
The point is that 
you are a partisan.
....this is a Libertarian forum... everyone here should be partisan towards Libertarians
Or apparently against the GOP.  Hmm.
Whom are the biggest threat to libertarianism at the moment considering gerrymandering
Yes
"Well they are the tyrants in charge who have been nailed to rights for the most extreme Gerry mandering, election fraud and reducing personal freedoms"

"Gerrymandering actually benefits democrats more, as they're more densely concentrated in key geographical areas. If you randomly split a state into districts by population, it's several times more likely to benefit Republicans as they're more evenly distributed. "
"Obviously both parties are guilty of gerrymandering, but there's a reason why Republicans are more represented in state level legislature. It's because while 40 metro district might be D75-R25, 60 rural districts might be D45-R55. That means that in terms of pure numbers, Democrats are the majority, but Republicans hold most of the districts."

yep.
and billionaires got a trillion dollar PER YEAR tax break.
all hail the american oligarchy!
And don't forget the billionaires trillion dollar per year cut doesnt expire where the peanuts for the rest of us does expire.
We can't afford the peanuts anymore because we need to fight terrorists for our freedom.
That's a lie. Billionaires alone did not get a $1 trillion/year tax break.

Bullshit. Even homeless dudes pay sales taxes.
"Headline is a bit misleading. It's not surprising that in the very short run Chinese exporter prices don't fall: contracts are in place with pricing specified. When new contracts are written they may will be priced in light of the extra ""tax"" added by the tariffs (assuming those are still in place), and would likely specify lower prices paid to the producers, or they might even be switched to different (non-Chinese) sources like Viet-Nam, India, or other low-cost producers. "
"The underlying study (of which only the abstract is available without payment) also says the tariffs were paid by US ""consumers and importers."" The ""importers"" (who could be US or foreign-owned trading firms, or US wholesalers or retailers) may or may not have passed all or part of the tariff charges to final consumers. "
"Plus, the article suggests that US imports from China declined following imposition of the tariffs. That is definitely a cost to China, and a corresponding benefit to other foreign sources or even competing US producers who win the business that China lost. "
"So, yes, US consumers have paid some of the tariff ""tax"", maybe even most of it in the short run. But it's very likely that soon either Chinese exporters will have to accept  lower prices or loss of business, or the tariffs will be eliminated in the context of a US-China trade deal."
Did anyone really need to research this? It's basic knowledge.
They also explained that the way trump is using tariffs is working.
Did we read the same article?
"So the effects of tariffs, which were increased this fall, may have not yet been fully seen. "
after we see those effects its going all the way up to 100% even MORE!
this is a symptom of news orgs printing salacious and eye catching headlines (gotta get clicks)
"but putting the ""truth"" in the article somewhere.... they arent ""lying"", they're being liberal with their words is all"
"Sure did, my friend."
"So the effects of tariffs, which were increased this fall, may have not yet been fully seen. "
So what does this mean in your own words?
That we have not seen the full effects of the tariffs. It's a true statement. Tariffs are a powerful tool.
Did they explain that the Yuan being devalued 10% makes 10% tariffs a wash to the consumer? And that the Chinese items not tariffed are now cheaper helping lead to a lower inflation rate than before the trade war?
"Click on the article, then follow the hyperlink to the article's source paper. Read the researcher's own words there (also below)."
"Using data from 2018, a number of studies have found that recent U.S tariffs have been passed on entirely to U.S. importers and consumers. These results are surprising given that trade theory has long stressed that tariffs applied by a large country should drive down foreign prices. Using another year of data including significant escalations in the trade war, we find that U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers. We show that the response of import values to the tariffs increases in absolute magnitude over time, consistent with the idea that it takes time for firms to reorganize supply chains. We find heterogeneity in the responses of some sectors, such as steel, where tariffs have caused foreign exporters to drop their prices substantially, enabling them to export relatively more than in sectors where tariff passthrough was complete."
you could actually read the article.
"EDIT: so it was about 0.14 back in 2016, and it is 0.14 now.   Not really seeing the effect in exchange rate."
The start of the trade war was April 2018 when it was 6.3/1. Its now 7/1. 
6.3 x 10% = .63
6.3 + .63 = 6.93
A 10% tariff is associated with about a 10% drop in imports for the first three months
"This is what hurts China, who's major export is labor. This is why tariffs are really the only thing that can hurt their economy. They keep their people poor just so they can work harder for whatever comforts they have."
"If they devalue the yuan, they just make it harder for their labor pool to purchase comforts. Labor costs increase and the prices go up, then up again due to tariffs lowering demand meaning they have to cut supply which lowers their labor pool. "
Tariffs as a general rule is a bad idea unless you are communist and want them to regulate the market. They are incredibly effective weapons against communist countries because you can manipulate their labor pool.
Why should I care. They are consumers. They don’t produce anything of value.
We are all consumers.
China is evil. Raise the tariffs even higher.
"Remind me, which libertarian doctrine states that the USA shall play the role of judge and jury for nations around the world?"
"I'm not asking to send you off to war to stop them, but I don't think it's too big an ask to just not support genocidal regimes."
"Tariffs are just fancy taxes on your own people. You want a boogaloo on the Chinese government, smuggle military hardware."
I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  I'm happy to call myself a Libertarian and also have no problem waging economic war against nations that violate my ideals of liberty to such an extreme.
"The tariffs are almost all paid by multinational corporations, whether they're based in America, China, Europe, etc. Sometimes they pass it along to consumers with higher prices. Or cut costs. Sometimes they don't."
"Interestingly, wage growth for workers has been higher than any time in the last 10 years, with wage growth the highest for low income people. It appears that workers have been benefiting from there now being a benefit to producing your goods in America so you don't have to pay tariffs."
"Wage growth if you ignore inflation and the growing deficit, sure. Any evidence that the tariffs have helped the U.S. produce more goods?"
The military has government run housing. When will that get cut from the budget?
Sounds more like upkeep is shit. 
That sounds like most landlords.
From the article:
"McDougald Terrace, built in 1953, is the authority’s oldest and largest public housing community. It is inspected by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees housing authorities."
"Inspectors look for health and safety hazards, like smoke detectors, insects and emergency exits, as well as physical damage to the exterior and interior, such as mold, electric work, ventilation for gas and water heaters and inoperable kitchen equipment."
"In 2018, federal inspectors gave it a score of 34 out of 100, The News &amp; Observer previously reported. A 60 is considered failing."
The most recent inspection noted 72 health and safety deficiencies and projected there were about 820 on the property.
"About 24 of the deficiencies were considered life threatening with a projected total of 331 on the property. Deficiencies included insect and roach infestations, mold, a misaligned chimney, and problems with ventilation for gas and water heaters."
"Ok, how does that compare to private? My landlord didn't have smoke detectors either."
The consequences of never spending money on upkeep.
Stop arguing.
"I mean...a lot of people <em>do want tyranny</em>, so long as it's aimed at thee instead of me."

With a title like this how can a reasonable discussion not happen?
...I mean look at Trump supporters. He’s authoritarian and people love it.
"Basically no one wants a real gun ban. But that said ""defeating tyranny"" is the dumbest fucking argument. At no point in human history has personal gun ownership defeated an overwhelmingly powerful force like the US army. There's a case to be made for private militas but I can all but guarantee most of you reading this have nothing to do with one."
"Before you piss yourself talking about how the US was defeated in Vietnam or the British in the revolution no, neither were defeated, they just voluntarily elected to abandon occupied territory. A real US civil war would be a battle to the death, as the loser is completely destroyed. A shotgun in your basement isn't going to take out a real US fighting force at least not without unsustainable casualties."
"The real way to win a civil war / uprising is to have 1) the support of the people (which based off the Libertarian view of what tyranny is, you probably won't have) and 2) the support of foreign powers to transport you actual real weapons, food, supplies etc. What allies do you think you'll get fighting the US govt, North Korea? Russia? ISIS? Ah what a great American hero you'll be, fighting side by side with Russian Spetznaz."
"Keep your guns. I 100% agree you should have them. But don't lie to yourself thinking you'll be re-creating Red Dawn and be the hero to everyone. If you actually face off against a highly trained, well equipped army you'll be decimated."
"Considering gun owners outnumber the us military 50 to 1 and that’s still considering all the millitary would fight its own people, I think gun owners have a good chance. And you saying that the civilians won’t be as equipped as the us millitary so it won’t win is just a reason why we should have acces to things such as full auto rifles"
Considering gun owners outnumber the us military 50 to 1
"In no scenario would all those people, or even a tiny fraction of them take up arms against the US govt and start shooting soldiers. Fuck if anything a greater percent of them will take the side of the government."
"and that’s still considering all the millitary would fight its own people,"
Yet the people are going to be the ones all fighting against the military? No the real scenario is going to be more complex.
I think gun owners have a good chance.
"Again, it's not going to be gun owners vs the military, it's going to be a small group of people who decide to start an armed resistance against the US govt. For this to work they need the support of the population AND foreign forces. As said before the most likely allies to a revolution against the US would be thinks like NK, Russia etc. It will be very difficult for you to be ""the good guys"" in anyone's eyes."
And you saying that the civilians won’t be as equipped as the us millitary so it won’t win is just a reason why we should have acces to things such as full auto rifles
"You can legalize tanks, it doesn't matter. It's a numbers game and most gun owners aren't willing to buy military grade hardware or turn that hardware on their fellow soldiers. They just want a pistol to defend their family."
"This is what I’ve never understood. The average American isn’t going to risk their family’s lives, the lives of their child, their nice house and car, and their entire livelihood. People will sit down and shut up when the alternative is seeing their family killed. "
Only a small group will be willing to take those risks.
Whether you belive that people will rise up in arms or not dictates the rest of the logic and that’s where we fundamentally disagree
Because you live in a fantasy world where the US turns into a dictatorship overnight and suddenly you have millions of individuals digging the guns out of their basement and rushing on Washington like in some video game.
That's not how the world works.
"It’s obviously not going to happen overnight, rights are stripped one by one so people don’t think it’s worth fighting for. That’s why I oppose every small bit of federal gun control and I think it’s time we took back our freedoms"
"Fascism is the result of a popular movement. Guns don't protect your rights, because any authoritarian regime with half a brain will co-opt gun-lovers by telling them what they want to hear and promising them that the state will turn a blind eye to their violence if they play along."
Your rights are trampled every day. When's the magic moment when you will resist?
We will see what happens in Virginia. That’s the very reason we need more people to stand up for our rights.
"In other words, You care more about your ability to own a gun than the things that the gun is supposed to be protecting you from. What good is the gun if you concede the freedoms you tell me it protects?"
It may seem like that because no other right is under attack so aggressively. Or correct me if I'm wrong?
It's the only area that gets blindsided by extreme legislation day after day. But I don't see where we conceded other freedoms so easily?
But when is enough is enough? Indeed.
"Off the top of my head, reproductive rights, voting rights, and police brutality are of significantly more concern. Take some time and read through this sub, you'll find that this community of self-identified libertarians is split on these issues."
"To no surprise to you probably, disagree on 'significantly more concern'...
Do you really forsee those issues improving with a disarmed society? 
🍻🖖🏽☮️"
Can you give me any example in human history where private firearms were the tipping point that defeated a real military that wasn't dependent on outside funds and foreign fighters?
"well there's a loaded question when I see one. You obviously included ""tipping point"" intentionally."
So do you have no examples?
"The example that hits home for me is Mughal-Sikh Wars. (i'm of Sikh decent). No government or foreign aid helped the Sikhs against the genocide, instead it was the people who took arms (weapons of their time)."
"In  every one of those cases, the folks more likely to be armed are on the 'less liberty' side of the debate. So disarming them isn't something I'll lose sleep over."
This is particularly unhinged.

"Good, libertarians support the right to unionize"
They also support removing all the protections unions have to stop employers from firing unionizers.
That's anarchists / corporate sycophants
Thats the Libertarian party. So quite a bit more then ancaps.
"Businesses are free to discharge employees as they please so long as it doesn't violate contract. Since that be boilerplate clause for a business, unions would be free to form in the unemployment line."
"Nope, that's libertarians."
"Hence why you're not a libertarian, and are instead a worthless piece of tankie shit."
"For future reference, because you're too fucking stupid to figure this out on your own, an employer does not owe you a job or money.  They are free to fire you for any reason whatsoever--that is their right.  Attempting to restrict that right is authoritarianism."
And here we see how <strong>ALL</strong> forms of socialism require authoritarianism to implement.
"Thanks for playing, you dumbass fucking tankie troll."
"While your information in the middle is mostly correct, your insulting tone won't actually get anyone to care, at all."
"Also, they cant fire you outside the contracted permissible reasons."
"While your information in the middle is mostly correct, your insulting tone won't actually get anyone to care, at all."
"Oh, <em>no.</em>"
You mean the known Chapo troll Retardican_President might not change his mind if I'm not nice to him?
"You mean the gang of Chapos who skulk around this sub to brigade it like Codefuser told them to, who all jump into comments sections together to brigade any comment which disagrees with them, and who call libertarians ""bootlickers"" are really just waiting for <em>thoughtful discussion</em>?"
"Press ""X"" to doubt."
"You'll never change these people's minds, because they don't have minds.  You can't change their thinking, because they don't think.  They're worthless dumbass tankie trolls who are only here to undermine what libertarianism is and stump for their precious socialist agendas."
They're lying filth and should be treated as such.
"Also, they cant fire you outside the contracted permissible reasons."
"Yes, they can.  They can fire you for any reason they see fit.  They could fire you because you bought a red car and they wanted to have the only red car in the parking lot.  It's <em>their</em> business, not yours."
They can fire you for any reason they see fit. 
"No, they cant. If we have a contract saying they can only fire me for driving a blue car and they fire me for driving a red car, they violated the contract and I can own them in court."
Or do you not believe in contract.
"Freedom of association is unalienable. There is no crime in terminating an association, therefore the only consequence in court would be any consideration not yet paid and any agreed upon amount for said termination. Even that could be unconscionable if it's too high."
Breaking a contract is a violation of the NAP
"If we have a contract saying they can only fire me for driving a blue car and they fire me for driving a red car, they violated the contract and I can own them in court."
"If that's literally the only clause in the contract, yes."
"Unfortunately for your example, that's not how literally any contract works.  Every contract says the employer can fire you for any reason, or even without a reason.  Which is the libertarian position."
"So yes, if you hypothetically had that hypothetical contract, then they couldn't fire you for driving a red car.  But no employer is ever going to make that contract with you, because it would be stupid of them and bad for their business."
"Every contract says the employer can fire you for any reason, or even without a reason"
"No, not every contract does."
"No, not every contract does. "
"Lol, is that the best objection you have?  You're quibbling over little minor details."
"Yes, 0.00001% of contracts don't have that.  Which is statistically negligible, so it's fine to call it zero.  If you want to try and hold onto that tiny little percentage and say I'm ""wrong,"" feel free.  But I'm not going to get into arguments about data points so small they don't even amount to a rounding error."
"Just writing things on paper doesn't make it legal. And, given the craziness of statutes, what is recognized as legal is often not libertarian."
unions are socialism
Yep there it is. The Panzer tankie talking point.
Employers deserve special treatment and unions should be handicapped. Totally Libertarian
State backed unions are completely anti-libertarian you twat.
"Great news for the indie game developers who won't be union shops. More of the work will move offshore, and the publishers will drop titles that aren't AAA rated and thus generating a profit."
"It won't happen. Games are a hit-driven business, and the best devs that all of the studios want aren't interested in unionizing."
"oooh , more unemployment"
"Great, communism strikes again."

"Although Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf recently declared that “[w]e won’t take gun away” from medical marijuana users, the Pennsylvania State Police (“PSP”) has not received the memo, as we have seen several instances where individuals who merely obtained a medical marijuana card – in the absence of actual use – have been denied by the PSP."
"Specifically, starting in at least early December, the PSP began placing individuals who are medical marijuana licensees into “undetermined status,” when they attempted to purchase a firearm. If the individual challenged the determination through a Pennsylvania Instant Check System Challenge, the PSP responds that the basis is that the individual is a “Current Medical Marijuana Card Holder.”"
"This obviously begs the question of how this information came into the possession of the PSP, since pursuant to Pennsylvania’s Medical Marijuana Act, 35 P.S. § 10231.101, et seq., and more specifically, 35 P.S. § 10231.302, all patient applicant information is confidential and not subject to disclosure. Furthermore, the implementing regulation relating to the confidentiality provision, 28 Pa. Code § 1141.22,  explicitly states that “[t]he name or other personal identifying information of a patient … who applies for or is issued an identification card” is confidential and “will not otherwise be released to a person unless pursuant to court order.” As the application is submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, only the Department of Health should have access to this information, absent a court order."
"As I am sure litigation will ensue, we just may find out, at some point, how the PSP obtained this confidential information."
"I live in PA and when I went to renew my CCW, they specifically asked if I had a medical card. It was not on my form."
"I’ve lived in Pittsburgh, PA my entire life and never have I witnessed such treachery than the combination of Peduto, Wolf, and Fetterman. Bandwagon democrats who are puppets of big name contractors and health insurance. Drain the swamp."
Don't forget the dickweasel AG Shapiro who recently banned the sale of 80% firearms in PA
"I knew the instant Wolf flipped and joined his henchman Fetterman in supporting marijuana that there was only one possible reason: they had run out of money to fund their schemes and thought it would be the easiest thing to tax the hell out of. I’m no Republican either. It disgusts me to see Wolf get re-elected term after term by the same Dems who want Bernie Sanders when Wolf is the epitome of the type of politician Sanders speaks out against! Putting a vote by party option on the ballot boxes was the moment real democracy died. Wolf isn’t even a Democrat, he’s just a parasite that’s sucked the blood out of PA for too long."
I mean it’s not like anybody was obeying that rule anyway lmao

For the same reason the pro-gun people spammed the sub with their anecdotal cases. 
"That's the thing about anecdotes, there are plenty for every position."
The kids violated the NAP so it was justified.
Disproportionate response.
"Well, he had a right to defend himself from attack. Good thing he, like a responsible gun owner, was ready to fire his gun from his moving car. Ready for the liberals to complain about ""kids getting shot"" Give me a break. You didn't see those kids. In winter jackets they looked like adults"
responsible gun owner
If you know who the shooter is you should let the Milwaukee Police department know.
If I knew who they were I wouldn’t tell the police simply because I like the idea of giving the police a bigger headache to deal with
"Wow. Next you'll be talking about how we need to register him too. I see the slippery slope and I'm not buying it. If you need the police to get involved every time someone shoots at a kid, then you're part of the problem."

This is not enough. This is only a limit on Trump specifically towards Iran. It should be for all presidents everywhere.
Yes take back it all.
<em>Laughs in McConnell</em>
"No. The President can keep it, while the Congress keeps cutting him checks. The system is working just as intended."
Agreed. Congress should take all of the war powers back. But I won't be disappointed to see us at least take a step in the right direction. 
We just have to keep fighting for the end goal.
"The billionaires don't want that, it is easier to buy one president versus buying a majority of senators."
The people should take war powers back. Boots on foreign soil should need a refferendum.
"I’m not so sure it is a step in the right direction. The statists still all believe in the power of the state. I had hoped that President Trump’s rash nature would cause some to begin wondering why so much power was in one person’s hands and start to pull some powers back. It’s clear, and this bill reinforces that with its limited nature, that they believe it’s just the wrong person this time. Maybe I’m wrong, I’d like to be, but unless the discussion on this bill goes in to limiting all Presidents, it will wind up with no change."
"Actually, if this keeps us out of a war, it will be a positive thing."
It's not a step in the right direction though. It only throws more fuel in the conspiracy fire that congress will do anything to hinder specifically Trump's ability to do his job for partisan purposes.
"Is it a conspiracy theory if it's true and obvious? Like obviously a good deal of what he does SHOULD be stopped, but as we can see here, democrats are trying to stop those things for the wrong reasons. There have been multiple times where dems have (correctly) called out Trump for abuse of power, but instead of fixing the problem, they just condemn him specifically because they themselves want to abuse the power when they get the opportunity. "
"You can hold the correct views (such as the president should not go to war in the ME without serious provocation) for the wrong reasons (because you don't like trump and these are easy political points). That doesn't make your views wrong, it just makes you solution wrong."
They want the power to stay because they can envision a scenario where POTUS learns of imminent danger and needs to act regarding a 9/11 type plot. They don't want a president killing a high ranking official after designating him a terrorist and risking war.
If your case is air tight enough that taking action would prevent a 9/11 then you should have to problem getting an ok from closed door committees. If it is time sensitive then there may need to be some prearranged things that are ok FOR A LIMITED TIME that don't need congressional approval (You obviously can't wait for congressional approval to respond to a nuke strike). Anything else is just fearmongering for more war and more military spending.
POTUS shouldn't have that say. That sounds like a job for the CIA to deal with. Civilians leadership always fucks up calls like that.
"The CIA would be the ones telling the President, but they would still need the President to order the attack/military action."
"And that decision needs to stay with the generals, the CIA or Congress."
The generals and CIA work for the President. It's their job to advise and the Presidents job to say go. Unless you're advocating for generals to just take action if they see fit?
"Yup, much easier to hold a general to account for their actions, and fewer of them are bought by special interest groups."
"Just like they wouldn't dare impeach Trump for his missile attacks against Syria without Congressional approval, troop occupation without Congressional approval, support for Saudi Arabia's genocidal war against Yemen, or open an investigation regarding whether Trump pressured the OPCW to falsify their report on chemical weapons in Douma, they don't want to potentially hinder their own authority at a future date."
"This, this, a thousand times this."
"The problem is that what Congress giveth, Congress can take away, just like they've already done."
"""We just need the <em>right</em> people in office."" - Every politician ever."
I'm glad the anti war left is at least waking after sleeping for 8 years during the Obama administration. Being anti war is cool again.
"While there is certainly a group that is truly anti-war, this proposal is specifically anti-trump war. Like literally just is ""trump you can't go to war with Iran."""
They are't going to take away powers their team might get to use in the future. Its' not like they are passing this law on principal.
"They wouldn't take it all back. We'd never feed their bank accounts if Congress had to come to an agreement on foreign warfare, easier to let one man lead us into it and blame him/her when it inevitably goes south."
"You are never going to convince those warmongers to do something like that without serious violence. Sure, this time it's not their buddies they will enrich with our blood but whatabout next time. Can't get rid of the president's ability to declare war, what if Biden wins the next ellection and his handlers want him to invade Russia?"
Don’t worry everyone!  Once this president is gone they will cede control back to the president!
"Honestly, I hope they do the opposite. Whether you like Trump or not, you cannot fight half a war, you need to go all in. Congress needs to pass an Enabling Act granting the President special powers to wage the war he and his generals deem necessary."
"You’re right, you can’t fight half a war.  How bout we not fight the war at all."
"Pacifism is submission to the winning side. In order to retain sovereignty, one must be willing to enforce peace and or neutrality. Consider the swiss as a case and point. Peace isn't cheap, and if you want to avoid war, you must be strong enough to enforce that position."
"""Enforce peace"""
...
"Ok I'll give you an example. Switzerland was neutral during the two world wars. This doesn't mean they were pacifists. Rather, they had the nerve and willingness to down both german and allied aircraft during the war. Similar policies could be found with other nations during the time. Being peaceful isn't free. If a nation is to avoid war, it must also ensure it cannot be pushed over and invaded on a whim."
"I'm not disagreeing with you. Sorry if it came off that way. Just left a bit perplexed by the complete, but accurate, oxymoron. "
"Obviously a firm defensive strategy is necessary in order to maintain sovereignty, but this requires great restraint and responsibility."
"I get the oxymoron, but it's ironically true. In the same sense the freedom isn't free, peace isn't always peaceful. If you don't want to get involved in a war, you must be prepared to defend that position by any and all means."
"Everyone must learn of our peaceful ways, by force!"
There is no need for war. And definitely not one he and his generals deem necessary.
"Lol, I thought you were serious until I saw your flair. Good trolling."
All hail the executive branch!

Prediction: they won't.
"<em>The Congress shall have Power . . . To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules conquering Captures on Land and Water;  “To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a</em> <strong><em>longer Term than two Years</em></strong><em>;</em> "
"Congress is nothing but a bunch of babbling do-nothing cowards that simply want to enrich themselves (<em>and they most certainly have done that</em>) by preserving the status-quo.  They long-ago relinquished most of their authority, responsibilities and decision-making to the Executive branch,  and to the vast administrative and foreign policy establishments and institoooshuns to which they are beholden to keep them in office."
Jackasses were happy letting Obama drone strike tribal leaders in every Muslim country we put a boot in. Trump gets a two for one deal and they want to re-write the book. Almost makes you want 4 more years to see what else will be undone out of spite.
This
are you too stupid to understand the difference between drone striking a random tribal leader and the second in command of a country of 80 million people we don't have a formal declaration of war against?
"regardless, the consistent libertarian position is to oppose both acts of aggression."
"but i guess ""triggering teh libs"" is more important to fake libertarians like you than being consistent."
Isn’t the president the commander in chief? Wouldn’t taking that power away from him just give more power to congress? Also aren’t there already limits such as not being able to have military operations lasting more than 60 days and not being able to declare war without approval?
"President is the commander in chief, i.e. he commands the army during war time. But the power to start a war in the first place belongs with Congress, or that's how it was supposed to be per the constitution. "
The idea being the president couldn't go on all these military campaigns with his army at will. They were trying to prevent a situation like ancient Rome where Caesars wages non stop war to boost their careers and legacy.
Sadly this won't go anywhere. Posturing and hot air.
Both D's and R's love the president being able to unilaterally pump pork into their local weapons factories.
I agree but they are gonna give it back the moment a demo is in office. All these pols suck
"I'd get behind this if it was permanent.  Sadly, it's just a political stunt to attempt to neuter Trump and only Trump."
attempt to neuter Trump and only Trump.
That's a step in the right direction.
"Hyper-partisan motivated bills are not a step in the right direction, no matter what side it comes from. Congress shouldn’t have the power to restrict specific presidents. They were elected, so the powers they have or don’t have by the law should equally affect all future presidents until the law changes and so on."
"No, we don't get to pick and choose which Presidents get to exercise certain powers.  Limit them all."
"It's hilarious how this is a problem now with Trump but no one outside of libertarians were calling out Obama for his secret war that wasn't approved by Congress. There is absolutely no consistency, outside of this very party, when it comes to criticizing politicians."
It's hilarious how this is a problem now with Trump but no one outside of libertarians were calling out Obama for his secret war that wasn't approved by Congress
Kucinich had a large following based almost entirely on this. Code Pink as well. There is a vocal chunk of the Democratic base that understands that this didn't end when Obama took office.
Your choice to ignore it doesn't make it non-existent.
"As a dem, it was problem for Obama as well. This country is supposed to have checks and balances for a reason . The amount of drone strikes under Obama was shameful, this president has only increased them."
Everyone was extremely vocal about Obama expanding into Syria
Were you just too young to hear about it or something?
Dont forget that a vocal contingent of neocons shamed him for not getting into Syria earlier. And he went so far as to go to Congress for approval.  Imagine that
"it was not everyone, it was your group of libertarians and those who were opposed to obama's team. those team players who are now supporting trumps potential war are hypocrites."
"No, many if not even most of the Democrats opposed it"
"Lol, down from ""Everyone"" to ""many... Democrats"" in just three hours."

"In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that only 22 percent of Republicans supported the U.S. launching missile strikes against Syria in response to Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons against civilians."
A new Post-ABC poll finds that 86 percent of Republicans support Donald Trump’s decision to launch strikes on Syria for the same reason. Only 11 percent are opposed.
"-- Overall, a bare 51 percent majority of U.S. adults support the president’s action in our new poll. In 2013, just 30 percent supported strikes. That swing is driven primarily by GOP partisans. For context, 37 percent of Democrats back Trump’s missile strikes. In 2013, 38 percent of Democrats supported Obama’s plan. That is well within the margin of error"
That's appreciated. 
"When you say ""everyone"" it makes people think you mean ""everyone."" "
"This is relevant during the time of a primary, when certainly some candidates did and did not support the drone strikes. Those who did not support them deserve to be recognized over those that did. Simply stating ""everyone"" was against them is a problem today."
"And while 30-40% of Democrats supported the drones, MANY more held their tongue to prevent harming the party. And those that did support the drones were disproportionately represented in the administration and party leadership, IMHO."

Well he never actually did that
Infact now there's even more troops in Syria exclusively for war crimes of protecting oil

That's beside the point, because at just the mention of removing troops from Syria, all the democrat (and republican, but I expect them to be pro-war) talking heads were telling us that we need to listen to the generals. Nevermind if we did, we'd never leave the Middle East."
"I mean his 'hints' if executed are the worst possible move to accomplish actually doing anything, and basically everyone knows he's always lying so they never actually believe him lol"
"He's suggested pulling everyone out of Syria. Even though he'll never do it, that's a great suggestion."
Obama suggested getting rid of guantanamo and Republicans absolutely lost their shit
Words are cheap lol
And? I don't understand what this has to do with me pointing out how politicians love the forever war in the Middle East.
Your initial issue with people throwing a fit over the 'hint' of trump leaving Syria
Substitute Guantanamo with Syria and Trump for Obama
Cool. So do you support the bill or not?
but no one outside of libertarians were calling out Obama for his secret war 
"Progressives and the far-left were also making the same criticisms, not that the establishment cared."
"There was still plenty on the left saying the same shit about Obama, sure we were called conspiracy nuts or racists but the call was out there. Jimmy Dore has been saying that shit since Bush."
"I still didn't agree with Obama's war powers then, just merely highlighting a step in the right direction, even if it's mostly partisan politics. "
"Even if it's only limited in scope, we should still applaud this move and push for congress to take back full war powers indefinitely."
I upvote every opinion I don’t like to support that persons freedom of speech
BREAKING NEWS: Virtue signalers want to virtue signal.
Baby steps. Put one foot in front of the other......
"Seems redundant, why don’t they just enforce the Constitution as written?"
"Oh...right, because then they’d have to march into the cell with Trump."
They could just revoke the war powers act and go back to declaring war.
"Technically the war powers act is supposed to be the check on the president. I say that because before that (so between WWII and the end of Viet Nam) presidents seemed to be able to declare war at will. War powers act is an abomination, but that is just because it is too lenient, not because it wasn't a good idea."
"It doesn't matter, Republicans won't pass it until November of 2020 and only if a Democrat wins the next election."
"Maybe that's exactly the answer.  Get the House to pass it while a Republican is in office, then as soon as a Democrat takes over, the Senate will immediately jump on it."
"I can't wait until the Republicans are suddenly concerned again about foreign entanglements.  Why, just in the last few weeks all the conservatives on reddit were all quite enamored of Trump's stated desire to get out of the Middle East, and celebrated pulling a few troops out of Syria as a win over the warmongering Democrats.  Fast forward to today and if you're not for invading Iran you're a traitor commie."
"Republicans don't actually believe in anything, its how Trump won the candidacy and Presidency. "
As long as you shit on Democrats every other sentence you can promise whatever and they'll vote for you.
Pretty much
This applies to Libertarians too though
"That doesn't make sense.  It's only specific to Trump and Iran. Oh, you didn't read the article.  Shocker."
Republicans don't support their president?
Oh wait you're a fucking moron lol
"Wow, you still didn't read the article did you?"
AKA Congress asks permission of the Executive Branch to do its intended check &amp; balance of national power
Remember when the Obama administration removed a sovereign government without Congressional approval? 
Remember when everyone was more concerned with the Benghazi Embassy catastrophe to be concerned with why that sovereign government was removed from power without Congressional approval. 
Remember when the Democrats said and nothing about it? Remember when the Republicans were only concerned about Benghazi?
Donald J. Trump is the Commander-In-Chief and the President of the United States.
Good. But sadly this is really the House and there's no way McConnell will let it see daylight in the Senate.
1) this will never pass. 2) if by some miracle it passes the House and Senate then it will get a veto. 3) less than no chance they override the veto
"Good, this needs to be a power limited to congress."
"Yet people laugh when you suggest debt slavery is a very real thing. Could you imagine waking up, putting on a uniform, lying to teenagers about joining war, and then tell yourself you live with any sort of honor. ""Tell me more about Semper Fi old wise one""."
Sounds like a win-win. No objection.
Not so much a win for all those brown people who are going to get killed so people can go to college
"Your tag has me curious, could you explain it?"
"Libertarians tend to fall into conflict over ideological issues related to property ownership, then call each other statists for supporting capitalist or socialist property structures. "
"The reality is that in a stateless society, these wouldn't necessarily be issues. So the conflict always seems to be left vs right but really it should be about limiting the state from impinging on human rights."
Thank you for the clarification.
Thoughts on this from a libertarian perspective?
Fuck the army
Fuck students that got a degree from borrowed money that they couldnt pay back too. From guaranteed student loans from the government. So really it comes back to the government
"Surely some of the blame should also be placed on the rent-seekers, the universities holding land, patents, and public research out of the public domain and charging students surplus prices for access to the commons above the value of any tangible education services they are actually providing?"
No it's all government!! The market is ALWAYS our friend.
"Yes. Government is the problem, never the solution."
"What about all those various real world nations that have found solutions to the very problems we face, and solved them through government."
"Why don't Libertarians ever offer how to really fix things, if government isn't the answer? In your views if government is evil then should schooling be only for those who can afford it?"
Government has solved no problems. Even good intentioned programs are funded through force. That is immoral. 
"The US used to have the best schools in the world. Then government took over and now we are way down on the list. You don’t need government for education. Private schools are only expensive now because of government. If there were no public schools, private school education would become MUCH more affordable due to incentive based market competition. You could also have schools funded through large charitable organizations. "
"Libertarians do offer solutions. Statists usually don’t like them or don’t understand them. The first thing one must realize that government is the most inefficient and immoral choice when it comes to solving problems. It has no incentive to do well. It isn’t accountable to anyone. If it wants more money it will just take it from you and if you resist you can end up in jail, or worse. "
To put it another way:
Any idea that has to use a threat of force for you to go along with it it’s a bad idea.
The first thing one must realize that government is the most inefficient and immoral choice when it comes to solving problems
Cite your sources?
Also what's immoral is making people choose between insurmountable medical debt or death when it comes to an illness all because they don't have insurance. That's immoral
Cite your sources?
History and modern times. 
Also what's immoral is making people choose between insurmountable medical debt or death when it comes to an illness all because they don't have insurance. That's immoral
"Which is why true market based solutions are the logical choice, which is what we most definitely don’t have in the US."
"What a compelling argument you make. I'm swayed, the free market clearly has been shown through the data you provided to be the best choice. /s"
That’s your problem here. It isn’t just about data. All one need do is look at where there are incentive based free markets with the least amount of regulation.
Consumer electronics is a good start. Based on what statists say that market should be run just by one big monopoly that makes everything in the consumer electronics world. 
In reality that isn’t the case. There are lots of manufacturers of various brands and costs are constantly coming down. This is good for the consumer.
LASIK eye surgery is another example. That is a procedure not covered by insurance. The quality of the surgery has gotten way better and because it isn’t covered by insurance it’s a cash only business. Because of that the cost of that surgery has dramatically come down over the years. 
The US used to have the best schools. Once the government took them over the schools in the US are outperformed by many other countries.
You wanna see how inefficient and not cost effective government is? The DMV. the VA hospitals. Medicare. Medicaid. Military costs. The Social Security administration. The list goes on. 
"The difference here is that when there is an incentive based market, like the ones I listed above, there is an incentive to offer a better product/service at a cheaper  price than the next guy. That sparks innovation and competition and that’s good for consumers."
Government has no such incentive. They are accountable to no one. Government doesn’t have to worry about how the bills are going to get paid. It can just tax you more if it needs money. There is no incentive to be more efficient or more cost effective. This is why government should be the last choice when it comes to finding solutions for things.
Libertarians do offer solutions. Statists usually don’t like them or don’t understand them. The first thing one must realize that government is the most inefficient and immoral choice when it comes to solving problems.
So... what's the solution.
Incentive based market solutions that offer more freedom are always the solution.
"Do you have an example in mind or did you basically say ""just trust the market"""
Im going to copy and past a comment I made to someone else that asked the same thing.

"The US never had this golden era where there was no government involvement in school <em>and</em> we had stellar educations for everyone. <em>Some</em> got a good education, <em>most</em> got none or almost none. If that's optimal for you, then remember that it's unlikely you'd be one of the lucky ones."
The free market will provide all and awnsers all
Fuck students that got a degree from borrowed money that they couldnt pay back too.
"Yeah they deserve to have their lives potentially destroyed by the military or at best lose years to a job they never wanted.  Who the fuck do these assholes think they are, kids trying to pursue their passions and receive an education?  Dumb cunts needs to learn the ways of the real world where some bad financial planning at 18 will fuck you life."
"I can't imagine having such contempt for other people, even if they made bad loan decisions the idea that we shouldn't fucking care that a military industrial complex feeds on them is absurd. Someone says fuck the Army that feeds on these people and your response is to blame the people for being vulnerable enough to be fed on? "
Where is your basic human empathy?
So you picked the first sentence and ignored that I blamed the government for the problem. Hey I'm sure you want more government to be the solution. The army is more government. There ya go. Big gov to the rescue.
"Reduce the number of people going into debt by: 1) giving citizen-residents reserve deposit accounts and introducing money into circulation by paying capped per-person interest on personal savings, rather than by giving it to the largest asset holders, 2) allowing student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy according to the same standards as other debts, 3) shift taxes to direct charges on patents of land and ideas to increase wages and savings, 4) apply direct land and patent taxes to universities even if they are considered 'non-profit'. Universities can't pass such fees on to students through tuition, exempting universities from such fees reduces competition."
That's a libertarian perspective?
allowing student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy according to the same standards as other debts
Standards with other debts under bankruptcy is you losing your collateral. How does that compare with education debt?
"Wait, have you never even heard of ""unsecured debt""?"
​
It's a thing.
"Good for the army. Doesn't justify the gov fucking higher ed prices all to hell, though. There is the matter of the perverse incentive to continue doing so, too."
"Currency offered in exchange for labor, more at 11!"
"I just don't understand the logic.  If you're a student, in debt or not, <em>you're a fucking student</em>  Use that access to academia to increase your earning potential and fuck the army."
"Seems like they'd be targeting highschool dropouts, or people with medical debt.  Targeting student debt seems counter-intuitive.  Yet it apparently works well enough."
Nothing wrong with a bit of army. It builds character.
"So... The same thing they've done for at least the last 14 years? I remember the constant recruiter presence in high school and college. I assume it was there longer, but I can only speak about 2005 onwards."
Yet we are not for universal healthcare? k.   
If your born too poor and get sick we should Let the market decide!
Libertarians are against anything that doesn't resemble a sweet blend of 1905 America and 1990 Somalia.
Our healthcare system as it stands is nowhere near a free market.
"Ohh yes. It's the govermemt forcing hospitals to charge $20,000 for a blood test and 700 for an epi pen"
Nearly half of all money spent on healthcare is provided by the federal government. The insurance industry is also heavily regulated and is being forced to take on individuals who will be an overall drain when in the past they would be able to deny them. 
We have already seen the government money issue in colleges. Once the government guarantees a certain amount of money per individual costs increase to meet that amount. Those same prices transfer over to the private sector since the individual knows that their insurance will pay for their unnecessary emergency room visits.
"""forced to take on individuals that would be a drain"".<br/>
That's my point. The free market let's people die in pain if they can't make a profit.  Then when the goverment ""forces"" them to treat they will do the minimum and leave the poor person in debt hell.   "
"Getting medical care is not a commodity, its a human right to treat people if we have the ability to as a society. Our model does not work. I'm Libertarian about most things but I have never understood how people continue to back our evil healthcare model."
I understand where you're coming from. Nationalize healthcare all you want. I wont stand in the way. 
It doesnt make sense for people with pre existing conditions to be covered by new health insurance policies. The government mandating that they would be is why my premiums have increased 300%.
Army has healthcare too. Paid by taxpayers.
"So in order to get my cancer treated without declaring bankruptcy or wrecking my credit, I should join the army?"
"Lowest unemployment in three generations.  I'd say most of the folks in the military right now want to be there, and are not there out of lack of any other option."
Lowest unemployment in three generations.
"Oh yeah, everyone should be grateful for unpaid intership, unpaid overtime, and at-will termination."
"Seriously, fuck off, calvinist shit. Low level of unemployment mean jack shit when jobs are so fucking soul-crushing and unfulfilling, a fucking military career comes of as a better option."
He's a Trumpist shill
Im in the military.... it is what i have always wanted to do. I am fufilled..... My soul is not crushed.... Did you mean to imply the military is a horriable option? Because my life is great.
"Funny, a military with reading comprehension problem."
Yea...my sense of fulfillment and self worth was always at its highest when I was unemployed.  Just imagine how crushed my soul was when I accepted that employment offer.
I agree.  All of the folks in the military wanted to be there. Those that are not wanting to be there can leave after thier contract ends.  There is no mandatory service requirement.
It’s a marketing tactic - If their stupid enough to go into ridiculous amounts of debt to be propagandised to with the end result being  a useless degree then they’re probably stupid enough to risk their lives for corporate interests.
"Demand is for products, which is driven by innovation and supported by a large class of consumers with disposable income.  Get rid of innovation and reasonably high wages that will allow consumers to spend on non necessities and you’ll tank demand."
It’s a system very subject to feedback loops.  When people do well the economy does well which provides higher paying jobs for people who then pump those wages back into the economy which provides better jobs.  
"But it also goes the other way, lower incomes leads to less demand which slows the economy, which leads to more lay offs and lower income, and then less demand, and more lay offs.  "
In the second case the government can try to reverse the trend by putting money in people’s pockets so they can spend it and stop the loop.  Some of governments methods of doing this are more effective than others.
"Few things. Earths population is about to see a massive downturn. More nations are industrialized. Chinas child policy is fucked beyond belief, and India growth is unsustainable."
"Second. Yes, government will likely grow to meet new demands. The era of limited government is gone. The poor have a voice. And it speaks. They no longer want the Bezos of the world to rule over them with cash."
"The demand for what?  Humans aren't a product.  If you look at humans as a means of production only and don't consider humans to have intrinsic value, what the hell is production for?  Do humans exist to serve businesses or do businesses exist to serve humans?"
"When business people treat all humans as though they exist only to either sell things to or to make things, they have a world view in which humans exist to serve businesses.  Is that the way you really want things to be?  Is that the way anyone wants it to be?  That was one of Marx's primary complaints about capitalism; it devalues human life significantly."
"Yeah governments are absolutely necessary. Resources are abundant to the world nations but not to the individuals. If governments don't force some wealth re-distribution the majority of that wealth gets collected by a few. Government is also required to prevent exploitation of the poor in the forms of monopolies etc. We already have universally beneficial social programs that redistribute wealth in the form of schools, healthcare, food, housing etc."
"Eventually yes in the far future the ideal government is some form of communism. Not communism like we know today, but in a future where resources are mined and goods are produced almost entirely through automation competition in certain industries will become pointless. As you said this will take many more decades to reach but a key thing to keep in mind as wealth increases birth rate decreases. All first world nations have steady or falling birthrates while technology and overall wealth continues to rise. Every progressive generation is considerably richer than the previous, at least in terms of the items they can afford."
Tl;dr Libertarians have been dead wrong since the early 1900s. As time passes and goods become cheaper the idea of a free market has fewer and fewer benefits vs just offering government control over certain industries.
"As someone who's personally witnessed the ""universally beneficial"" programs you point to for inspiration, I find your comment hysterical"
I have no idea where you live or what you're talking about.
Is that necessary? you said they were universally beneficial so od assume not. but my experience is in the US with DHHS and a variety of other programs. I assure you they're not beneficial to many they purport to help.
Clearly it does matter where you live because the United States is the nation that does <em>not</em> have social safety nets that most other European nations have.
Public Schools are universal in nearly every single nation and for good reason. Cut that down to private only and you will have many cases of kids going without schooling and growing up illiterate. Even in the US we had a huge illiteracy issue until public schooling started kicking in.
"Healthcare has been done a variety of ways in most western nation and, though not perfect, has been infinitely more successful than relying on private insurance."
Yes the US social services are kind of shit but there are real world models of how to improve them and what we have now is still leagues better than what we'd have if they were removed.
Clearly it does matter where you live because the United States is the nation that does <em>not</em> have social safety nets that most other European nations have.
We have a pretty wide safety net compared to most of the world and a lot of europe. My point is none ofbthose programs are universal and each one has failed people badly enough to kill them at there very worst. You're preaching a utopia not a real solution 
Public Schools are universal in nearly every single nation and for good reason. Cut that down to private only and you will have many cases of kids going without schooling and growing up illiterate. Even in the US we had a huge illiteracy issue until public schooling started kicking in.
"Public schools work fantastjcally in suburban and rural areas, theyve failed pretty spectacularly in urban environments where the people have less say in their local governments. But on the whole I'd agree public schools have benefitted the public, but thats way off from solvong the education problem like you seem to be implying."
"Healthcare has been done a variety of ways in most western nation and, though not perfect, has been infinitely more successful than relying on private insurance."
"Insurance, whether private or public is a shit way of handling healthcare. That said what we've has the last 50 years has been anything but a private system, its been relatovely dominated by government contractors or agencies long before the ACA."
Yes the US social services are kind of shit but there are real world models of how to improve them and what we have now is still leagues better than what we'd have if they were removed.
"I didn't say there weren't or that we should throw them out entirely, but you painted way too rosey of a picture of past experience with public services and made an excessively optimistic outlook on our ability to improve them. Becoming more efficient and taking over the entirety of all markets are two entirely different things, and the first is almost certainly more plausible"
"""We have robots now so let the government own them"". Jesus."
"You said it, man."
Supply meets demand at the market clearing price.
"And are there too many humans for the demand? When AI removes humans from the workforce more and more over the next century, would there be a proactive effort in preventing <em>more</em> humans from being created?"
"At some point, it will be cheaper to have a robot do whatever than a human."
"If demand decreases, the price decreases until the market clears."
Can that be extended to human biology?
I don't know what you're asking.
I guess I'm trying to say... is there a market supply/demand for reproduction? And should the government dictate how many kids you can or cannot have? There has been limits (China) and incentives (US) to children.
"But in a post-AI world, where a majority of humans are not working and the government has to feed the surplus or risk revolt, should there be a limit? Should there be punishment if you do have a child?"
"Wow, eugenics in 2020. What a time to be alive."
literally nothing about what OP said has anything to do with eugenics.
Overpopulation is a problem.  Acknowledging that problem has nothing to do with eugenics.
"We should do a Chinese style one child policy then. You know, because overpopulation is such a problem."
"whether that is a good idea or not, it's still absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with ""eugenics"""
Overpopulation is a myth.
Unnecessary poverty is caused by rent-seeking and privatization of the commons.
Overpopulation is a myth.
lolwut.
Overpopulation is a myth.
Evolution says otherwise.

Calm down dude.  You're hyperventilating.  There's no new war as of right now.
Try listening to the cast and not reacting to a title.
Correct. We've been in a cold war with Iran for the last 40 years
The assassination was an act of war against two countries.
6 hours after you wrote this Iran started hitting bases hosting US troops.
"Iran, or its proxies?  Their proxies have been hitting our troops since the beginning of the Iraq war often under the direction of Soleiman, so try 18 years before that post and youd be more accurate."
"No, Iran. Missiles from Iran. Iran is claiming them and warning other countries not to host US troops. This is a major escalation, you're just wrong on this one"
And somehow they haven't hit or manage to kill anyone with them.  Wonder why that is?  Perhaps a little bit of face saving?
"Yea we'll see, I've seen a bunch of conflicting reports"
"<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/eljuv0/iranian_retaliatory_strikes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/eljuv0/iranian_retaliatory_strikes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a>"
And have yet to hit anything or kill anyone.  Iran has a habit of this type of bluster.  They don't like to get their hands dirty directly.
War Hawks? Where did anyone explicitly say “I want a war with Iran?”
Edit: If you can’t answer the question then upvotes and downvoted are meaningless.
"I tend to weigh actions more heavily than words, and his actions are more than hawkish"
Go ahead. “Orange man bad” is a topic frequently on this subreddit. That wasn’t what I was inquiring though. 
This is the war that hawks have been praying for....
Who are these hawks? Where are they saying they want war? Why did you downvote my question?
"and if you think they are something less than human, you are more likely to engage in violence against them"
"Exacrly why we need to dehumanize our enemies, you cant have your followers feel symphany, it gets in the way"
"Yes, examples are slavery, holocaust, genocide and abortion."
"I mean whether or not you believe it's a woman's choice whether or not she terminates the fetus doesn't change the fact that it's fucking got different DNA from her and is therefore not ""just a growth""."
Cancer cells have different dna. Thats pretty much the reason behind most growths.
"I guess that if you wanted to be needlessly obtuse you can liken a zygote to a cancerous growth, but surely you understand that a cancerous growth doesn't have the potential to grow into a sentient organism."
You’re the one who put forth “has different dna” as a test of moral standing. My intention was to show how stupid that is and I think you’ve proved my point. An egg isn’t a chicken and a zygote aint a person.
"Yes. It is. Whether or not you want to argue about if nature or nurture makes the most impact on a person's personality, you can't argue that DNA doesn't influence how the body of a human forms."
"Why do you keep harping on dna? Of course a zygote is fundamentally the same type of animal as a fully grown human. Our disagreement stems from what a human must have to gain moral standing. No matter how you want to frame either of our arguments, its opinion."
"I believe that the fact that dna and epigenetics is determined at conception and shortly after, that any termination of it is a loss of a potentially important mind. It's like taking a diamond and then grinding it up into tiny little pieces in my opinion."
EDIT: wrong word
abortion
Abortion is on the same level as the fucking Holocaust lmaooooo
Let me ask you a question:
"Do you believe in the NAP, and are aware of the law of non contradiction and the principle of consistency?"
Many people who believe in the NAP also believe in legal abortion on the principle of bodily autonomy.
"Some Jews are Nazis. They are just as retarded as other Nazis, if not more."
Do you believe life begins at conception or sentience?
Conception..... now please answer my question
"Ok so if I say it begins at sentience, we are at an impasse."
"NAP is fine in a vacuum, those other “laws” are weird to ask me to believe in. I feel like you’re setting me up for some “redditor OWNED with FACTS and LOGIC” so I’ll play along and wait for your slam dunk."
"Go ahead, Michael Jordan."
Very aggressive for a online discussion lol....... didn’t really expect that on this sub.
Anyways:
"You have a right to life. One may not take a life from another without proper justification. Your right to life comes with a corresponding obligation to respect the right to life of others. All rights have corresponding obligations. If animals had rights they would have a corresponding obligation to respect the rights of others. Lions for example do not respect the right to life of a zebra, cats do not respect the right to life of a mouse. They are animals being animals. They are not braking the NAP. Animals should not have to be taken to court and testify for breaking the NAP. Animals lack the capacity for moral reasoning. Animals can’t be expected to understand or obey the NAP and therefore do not have rights."
"To argue that animals have rights, but not corresponding ones would be a violation of the law of non contradiction and the principle of consistency"
From this we see that personhood is tied to the capacity of moral reasoning which is what separates humans from animals 
"Is a being a person from natural capacity of moral reasoning, or current capacity or moral reasoning:"
Natural capacity: The capacity inherent to any type of being 
Current capacity: the ability to immediately exercise a natural capacity 
"A human infant lacks the current capacity to walk, but it does posses the natural capacity to do so. As it matures it will have the ability to do so"
Even if it had a handicap that prevented it from ever being able to walk we still realize that humans are the type of beings to have to natural capacity to walk
"This is why it’s a tragedy when humans are not able to walk, but not a trashy when fish aren’t able to walk. This is because fish lack to natural and current capacity to do so"
"If personhood is grounded in a human beings natural capacity, then a human being is a person as soon as they begin to exist, which is at the moment of conception "
Therefor those who argue unborn children are not human persons must be arguing that personhood is grounded in a current capacity
"Someone arguing that a fetus is not a person until it is sentient is arguing for current capacity, not natural. However all animals are sentient therefore you must agree that all animals have rights and that all animals are persons. You don’t get to say a fetus is a person based off sentience, but animals aren’t. This is a violation of the principle of consistency"
Even if you argue sentience isn’t what makes a human being a person you will still run into contradictions and non consistency
Another example would be a person in a car crash who got taken to a hospital and required around the clock help and medical attention 
Suppose the doctor states the patient will require 9 months of treatment to become conscious again
While in natural capacity he will still obtain all his rights including life
You arguing from current capacity then means that the person would have no more current capacity then a fetus
Is it now morally permissible to be able to actively kill this person now?
"You now need to give me a consistent argument as to why it would be wrong to kill this person, but not the unborn child"
I like this argument.
"It wasn’t aggressive, it was a lighthearted comment on your demeanor."
You can’t kill that which isn’t living. Life isn’t defined by number of cells. Is masturbating a violation of the NAP? That’s half of a human being right there if two cells are the minimum requirement for life.
"So a mother is solely responsible for the health of her zygote and any act she does that negatively affects it is a violation of the NAP, right? Does that mean that accidentally tripping is manslaughter? Or consuming too much fish? I’m actually curious because at what point do you separate what the woman does from the effects on the child."
"Out of curiosity, is it morally OK for humans to kill and eat animals? Animals have more sentience than a 1 week old zygote. Is it ok to kill and eat them (outside of survival conditions)?"
"What about aborting to save the life of the mother? According to the NAP, I can’t kill someone to save my own life. Is aborting in that case ok? What about rape babies?"
"I’ll try and respond more, currently at work and can’t get into a longer comment."
Nice try.  Fetuses aren't people.
The official libertarian stance on abortion is pro choice.  Are you lost?
"The libertarian mantra has for years been, ""do what you want, as long as you're not hurting somebody else"".  People disagree on how to categorize a fetus, as to whether it counts as somebody else. "
"Plus, appealing to, ""the official libertarian stance"" as an authority to shut down a person for their political opinion is hilariously anti-libertarian."
"That's the official stance of the libertarian party.  You can disagree with it while still being a libertarian.  Just like you can be a libertarian who believes in socialized healthcare, or a libertarian who believes in universal income, or a libertarian who believes in gun control.  All of that is allowed."
"It just seems odd to me that someone would come to the libertarian subreddit and try to sell any of those ideas.  So I asked if they were lost.  Maybe I was being a little cheeky, but certainly less cheeky than trying to slip abortion in alongside genocide."
"Naw, he's just non human."
It's beautiful. I have it on a pillow.
"Friendly reminder that Trump bombed a civilian airport in <em>Baghdad</em>. We bombed ourselves, because we were so terrified of an Iranian general visiting his Iraqi counterpart."
"We've completely lost control and we're just butchering anyone who scares us, over there."
And we’ve lost support of the government we’ve propped up and will soon either be forced to leave their sovereign territory or use force against their government again to keep the bases.
So what you're saying is we will need to buy more bombs and continue perpetual war?

"""russian bot"""
"""russian asset"""
"""white nationalist"""
"""racist"""
Its been fun to see the Left lose their minds the last couple years and turn propagandist like the Right was doing under Obama. 
"""white supremacist"""
When was the last time Left wing terrorists killed people in the US ? Now same question for the Right ... then ask yourself who doesn t view the other as human.
I think it's getting to the point where both sides view eachother as subhuman. At least that's the vibe I get off reddit.
"Oh the ""both sides "" thingy again... 109 deaths in the US from right wing terrorist attacks  since 9/11 (for the record even islamist terrorist are at 106 deaths in the US . Now guess how many people did Left wing terrorists kill ? 0 . But fox news will tell you how much you should be scared of antifa but respect the freedom of speech of white supremacists."
"""You stole a car ,i killed 2 dozen people we re pretty much the same ."""
"""look, despite my side attempting multiple times to kill people, it just sucks at actually getting the killing part down. So you should let us continue with what we're doing."""
"Dayum that s some next level mental gymnastics in order to play the ""both sides"" card . You know the 109 dead people would have loved if the right win terrorists who killed them stopped at the ""attempt"" part ."
"Are you mad at antifa and co because they don t succeed at killing people now ?   Dayum you must be cheering for the winning team so hard  ""go kkk go !!!"""
"""you literally are only allowed to hate one side at a time."" Don't let the thinking hurt you too hard."
"Dude at this point you re just becoming pathetic ... you tried to play the ""both sides"" card ...you got smacked with some facts . You didnt find a good comeback to the 107 deaths from right wing terror attacks to the 0 of left wing terror attacks so you went into the craziness of ""yeah but you see they tried so it s the same ""."
You dug yourself into a hole and now you re too embarrassed to admit you were wrong so you just keep digging .
"I’m free to hate Antifa all I want because they barely actually target nazis and when they do, they get beat up with ease, effectively making them violent thugs to anyone that isn’t a nazi. You can keep pointing to a death count of people under heavily skewed definitions of “right wing terror”, none of that changes the fact that antifa has done nothing to stop nazis and has spent more time being belligerent towards common people. But don’t worry sweaty, keep gargling <a href=""/r/enlightenedcentrism"">/r/enlightenedcentrism</a> up and tell yourself antifa is the real hero. I’ll just wait for the next article of them getting punched retarded and go “I’m so glad this is the vanguard defending minorities.”"
"Care to point out where i claimed ""antifa is the real hero"" ?"
"So i get it you are free to hate Antifa ...i m not blaming you for that or calling you out or anything am i ? 
I m just curious to know how you feel about right-wing extremists."
"That has very little to do with reddit discourse, which is completely uncivilized, I'm sure you'd agree."
"He re is the thing ...a leftists talking shit to me is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy less likely to stab or shoot me than a ""conservative"" who i happen to disagree with ."
How many times have you been stabbed or shot by a conservative? I think you're conflating people who want small government and actual white nationalists.
"Ok i ll re-frame it ...if i engage into a debate with a ""liberal"" that said liberal may be an extremist and he may be antifa or something else ... so that liberal you may or may not be an extremist ( because you may not know those things at first ) is waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy less likely to stab or shoot me because we disagree than a conservative if said conservative happens to be an extremist ."
How many conservatives have stabbed or shot someone that they were simply debating with?  You sound like someone who has been brainwashed by propaganda.
"In individual cases there is usually debate whether it was mental illness or terrorism or regular old murder.  And there is debate over who is right wing or left wing or maybe neither.  Few of the cases involved any formal organization, most often a single person.  In any case there have been more than zero people killed by left wing terrorists, though fewer than right wing.  The ADL put's the number of extremists killings at 3% for left wingers and 73% for right wingers between 2009-2018 in the United States."
"what about african americans who almost always vote democrat who are responsible for the most amount of murder out of everyone? oh, let me guess, ""poverty"" is the problem there."
Holly hell ...are you seriously equating the black community to a terror group ? I mean holy shit when i think you people reached the bottom you always manage to go even lower . This isnt mental gymnastic at this point ...this is molecular rearrangement .
[deleted]
"Terrorist : a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. "
Now if you want to rewrite the English language that s on you .
So unless you are saying black people commit violence in pursuit of political aims then you are off topic . How you feel about it doesn't change facts .
""" sorry but people on the Left do more killing "" what is that even supposed to mean ? moving the goalpost into the stratosphere are we ?"
Google Antifa. The definition of fascists despite their name.
Edit: Also read about what happened to Andy Ngo.
109 deaths in the US since 9/11 from Right wing terror attacks ...now tell me how many people did antifa kill ?
Source?

​
Come on just a simple google search and you ll find dozens of articles covering the topic ...or were you never interested in the issue ?
just interested in your source of propaganda tbh
What is that supposed to mean ? That right wing terrorist attacks didnt kill 107 people since 9/11 ?
say it again lol
"Well you asked for a source , i gave you one ... and then you start rambling about ""source of propaganda""  so i m just telling you to stop running circles and own your shit . Is that number fake ? What is it ? Get to the point ."
How many have been killed by antifa? How many by right wing extremists?
That’s the argument you’re going to make? That the morality of a political side is represented by the actions of their respective fringe terror groups? That you can determine which side is better or worse by the amount of violence or murder one has committed? 
"Let me remind you that the topic was the effect that propaganda has on people’s minds, making them believe another side is sub-human. You are essentially arguing that right-wing terror groups are less human than left-wing terror groups. You are the exact example of someone negatively influenced by propaganda. Deaths and violent acts have been committed from both aisles by misguided and evil individuals taking their ideologies too far. "
Andy Ngo undeservedly suffered brain damage because of Antifa. Domestic left-wing terrorists have targeted and attacked ICE officers. There is a slew of examples of the terrible things any domestic terror group has done. You are a fool to think one is better than the other.
Edit: That goes for all you who think so.
"If someone steals a candy bar and another steals a car, they are different classes of criminals."
"You’re trying so hard to run this “both sides” narrative but it’s so flimsy if you had any semblance of objectivity. Antifa is annoying and occasionally unjustly physically assaults people, but they’re nowhere near mass shootings."
"<a href=""https://kprcradio.iheart.com/featured/the-pursuit-of-happiness/content/2019-07-15-antifa-radical-attacks-ice-facility-gets-shot-by-police/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kprcradio.iheart.com/featured/the-pursuit-of-happiness/content/2019-07-15-antifa-radical-attacks-ice-facility-gets-shot-by-police/</a>"
"So giving someone a brain hemorrhage and attempting to kill ICE officers is on a totally different lane from any other terror group? Sure man. Go ahead and believe whatever your echo chamber tells you. It’s not like journalists and police are human, anyway. "
Here’s a highlight:
"The man succeeded in setting one car on fire before officers responded at 4 a.m. and gunned him down, according to the Tacoma Police Department. The man was armed with a rifle and wore a satchel with flares, the police said."
"He attempted to burn down an immigration center, which routinely uses unjust coercion to violate US citizens rights. How is that even remotely similar to mass shootings?"
"Again I say, you’re really bad at this “both sides” shit."
"Libertarians are supposed to be against coercive states and institutions, not supporting them."
"“Yes, let’s just burn this place I don’t like real quick and shoot anyone, with my handy-dandy rifle, that gets in my way!”"
“That’s a libertarian!”
“That doesn’t violate the NAP at all!” 
"If you support domestic terror of any flavor, you’re not a libertarian. That’s not even a typical controversial statement."
“Person guns down unarmed innocent civilians” vs “Person attempts to burn down government structure”
What planet are you on that these are the same to you?
How many have been killed by antifa? How many by right wing extremists?
That’s the argument you’re going to make? That the morality of a political side is represented by the actions of their respective fringe terror groups? That you can determine which side is better or worse by the amount of violence or murder one has committed?

"This was my reply the first time you made that exact same post. Feel free to ignore it again, unless you just missed it."
Antifa: throws punches at alleged fascists. Has a habit of classifying conservatives as fascists.
Far right terrorism: literal mass shootings and attempted bombings
"Are you fucking stupid? Andy Ngo had milkshakes thrown at him and he was kicked and punched. ALSO he wasn’t a victimless bystander, he has a history of stoking this kind of shit. How is that even remotely similar to mass shootings?"
When was the last time Left wing terrorists killed people in the US ?
"June 14 3017 James T. Hodgkinson open fire on the Republican Congressional Baseball team, injuring Rep Scallise."
"August 4 2019 Connner Bett, the Daytona Shooter."
I stand corrected one managed to pull out a deadly shooting .

(It should be obvious but I’ll put it here: /s)
<em>cough</em> abortion <em>cough</em>
Isn't propaganda any idea that government tries to promote that only benefits the government? I think that the vast majority of modern propaganda is non-racial or prejudice. It main draws attention to non important government programs trying to make everyone believe that x program is in fact essential for citizens.
I’m sorry but communist are not people
well youre propagandist and frankly repugnant
It’s an ideology that has led to 50 million deaths and should t be taken seriously ever.
Straw man; most modern communists aren’t tankies. Besides you think that capitalism hasn’t led to millions of deaths? It simply isn’t examined like other ideologies because it happens to be the dominant one currently.
Not from starving
"Number one is to over throw the government if it becomes a tyranny. That's why there have been so many restrictions placed on weapons too. Politicians like to pretend it's to save the children, but criminals still get illegal weapons. "
Number two is protection from criminals.
"I am not disagreeing at all here, kind of just playing devil's advocate."
Do you actually think the US would ever become tyrannical? My thought process is that congress etc. have so many people involved that it would take a very large concerted effort in order to do something like that.
"Yes, but not in a way we'll see coming. Honestly I think it starts with current mind set of we deserve everything and government should pay for it. Once we rely on the government for everything they can do whatever they want."
"I agree, this is why I don't associate with the Libertarian Left, I think a lot of them mean well with the powers that they want to give to the government but don't understand what the government will then do with those powers."
Agreed
"The govt is already doing things that warrant intervention but because they aren't happening to you, it's not a big deal."
"For example, Japanese internment camps.  It happened and nobody did anything about it."
It's obvious that guns are only for yourself and not for any sort of armed insurrection
The intern camps are a black eye for the US. What is happening today that we should rise up for? At the time of intern camps we had bigger problems. As bad as the camps where. Our government is good at taking away what they can without pushing it too far for the times.
"It already has in the past, under temporary wartime measures. Fortunately, each time the government gave up this power afterwards, probably due to political pressure. The Patriot Act is the most recent example, and while it isn't anywhere near as tyrannical as prior instances, it has far outlasted the original purpose."
U have to get a license to own a tv in ur country. And u can go to jail for wrong speech. Idk what being right libertarian is in such a statist hell hole such as where ur from but freedom in america means the ability to protect myself and my family. Police will take minutes to get to my home when seconds are all that i have from a home invader. Every country that takes to much power through out of all history (see russia and china which are way bigger than the US is) eventually kills all their political dissidents.
"Things like what you just listed; hate speech, the BBC, etc. are things that are more important to the Libertarian Right in the UK at the moment, the issue is that the Conservative party has a huge monopoly over the entire right-wing vote so we often have to rely on pushing these issues through them."
Boris Johnson wants to get rid of TV licenses which is a good step for us I guess.
"Its absolutely possible.  Its done through incrementalism and false compromise.  Democrats in the US will start with a overreaching ban, lets say a ban on all semi automatic rifles.  Now this would include the super dooper scary ar 15, but it would also include a lot of common hunting rifles.  Now naturally the Democrats will get a significant amount of push-back so they'll retreat a little bit and propose some type of compromise where they effectively say ""Okay, fine we won't ban semi-auto rifles, but lets compromise and just ban rifles that can accept a magazine of more than 10 rounds.""  10 years later, after enough time has passed, they'll be back with another ban to say, ""Well 10 rounds is still to many, let's make that just 5 rounds.""  This will continue incrementally until one can't go to a gun store and purchase a firearm anymore."
"This is why many of us gun owners are the ""Not one inch"" type of folks because we see the incrementalism and when given an inch the democrats will attempt to take a mile.  They'll just do it one inch at a time.  Thus, there is no more room for compromise on our end."
"Part of the right libertarian (and communist) ideology is that that state is a form of oppression. This is due in part to their monopoly on violence. An armed populace is a way of keeping the government in check, in theory at least. (Marx says that ""Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered"" and there is obviously the 2nd ammendment of the US for the right wing perspective) One problem is that people who love guns often also support the police and military of the nation they live in meaning that they would never go against the government but that's by the by."
"The point is that it is necessary for the people to have more power than the government (Mao says that ""Political power grows from the barrel of a gun"") in order to stop dictatorship etc."
Liberals and conservatives will tell you that this is pointless because the government will always overpower the people but this is simply a lie. (The US revolution where the colonies beat a far better armed British army or the Vietcong beating the US).
"Edit: By far the main reason is the 2nd ammendment, this is a big deal because the US was born out of revolution. It does not resonate so well with us brits because we cannot imagine revolution, our society was born out of feudalism giving up some power through parliament. Not by the government being overthrown and our country being created overnight."
"This makes a lot of sense, like i.e. if the US were actually land invaded it would never be able to be defeated really as the US population, armed as it is, would never stop fighting."
Yeah basically and armed populace is incredibly powerful because it is strategically not what military powers expect. The edit was because I wasn't sure I'd answered your question as best I could.
"Except USA can never be invaded, UK with a mere channel has been able to defend itself quite well. USA is protected by two massive oceans from east and west. From the North, we have a long standing ally of Canada and to the south we have Mexico who is also a long standing ally. I think 100 years ago during WW1 Germany tried to get Mexico to fight USA, they were told to fuck off back then, doubt the response would be any different today. "
"As for the whole ""tyranny"" aspect:"
It is far more likely that USA's easy access to guns will lead to radicals and extremists arming themselves and using their armed militias to get their shitty agendas pushed forward. 
"And it is not just likely but has historically happened multiple times, that when government tyranny happens, most gun owners are the first ones to cheer. Trump's authoritarian actions are very popular among the very people who arm themselves in the name of protecting themselves from tyranny."
That's one of the big misunderstandings though isnt it.
"""If the US wont become tyrannical why do you need guns"""
"""The guns are what stops it from being tyrannical"""
and around and around again.
"That's actually pretty easy to stop right now, just take a look at your country where they arrest you for Facebook posts, or HK where China being oppressive again. Just say that on the second go and make the other person defend why Facebook arrests are necessary, it'll make them look stupid. "
"And since the other guy is saying the second amendment is the reason, it's not, the second amendment is the how, the protection provided to the right to bear arms, it is not why they are needed. Tyrants are why they are needed. Then if someone calls you a nazi, point out that a month before the beginning of the holocaust (night of broken glass) the nazis confiscated all the guns from the Jews that they could using a registry set up by the previous government."
"Now for being uninvadable, people forget that one of the major considerations there IS the number of armed and willing citizens. And finally, one can like and appreciate the military and police as individuals, but be very much willing to fight them as entities of the government."
You are clearly someone who has not grown up in a place where authoritarianism is accepted. I had people defend facebook arrests. Should we give those people access to guns?
"Yep, give everyone access. Remember, they defend it because they are afraid. They will not personally come out and do it so there's no reason to take them into account"
"Hahaha, no. They will personally come out and fight for the tyrannical government because they support what it does. You assume that tyranny is not what people want. Tyranny is not what people want for themselves. They get really excited for it when it happens to others. They are too stupid to realize that it will backfire in the long run but you cannot help stupid."
Just look at how much the gun owners are fellating Trump despite him screwing them over more than any recent president.
"Then you fight them. If you aren't willing to fight for your freedom, it is already lost"
"Yeah, just like black people tried to fight against an unfair lynching:"
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot</a>"
Great sounding platitudes and guns do not do much when you are outnumbered 10:1.
I just get annoyed with the following:
"""We need guns to protect us from people with guns"" is a damned circular logic. We are one people, we are not under threat of foreign invasion, let us just sit down and figure out why so many people need a gun to defend themselves."
"I have no issue with farmers and people living in isolated communities having guns. It only makes sense for them to own arms to protect themselves and their property. However, as someone who lives in a city, my neighbor having a gun is very much a risk to me. Because the idiot might shoot me by accident and there is nothing I can do about it. Plus in cities nobody is breaking into your place while you are there. They will just wait while you are on vacation or at work."
Edit:
"And we have plenty of cases of countries with armed populations being tyrannical and countries with disarmed population being democratic. Tyranny has to have the support of the people, and if the population is armed, even better because you can get people to kill each other while you sit back and laugh at the peasants doing the work for you."
"Self defense is a human right. My 80 year old mother can defend herself from a 200 pound methed out convict with a handgun. There is a saying here in the states "" God created man, Sam Colt made them equal ""."
"I honestly don't, but why does the government feel like they can take them away?"
"Yes, that’s the point. I shouldn’t need to justify why I want to do/own anything, as long as I’m not infringing the rights of others. I might want to own a gun because I like things that start with the letter G, my reasons are for me alone and don’t require anyone else’s approval."
"At this point,  the brit's are frogs being boiled slowly, so they don't feel the heat of tyranny that is growing in their country, so they are not very good at knowing what liberty looks like these days."
"But, I would say why don't you go ASK the people of Hong Kong who are trying to not have their liberty destroyed by the communist dictatorship in China this question.  "
I think you might find an answer there.
I've followed the stuff in Hong Kong quite a bit and always wondered how it would have gone if they were armed like the US.
"Also, with regards to the last UK election, the reason it was so fucked is because we basically had a choice between the Conservatives and their growing authoritarianism and a literally self-identified communist."
"The problem is that Hong Kong is literally an island smaller than Houston, Texas.  Its one of the few times that I think having guns to fight the military would be a blood bath, because there's literally nowhere for the HK'ers to retreat to.  That's the strength of an insurgency is its ability to melt away and blend in with the population and live to fight another day."
Follow that up with the fact that very few of them have any experience with firearms and it would be a bad day for them.
You guys have been ruled for so long I don't know if there is hope....
God save the queen my dude.
"Which one do you want to pick for defending yourself against an intruder in your house? The gun on the cop's hip 15 minutes away, or the one on your nightstand?"
"I mean, even our police officers don't have guns most of the time. You only really find armed one's in London and at some other government buildings."
"Not to say guns are not available to the police, just that you rarely see them."
"Then I'd say the fundamental difference is the extent and presence of guns in society in the first place. Alas, the Second Amendment creates a 'cold, dead hands' line for about 10 percent of gun owners in the US. Maybe more. [Edit: typos.]"
Because they're better than knives.
"A little off topic, but, with London's current issue with knife crime, I have wondered how something like concealed carry would affect it."
I think it would scare the shit out of the gangster-lite's that roam the streets at the moment.
"As you may or may not know, a primary issue with guns in America is the Second Amendment of our constitution - the right to keep and bear arms. In America, constitutional amendments are virtually impossible to change, meaning that no matter how one might feel about guns, here in America, millions of gun owners will always exist. This is something that needs to be considered when passing any additional gun control or gun rights legislation. There’s no getting around the millions of guns in America. "
"The original purpose of the second amendment was to prevent the US government from creating a standing army. Everyone knows that every country must be able to defend itself against external aggression. In history, this was always done through the government creating a standing army. But the founders of America had a different idea: if the citizenry owned their own guns, then there would be no need for a standing army (the theory being that the government is corrupt and will always mess things up). Obviously, this did not quite work out. However..."
"The theory behind the second amendment is still valid. Every citizen of a country needs protection from external aggression or violence. There are two ways to do that: the government or the individual. With guns, the individual is able to defend oneself against external aggression and violence, obviating the need for government intervention. No true gun rights person believes that they would ever be able to fight off any government. That’s not the point of the Second Amendment. The point is that gun ownership allows people to take care of themselves, rather than the government doing it for them."
"When guns are outlawed, then only criminals carry guns. Who in the world would want a society where only criminals carry instruments of death and destruction?"
Hope this helps.
"I have limited knowledge of the second amendment, I will openly admit. What I do know of it is just small bits from watching gun videos on YouTube so not the most informational as much as it is entertainment."
"This is interesting to understand though. In the UK, being an island nation, we generally have very little issue with illegal firearms as they are more difficult to get into the UK. This isn't to say there are none, there have been shootings in London as of recently. But the UK populace seems to generally agree that it really isn't a big issue."
"You could get into case studies and all kinds of interpretations, but there’s really not much to know as the amendment is only one sentence:"
"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."
"True, but many believe that the first phrase is no longer relevant, since the US has had a standing army for over a 100 years. Many don’t understand the original purpose of the phrase - to enable citizens to defend themselves, rather than depending on an ultimately corrupt government."
Another perspective: a bad person has multiple options for spreading death and destruction. But a single pistol in the right hands makes it a lot easier to stop that person.
"Our founders made it pretty easy to understand, although there are non-stop arguments made about the clauses in the Amendment."
"A well regulated Militia,  being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people  to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. "
"Now, to the anti-gun crowd, they like to focus on the 1st clause.  ""A well regulated militia""  This is a prefatory clause.  Almost like an adjective for a noun.  If I were to say ""The brown dog is fast"" I could also say ""The dog is fast"" and you would get the exact same meaning out of it.  The brown part is just a descriptive flourish, much like the ""well regulated militia"" clause in the 2nd amendment."
"The operative or the one that derives the meaning is ""the right of the people  to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"""
"You get a lot of folks on the gun side who'll automatically jump to the ""shall not be infringed"" part, usually typed in all capitals on reddit or other forms of digital communication.  However you have to look at the whats preceding that.  ""<strong>The right of the people to keep and bear arms,</strong> shall not be infringed.""  It does not refer back to the militia.  It specifically identifies the right to bear arms as the people's right."
"I don't have them for government reasons. I have them because I live in the country. So far I've killed 4 coyotes killing my chickens, a raccoon killing my chickens, ducks and a rabbit, one deer that had clearly been in the ditch for days, alive, while the coyotes at night and ate off of it's ass (I can't imagine that pain), a baby deer that another motorist had just hit (it was paralyzed but still very much alive) and a raccoon that I am pretty positive had contracted k9 distemper but I didn't call it in to get tested so it may have had something else but it definitely was sick. I've also ran off one guy that was kind of stalking me."
"It’s really not that simple of an issue although I’m sure from a global perspective the reputation Americans have for gun ownership would make it seem the general opinion. There are plenty of Americans who don’t carry or own guns, there are plenty that support regulations (though they never can seem to more specific than the blanket term “gun control”) and there are some that think the 2nd amendment should be repealed and all guns confiscated. The issue of guns, like others, is really part of a growing tension between city and rural dwellers with suburbanites being split. The rural lifestyle that has an emphasis on labor, working the land/the outdoors, self sufficiency, and personal independence has always been a strong part of the American identity and the Constitution is designed to protect it as a minority role critical to agriculture. "
"The argument that originally supported the amendment which was to overthrow a tyrannical government has become increasingly moot with the advent of explosives, vehicles, nuclear weapons, etc. Any American who owns guns and defends it saying they’ll fight the government with them is living in a pipe dream fueled by Jason Bourne movies and Busch Lite. Most gun owners in America would say its for personal and home defense."
"To me personally it’s about the Constitution. It’s an Amendment in the Bill of Rights listed alongside free speech, voting, and privacy. There is due process laid out on how to repeal amendments that while talked about by some far left legislators has never actually gained momentum. Instead it sits in between with regulation which I find disturbing because it is a right - think about regulating the rights it’s listed with. I believe maintaining the formal written agreement between the people and their government to be paramount to its functionality. It’s less about guns to me and more about the Bill of Rights losing its definition and becoming something malleable. That is a dangerously slippery slope."

"We've been fighting a bunch of goat herders wearing mismatching sandals with all these high tech explosives and weapons for pretty much my entire adult life, and we still haven't been able to put an end to that war.  Our military is built to fight other militaries, not an insurgency."
We haven’t been able to win those wars out of concern for killing civilians and the public opinion of the military. Our military is certainly capable of crushing an insurgency. Our government who runs the military showing constraint and acting at least at a tolerable level to the majority of people. The scenario is when the government no longer abides by this and is out of control. You put the US military in the hands of a government capable of mass murdering its own citizens there’s no stopping them with semi-automatic assault rifles.
Just so I can get this straight.  You mean to tell me that in your view a government who can't seem to stomach killing civilians/insurgents on the other side of the damn planet would be absolutely fine with sending out soldiers to kill its own citizens?
"Second, the vast majority of the door kickers in the military come from rural/suburban areas and backgrounds.  Now, you think they'd be just hunky dory with going into what is effectively their neighbors homes and towns to round up and kick in doors on people who are just like them, and potentially even family members?"
"Finally, there are 360 million citizens in the US.  Active duty military and reserves consist of about 2 million people.  25% of that is the US Navy and the Air Force so effectively you've got round 1.5 million soldiers and marines.  I'll be generous and say that 25% of those 1.5 million soldiers are actual combat troops and not logistics and support.  So that gives us about 375,000 actual combat troops to police 360 million citizens and over 3,537,438 square miles of territory in just the continental United states.  Tack that on to the fact that you would have to pull every single solitary combat soldier home to reach that number and completely abandon every foreign operation that we have going and that includes national guardsmen and reserves who are just as likely not to answer the call up to kick down the doors of their friends families and neighbors."
"Then there's the whole family aspect of it.  How long do you think it will take for the family of a soldier (his parents, his cousins, his children if he and his ex wife are separated) to face repercussions if its discovered that he's actively aiding the government against the insurgency/partisans.  "
"Nope, I think in the event of an organized popular insurgency, the military would be hard pressed indeed to try and put that insurgency down."
"I’ll respond in order: 
No, I don’t think our government currently would do that, but the scenario of a tyrannical government in which an uprising would be necessary against would certainly stomach murdering its own citizens. "
I never said there weren’t ways to win against the government. In this imagined scenario I’d agree with you that the downfall would most likely be that the soldiers just wouldn’t turn on their own people. 
"It’s a lot of people over a lot of land, but 80% of the US population lives in densely populated urban areas. The government could cripple an uprising by taking out just a few major cities. I mean, hell, they could shut off the grid and kill almost everyone that way. "
"You’re missing my point altogether. The hypothetical situation the founding fathers were thinking of was about people and their relationship with power in general. If the US government were to have the influence, brutality, and lack of care for its own people that we have seen humanity capable of throughout history, a bunch of assault rifle wielding rebels wouldn’t stand a chance against a government armed to the brim with missiles, helicopters, tanks, fighters, and war vessels."
"So in short, could the people of the US overthrow the government if it became evil? Yes. Would it be because the people had AR15s? I find it hard to believe."
"a bunch of assault  rifle wielding rebels wouldn’t stand a chance against a government armed  to the brim with missiles, helicopters, tanks, fighters, and war  vessels. "
"Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan (and that's just our conflicts) have repeatedly proven this to be false."
"They talk about fighting tyrrany, but they never actually do it."
It's easier to own a gun than to address corporate and governmental corruption.
"Or own a car, house, boat, pair of jeans, an Xbox, toothbrush, sneakers,..."
This is something I have picked up from other responses as well.
"I guess the US really likes to be in a situation where, as an individual, they can protect themselves, choose where they want to go, work live etc. without much government interference."
Reminder that Donald Trump is not a libertarian.

I once heard a body language expert give a talk on politicians. He showed some pictures of “candid shots” and showed how exaggerated and unnatural the facial expressions are and what emotions they are trying to convey at the time.
Can you elaborate? They were only exaggerated/unnatural when they think they're not being watched?
Well the examples were presidents and they know they are being watched all the time in public especially at the event. The particular example was Bill Clinton. I don't recall where he was. It was during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Basically his jaw was in an unnatural position. The expert showed his other pictures. He then asked the audience to try and make the face and see how difficult it is to make that face and how unnatural it is. He then commented how interesting it is to hold that unnatural pose (it wasn't a planned photo op).
Unrelated:
"The body language speaker joked on why George Bush won too based on body language. (Although this may not be forced body language) I forget which presidential debate (Al Gore or John Kerry). Basically, if you look at it, George Bush didn't do well at the debate but his posture is very warm and the other candidate (Gore/Kerry?)'s posture is very powerful (probably taught in law school/politics). He mentioned that the US loves underdog stories (not sure if that's true), and can see how people could almost feel sorry for George Bush in the debate. He was a poor puppy while (Gore/Kerry) was kicking the dog, no matter how well they did in the debate."
That's pretty interesting. Thank you.
So they don't show emotions? Got it
"They show plenty of emotions, you just never know when those emotions are real or not since one of their main professional skills is faking emotional expressions to a realistic degree.."
What about Vin Deisel?
What do you mean?  That's every emotion he has.
His job in that moment was to look uncomfortable
That's just his old man haemorrhoids playing up.

Hardcore trump supporters infest this subreddit claiming to be libertarians

It’s a sad truth that those of us who are willing to defend the free speech rights of racists and homophobes despite disagreeing with them tend to be outnumbered by actual fucking racists. Liberty has few friends.
"honest question, how do you tell the difference in a format such as this?"
"it is pretty easy to tell the difference between someone who says ""race war now"" and somebody who says ""that's stupid but allowed by the first amendment"""
The problem is a lot of the racists are getting smarter and know how to toe the line of acceptable discourse to sneak in some of their bigoted bullshit while maintaining plausible deniability.
"I don't care if you're a republican or a democrat or a socialist or a communist or a libertarian or a fascist or a conservative or a liberal - if you can't see how fundamentally, absurdly fucked up Donald Trump is, there's something broken in your head."
"I don't love Trump, and Trump has done some fucked up things, but, basically every president has (remember Clinton bombing a drug factory in Sudan for no reason except to distract from Monica Lewinsky?  Or Reagan invading Grenada? Or Obama normalizing drone striking an American citizen minor with no due process, or bush... invading iraq) at least Trump hasn't started a new foreign military adventure (yet)."
"Oh and Kennedy raped his 19 year old intern and made her give his secretary of defense a blowjob.  That man also started a conflict that ultimately took 3 million lives, 2 million of whom were civilians, and is on our half dollar and has two major monuments near the capital dedicated to him."
"Do we want to go over how the man on our dime evicted 100,000 citizens from their homes and continues to be worshipped by policymakers today?"
"Compared to these lionized figures, Trump's cruelty, in raw numbers, is still about an order of magnitude lower.  We should absolutely be taking him to task for it, but... Some perspective."
"I agree with a lot of what you've written here but Vietnam can't all be laid at the feet of Kennedy. Vietnam was a series of policy failures beginning with Truman, accelerating with Eisenhower and Kennedy, and exploding into full-blown war under Johnson. And Nixon really didn't make as much effort to end it as quickly as was implied in his campaign and during his Presidency."
"I mean, there's at least as many socialists and social democrats pretending to be libertarians in this sub. "
"Try defending free speech around here and you got about a 50% chance of having some ""libertarian"" telling you why hate speech is violence and why offensive jokes should be illegal."
Anyone can have libertarian ideals. 
"I'm a leftist, but firmly believe that everyone is free to do whatever the hell they want, until it infringes on someone else's liberties."
So do you believe that the government should be able to force me to pay for other people’s college or healthcare?  Because that infringes upon my liberties
So do you believe that the government should be able to force me to pay for other people’s college or healthcare?  Because that infringes upon my liberties.
"""Fuck all y'all, I got mine"" isn't a libertarian ideal. It's being a greedy, self-centered snatch who's going to really regret it when:"
"1- The working class have had enough, and revolt.
2- Everyone is dying from an illness that could have been prevented by access to healthcare.
3- We regress as a society, because there's not enough educated people to continue innovation, and we can't import it because a bunch of already undereducated morons voted to close the borders. "
"Now, here in the real world... I'll address your ""loss of liberties"" caused by being part of a society that values healthcare and education.  "
"If you buy insurance, you're already doing that. I've lived overseas, and seen how it works, better than our current profit driven system. "
"Don't have insurance? As far as that's concerned, you're going to be taken to the ER is you're injured, and you're infringing on other's liberties by making them pay for it, or provide services they won't be paid for."
"""Hey, this fucker isn't insured!"""
"""Ok, I'll get the orderlies to move him, so he doesn't die in the waiting room."""
"As far as education is concerned, you're already paying for up to 15 years of it, and have no say in the matter. "
"Don't own a home? Fine, but your landlord sure as hell uses the rent you pay to cover their property taxes. Don't rent either? Mom, Dad, or whoever you live with are paying their taxes too, or they wouldn't have a place to let you stay. "
"One major thing that ""socialised education"" gets right, is the elimination of tuition for profit at the mass scale we currently have. Another is that you're part of a group of 350+ million people that share a large plot of land. You may be fine with a growing percentage of idiots that can vote, but the rest of us aren't."
"I... firmly believe that everyone is free to do whatever the hell they want, until it infringes on someone else's liberties. "
"That's such a sliding scale. A lot of leftists are against people having guns because it makes them uncomfortable and that infringes on their pursuit to happiness, or dislike ""hate speech"" because it is violent to others' psyches. "
My solution: we all act like grownups and realize that the world is a dangerous and violent place sometimes.
"I'm a leftist, but firmly believe that everyone is free to do whatever the hell they want, until it infringes on someone else's liberties."
So you agree that taxation is theft?
Their platforms keep getting quarantined and banned. Need to keep an eye on them or they'll do the same here. Don't let their hatred or their memes become the norm here.

Got to be fair I was always under the impression this sub was  of pro Trump Conservatives pretending to be libertarians. It's refreshing to see so many calling it out.
Well you're delusional then.  A majority of the threads upvoted in here are posted by the same half dozen left leaning trolls. Aguineapig somehow manages to post steaming piles of garbage from 'commondreams.org' of all places and his threads frequently reach the front page.  The T_D trolls do try and break through but their obvious pro-trump posts all sit at 0 upvotes in 'new.'

Yes.  Not so you'd know when people in other subs mine it for karma in posts that hit all.

He’s a partisan idiot who has to make everything about politics
"An attempt to drive a wedge. “Sure, A and B anger you, but do they enough to identify with the overtly-partisan C? Didn’t think so!”"

"Ricky also has called Trump the most ""asinine person on the planet."""
Well he's not wrong
"And? <a href=""/r/TechnicallyTheTruth"">r/TechnicallyTheTruth</a>"
It’s because Ricky seems to have mostly unbiased views. I’m sure his views on guns are retarded but he seems to be pretty level headed on everything else.
Tbf his views on guns are perfectly reasonable for the country and culture he grew up in.
Unbiased views is an oxymoron
he's unbiased except for on guns where he disagrees with me and thus must be baised
"Lmao right?? They're almost at the point of self awareness lol.  Look at this guy who uses logic and reasoning for his positions and has a well rounded opinion, other than the one that I disagree with him on.  That one he is stupid for lol wut"
Odd how any view opposing a narrative is seen as retarded. People can’t have an objective view without being assigned a party or label. Sad that so many are so deep in the koolaid they no longer know how to breath normal air
He's well beyond that though. He's asseleven.
"He is. I dont look at trump like the Left does; as if he is some sort of evil madman racist, but Trump most certainly is asinine and a fool."

"He inadvertently makes a good point that we shouldn't give a shit what she thinks about anything, either."
"There are plenty of actual educated scientists, pretty much all of them, saying the same things. We don't need a high school dropout being the face of science."
"I mean, that's literally what she says. Her main point the whole time has been that everyone should be listening to the scientific community."
"It astounds me how many people miss this obvious point, classic case of attacking the messenger."
"shes against nuclear, thats not listening to the scientific community"
"Yea but she's not writing policy, she's just bringing attention to certain issues"
What really? Do she not put in us sharia veganism already?
Sharia veganism? Could you explain please? I feel out of the loop.
"That was supposed to be a joke, i forgot the /s on the post"
"I work in the power industry and am against nuclear because it doesn't make one iota of sense in most developed countries. It's a terrible investment. Takes years if not decades to build (even in nuclear friendly countries) and it doesn't mesh with the emerging generation profile of renewables and distributed generation. With the advent of renewables and distributed generation, nuclear as it exists today could not adequately provide ""peaking"" power to fill in the gaps that said renewables and DG leave."
"So how do you provide consistent, clean power at night when the wind is not blowing in a place with not a lot of water nearby? Thats the biggest issue: renewables are great, especially solar, but as soon as the sun sets, you lose a huge chunk of your power supply. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/world/europe/germany-coal-climate.html"">In gigarenewable countries like Germany</a>, while the share of renewable power sources has dramatically increased, the total watts provided as a share to the system has actually <em>decreased</em> viz coal in recent years. Why? Because while the country has kept apace with renewables for daytime power, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenrwald/2019/01/31/germanys-anti-coal-stance-by-the-numbers/#40428c6e2be3"">they got rid of their nuclear plants and had to shift a larger share of nighttime power generation to coal and natural gas</a>."
"Energy storage preferrably, but right now most likely natural gas. This article doesn't mention nuclear, but it is a type of baseload generation that provides the same function as coal generation."
"<a href=""https://www.digitalistmag.com/digital-supply-networks/2018/11/20/myth-of-baseload-power-in-australia-06194175"">https://www.digitalistmag.com/digital-supply-networks/2018/11/20/myth-of-baseload-power-in-australia-06194175</a>"

"What energy storage? We don't have the tech yet. The guy in the first article even recognizes that they don't have a solution yet. And all this is fine until you get a run of bad luck from say, weather, and you end up with no power at all. Like say, if fires were burning and soot covered solar panels. You may well need something else to use."
She's only started saying those things because people haven't been listening to the scientists.
The same people sure as shit aren't going to listen to her. Nor should anyone.
"The people giving her that platform have only done it so when anti-AGW idiots say the same things to/about her or the science they'd said to/about actual educated scientists and the science, those backing her can act shocked and appalled anyone would say such things about a child. All the while ignoring that a child has absolutely no clue about anything in the first place."
"Putting her on a pedestal only lowers the level of discourse. It's not helping anything. If anything, it's creating a greater divide."
"Now when stupid people say stupid things, they're met with equally stupid manufactured outrage instead of the actual facts and science of why they're wrong."
"""We shouldn't listen to people who are right if they are children"""
Yeah nah.
"No ones listening to her because she's an authoritative voice on the facts, people listen to her because she makes a compelling argument based on an accurate interpretation of what the scientists are telling us."
Her being a child is completely irrelevant
People are listening to her because she's the latest marketing campaign. It's preaching to the choir with an unassailable speaker.
"She's the latest market campaign because she's a child, because it means those backing her can lower the level of discourse to ad hominems on ad hominems instead of addressing the issues. Her being a child is the only reason she's been pushed to the forefront, because (clutches pearls) <em>what kind of monster would attack a child</em>!?"
That she's on the correct side of science largely doesn't matter. Making her into the celebrity face of the movement is a grossly cynical move.
"If I were to agree that all of that was true (and I dont) I still don't see what the problem is. She and the people she's associated with aren't trying to fuck people over or anything, they're trying to make global leaders pull their fingers out of their arses and start doing something meaningful about climate change."
At worst it's a cynical marketing campaign that uses a teenager after obtaining her informed consent to try and effect an outcome that will massively benefit the entire planet. On balance it's easily a net positive and the sum of its negatives barely registers in comparison to some of the shit western societies accept as normal.
The problem is she's being used as a pawn to lower the level of discourse even further than it was.
"Nobody is pulling their head out of their ass because Greta said so, and even fewer are doing it because they now get attacked for ""attacking a child"" when they're denying climate science."
"Pushing her only furthers the divide. Attacking AGW-deniers for ""attacking a child"" instead of addressing their actual science denial only digs their heels in deeper. It's an ironically Trumpian approach. It's not a net positive."
He inadvertently makes a good point that we shouldn’t give a shit what she thinks
Funny because she intentionally makes this point all the time that she’s far too young and inexperienced to be the face of this movement and that we need to listen to actual scientists who know what they’re talking about.
Yea no one should protest until they have a masters in the subject

It’s not like a shop opens up and everyone’s like “ah fuck, I’m legally bound to work there now.”  It just becomes another option for them"
"Those are not the only choices they have though. You're saying if Apple didn't have a factory in that country everyone would just have to die? Because that's what you're implying. Apple is singlehandedly keeping the population of China alive, being the only feasible work opportunity."
"Just take another job or be a farmer, right? Why would this explanation of “starve to death or work isn’t a choice” count for them but normally be scoffed at by capitalist libertarians?"
You QAnon shitgibbons are the most pathetic bipeds on the planet. Gervais was obviously hilarious - he always is. And it's always nice to see these self-aggrandizing douches taken to task. He takes no prisoners. Never has. And that includes supreme leader there in the white house.
"Your crusade to try and persuade people you're not the laughingstock you are is pure comedy. You're a joke. Gervais has shit all over Trump's idiocy on multiple occasions. He has laughed at his supporters and expressed pity for those stupid enough to believe his tripe. It's difficult for me to comprehend how even a jadrool like you could devote so much time spreading such lunacy.  A better man would feel bad for you, but I can't seem to find any compassion for your deranged folly.  "

He also quipped on how unregulated capitalism hurts workers.

"Ricky Gervais isn’t an ordinary citizen who’s tired of the self righteous wealthy, his jokes about Hollywood liberal aren’t rooted in his own genuine dissatisfaction, those are his friends &amp; peers. "
"He’s not some daring truth teller, holding the powerful accountable for their self righteousness."
"NBC is paying him millions to host a glorified roast session, where the rich take an opportunity to laugh at themselves while still making a profit. "
"The “no limits” brand of comedy is entirely disingenuous, there’s a plethora of limitations to what Ricky or any other entertainer can actually say on national television."
"This is exactly correct. I’m sure he veered off script at points and he was certainly “edgier” than getting some true toothless hack like jimmy fallon  host, but to think he was going rogue in any sense of it is delusional. You’re absolutely correct that it’s a glorified roast. They wouldn’t hire him and people wouldn’t show up if they truly thought he would do something truly confrontational."
“DeNiro keeps his anti trump pie hole shut” Jesus this sounds like a boomer wrote this.
"Jesus, I have no idea why people are upvoting this guy. All he do is spew conspiracy to try and get people to come to his conspiracy subreddits"
"Ah, yes, after frequently criticizing Hollywood for supposedly discriminating against people because of their viewpoint, we're now cheering Ricky for encouraging people to be more sincere in their convictions and choose jobs and roles based on those convictions."
And OP does this without a whit of self-awareness.
I personally don’t like his anti religious stance but holy fuck he didn’t just roast the celebrities he scorched them. 10/10.
Why do you care if he’s anti-religious? Aren’t you supposedly a libertarian?
"Uhh, being a libertarian doesn't stop you from having a personal opinion on anything"
"If I am a libertarian, then I should have the freedom to like or dislike people."
Atheism is a religion to him.  He preaches on the topic just as much as any pastor.  Its kind of hypocritical.  Also hes a condescending asshole.
"I see nothing wrong with being Anti-Trump, he's an impeached moron who's trying to start a war."
Ricky was 100% correct. Of course those Hollywood degenerates are too self-centered to realize he was talking about them.
"As far as being ""Anti-Trump"", that's not necessarily a bad thing. That's not necessarily a good thing either."
Virtue signaling for dudebros.
I love Ricky but this is some weak stuff here. Sorry to burst the Trump nuthuggers balloon
Ricky Jarvis rant had nothing to do with trump.  
What’s your point?
Good on Gervais for roasting all the virtue signalers in Hollywood
"If the word ""Trump"" wasn't in the title, perhaps this could have been an intelligent discussion about government corruption in general... Instead it's simply a ""state whether or not you like Trump"" roster. Nice going."

"This was in reference to right before this him naming mega corporations like Apple, Amazon, and Disney shaming them as well."
"I disagree with him fundamentally on foreign policy.  He sees our foreign policy as instigation, I see our presence out there as being necessary for quick reaction.  So we disagree on that, but that’s Ron Paul’s view and Ron Paul’s always been against having bases overseas."
"What I find surprising and actually inconsistent is his defense of the Iran nuclear deal.  You’re going to pay a hostile nation ransom money because they say they’ll halt their nuclear program?  Yeah, okay.  Non-interventionism as I’ve understood it hasn’t meant going to the far-left on everything to do with foreign policy,"
You’re going to pay a hostile nation ransom money because they say they’ll halt their nuclear program?
"How are we, the US, not the hostile nation? Also, how is easing off sanctions the same as ""paying""?"
"You’re going to pay a hostile nation ransom money because they say they’ll halt their nuclear program? Yeah, okay."
"Why not?  Iran has <em>every fucking right</em> to pursue nuclear technology.  If we don't want them to do so, why not pay them not to?  The alternative is war, which costs, yeah, tremendously more"
"The difference between paying them and military action, aside from principles, is that military action actually stops them in their tracks.  Paying them just gives them more money to fund terrorism and their nuclear program."
Lol
"If you honestly believe that military action <em>stops terrorism,</em> you haven't been paying much attention these last few decades."
"Let's be honest, though: you're a Redcap and support Trump no matter what he does, because that's how lackeys behave.  Correct?"
Worked after 9/11.  Also worked on crippling ISIS.
Derp
"Don’t derp me, I’m right."
"You're not right about shit, Redcap.  Global terrorism has been sky-high since 9/11, we didn't do shit to stop it"
And what you really meant to say was <em>creating ISIS.</em>  Our military idiocy in Iraq CREATED them.
"Sheesh, you're a fucking idiot"
"Global terrorism =/= attacks on the US.  Don’t know where you’ve been regarding ISIS either, but last I checked we were kicking the shit out of them, and we no longer hear about them as a threat to anything."
"Lol, what a waste of my time this has been"
"Fuck off, Redcap idiot"

"Honestly the far left could care less about war the anti war left has been MIA for 12 years and are just now popping up again. This strike was only bad to them because Trump ordered it and the right only agrees with the strike because Trump ordered it. Trump supporters were cheering him on when he said we need to get out of the middle east now our bases are ""necessary"". Hypocrites everywhere."
anti war left has been MIA for 12 years a
"Annoying as he is, Bernie Sanders has been quite visible for some time and hasn't been missing at all in that time frame."
He is also vocally anti war.
Sanders big claim is not voting for Iraq but he didn't seem to have much issue with bombing Libya or all of the drone strikes. Saying you are anti war and going out of your way to hold your own side accountable are two different things. It's like Republicans who talk about cutting spending but when in office continue to raise the debt.
"He condemned the bombing of Libya, and never signed on as a proponent of it."
His most damning act for Libya was saying gaddafi should resign.
"He is more anti war than Obama was for sure. However, I don't consider rhetoric on war and actions the same thing. In 2012 the anti war left should have considered backing a different candidate than Obama. He was elected to end the wars and didn't but they did not hold him accountable. Instead they put party over principle. The only candidate on the left who is 100% anti war(Tulsi) and is making it a priority is polling low and has no shot at the nomination which shows where the left really stands on war. It was only a priority to most of them when Bush was in office."
Sanders in 2012 was a nobody who wouldn't have had any ability to back shit. He also couldnt run as he was running for Senate.
"In 2008 Ron Paul was considered a nobody, he never backed the nominee like Sanders did and refused to just fall in line for the good of the party. His principle was paramount even if it put his congressional reelection in jeopardy. Sanders plays the political game for his own career. his domestic socialist policies on the forefront of his campaign. His war stances take a back seat."
In 2012 the anti war left should have considered backing a different candidate than Obama.
"Sorry, but this is a pretty retarded take"
No party with a sitting president is going to back an alternative challenger.  Ever.  This isn't a serious suggestion from you and it isn't a valid criticism of the Dems at all
"Putting party over principle is the retarded take. They won't back a different candidate because they are spineless cowards lookinng out for their political careers. It is perfectly valid. To them party comes first. Obama ran on ending wars yet bombed Libya, ramped up drone strikes and let the existing wars drag on. His own party never challenged it directly. They made excuses for it and since most the anti war protests instantly vanished upon his election there was no pressure. As dumb as Trump's drone strike was the ""anti war"" left popping their heads up after this time to protest thinking they still have a spot at the adults table makes me sick. If anti war was so important to the left Tulsi Gabbard would be winning in the polls. However she is not, It is only important to them because it was Trump who ordered it. Trump is a turd make no mistake but they have no grounds anymore criticizing war related topics."
He also condemned the US for their role in Yemen.
"Could be a regional thing, but far-leftists back where I lived were still anti-war.  They weren’t a fan of Obama’s drone strikes, and the DNC might finally be making in-roads with them between Bernie support and anti-Trump sentiment."
Their rhetoric anti war but their actions dont reflect it. They did little to stand up to Obama's escalated drone strikes.
"They protested, what else do you expect them to do?  Lmao.  I don’t agree with them, but I wouldn’t fault them for inconsistency the way I would more mainstream Democrats."
"If war was so important then they would put principle over party and back a different candidate. Obama continued many if Bush's war policies despite running on ""peace"" yet party was more important so they backed him and down played it."
"They didn’t back Obama, at least not at the time.  Idk, maybe I just got to see more of the real crazies in action."
It's been vary curious watching the right wing think this was some great coup de grace.  As if Hollywood is all 'liberals' care about.
But that's what living in a echo chamber does to your brain.
Yet the responses are from right wing clowns that think rich liberals paying lip service to liberal causes and liberal multi nationals are the far left.
the most offensive part of Gervais’ routines nowadays is that they’re not funny
This is pro bono propaganda for Trump’s so called defensive war.
What are your disagreements with what she said?
I stopped listening when she started her spin on how he’s actually a really bad guy and people are happy he’s dead. Brain dead irrelevant take on the matter that’s only purpose is to serve as more pro-war propaganda.
"I think we can all agree that Soleimani was a pretty bad guy. I have read articles condemning the president’s actions that even admit this. If you go on to watch the rest of it, her take is more in approval of Soleimani’s death instead of any rhetoric implying that we should go to war with Iran. She also mentions in Iran how she (7 years old) and others were forced to chant “Death to America!” without knowing what it meant. I really don’t see any motive she would have to spread false propaganda like that. Nevertheless, I find it to be an interesting perspective."
Rhetoric approving of his death easily doubles as pro-war propaganda. No matter how terrible a human being is that doesn’t justify Trump’s assassination of him in Iraq territory. That was an act of war against two countries. You won’t see people like this talking about how bad US backed leaders in Saudi Arabia and Israel are and how they deserve to die for example so don’t blame me for my disinterest in them when they can’t even be consistent.
"There’s no blame here, I’m just furthering the discussion. I personally don’t think approving of a terrorist’s death is necessarily tantamount to pro-war propaganda, but I can definitely see in some areas how it can be. "
"In Erica’s case, I think the approval has more to do with the thankfulness she and others have for Soleimani’s death and less to do with the overall implications of the US’s relationship with Iran. She seemed to imply she was somewhat raised in Iran, but now she’s American. She mentions how MSM is propping the idea that the people of Iran mourn Soleimani and then gives her perspective where people in Iran are actually celebrating his death. "
I find the parallel between those two narratives fascinating and I’m unsure which I should give credit to more. So I’m interested in reading what everyone else thinks.
Thank you
You’re welcome!
"As a libertarian, it’s incredibly sad how little news gets released on the party."
"It probably won't be streamed live, the live TV debates usually don't start until around April. These early debates are exclusively run by the State Parties, and the debate footage is made available a few days after the fact."
Very interesting.  Be curious to see what this leads to.
"Iran controlling Iraq functionally, further funding to terrorism against Saudi Arabia, Kurds, Americans, and Israel.."
Just a likely hypothetical.
The complexity of all of this is crazy.  It's interesting how everyone on FB/social media has such strong opinions on such complex things.
"Iran already has a strong influence on Iraq with the US supporting Iraq, why would it go down?"
Iran also already funds terrorism as mentioned.
"All I did was suggest without the US, they'd get bigger since no counterbalance US."
"Understood, I wasn't criticizing your comment, I was making a side note about how complex this all is and how your comment shows that"
"China will continue to buy Iran's oil, and China has no reason to limit oil imports anytime soon. One of the main goals of their Belt and Road Initiative is to divert Middle East trade away from the West and towards China/the East. Iran will prosper under a China/Russia alliance."
"Iraq will be consumed by Iran. They've tried several times before, and without the US directly in Iraq, they could succeed. (Saudi Arabia might try to have more of a presence in Iraq, or attempt to create a buffer from Iran if Iraq is split domestically (pro Sunni vs pro Shite governance)."
"Syria/Iraq/Iran will flourish, with Russia and China not far away. If Turkey leaves NATO, then the Middle East is lost. The Saudi/Israel alliance will be questionable without the US. "
The only way to avoid US war is to just leave that area.
"This is why imperialism with no real ties (cultural, race, religion)to the area/region almost always fails. "
The imperialistic just delays the inevitable and all parties involve suffer. 
The US government is reaping what they've sowed since the late 70s.
The US government is reaping what they've sowed since the late 70s.
The rich/military complex sure are benefiting.
True. And they do influence policy. 
I guess what I mean by USG is the actual system. The pillars of the Constitution weren't built on the idea it would help take over the world or regions in the mid east. Then then you massage then fuck it beyond recognition (the Constituion) and you get this.
"I don't think the US has ever been percieved this weak on the international stage. Allies don't trust us, Russia is having it their way, China is doing its thing. "
There are other ways to form good relationships and have a strong global presence than missiles and guns.
The Middle East was always lost. The US was only there to blow shit up to goose the MIC because they got a blank check after US citizens called for blood following 9/11.
Iran controlling Iraq functionally
That ship sailed when we ousted the Sunni Ba'athists and installed Iran's best friend Ahmed Chalabi as their Prime Minister.
Turns out Bush's entire staff was run by Know Nothings and starting a war with the guy you'd sold chemical weapons to in the 80s precisely because he was going to contain the Iranian Revolution was... <em>checks notes</em> a huge fucking mistake.
"Not our problem Israel and Saudi Arabia have large military forces they can figure out the best course to
take for their nation."
"Everyone needs allies. It only makes sense for the overlap of religious and ethnic groups of Iran and Iraq to come closer together, and the lame duck Iraqi president recently laid out the very obvious basis for long term peace: economic cooperation and cultural exchange."
"The US has long opposed this solution to the increased prosperity that actually cures Islamic extremism because we only want the ""right"" Muslims to succeed."
"Edit: as an expansion here, the Saudis and israelis are every bit extremist Marauders as Iran"
Saudi I get but can you point to the Israeli jihadists and their oppression of women and execution of gay folk?
Marauders as in blowing people up to expand their influence.
By that definition it makes just about every country marauders. I wouldn't label Israel as extremist.
I'd argue the exact opposite notion. Most countries are not waging wars like America and Israel.
"They certainly are not alone, though, and pretty well adhere to modern tactics. Not targeting cultural sites for no reason other than disproportionate response, for example"
"further funding to terrorism against Saudi Arabia, Kurds, Americans, and Israel"
"you win some, you lose some"
There will be a chemical attack or something that prevents this from happening.

"What if Trump actually gets us out of Iraq, and this is how it happens?"
<em>exhales</em>
"Hey, even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while."
"I’d bet a good sum that at best it will be one of those “(small number of specific type of troops) are being relieved of their active duty responsibility in Iraq...we will retain 40,000 troops there as consultants and security support and are deploying 10,000 more for additional logistical support.” It’s been that way every time we’ve “exited” any of these countries."
The first line in the fucking article is the military saying that they arent leaving lol.
lol... get the hell out man. Garbage invading governments.
This is good news only if we bring them all home instead of sending them to some other middle eastern country.
"We should assassinate officials in Japan and Germany to get our troops out of there too. If we bomb every country, soon we will be isolationist."
"Now let's actually bring them HOME, not just place them in Syria or Saudi Arabia instead."
"they have since amended that to ""LOL just kidding"""
Yea no I heard US isn't leaving till iraq at least pays for the bases
Let me guess. Orange man bad again right ?

The last time congress approved a war was 1942.
"<em>Declared.</em> I would say the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists"">AUMF</a> is Congress giving approval for these recent misadventures."
"Yeah, it's odd to me that Trump gets so much flack for these little limited strikes. Everybody starts calling him a Nazi and a dictator. But when Obama supports/practically creates movements in Libya and Syria to overthrow their government, which makes those countries collapse into chaos and hundreds of thousands of people die, the media barely mentions it."
Congress: Continuously concede their war powers to the executive branch for decades.
"Executive: Elected president makes a unilateral decision to launch a targeted airstrike, potentially bringing the nation into war."
"Congress: Wait, no. That's not how you play the game."
"This is what happens when you continually push off your written responsibilities onto one entity. Eventually someone you can't trust or don't agree with gets elected to that position and all the power you've spent decades giving up is now in their hands. Congress needs to take back all of their war powers. Enough ""not a war, just an armed conflict"" bull shit."
"Seriously.  As much as I hate this crazy partisan circus I'd love if it ended in better separation of powers.  Doubt it will happen, they seem to be just fine coming together to pass bloated budgets, the PATRIOT Act or whatever we're calling it now, keeping domestic spying going, helping industry giants to entrench themselves with regulations, but maybe there's a glimmer of hope.  Maybe."
"Except that he is a dictator.  Tell me one thing Trump could do that would cause the senate to impeach him.  If you can't come up with anything, he is a dictator."
"If he actually withdrew the military from the Middle East, the Senate would remove him faster than you can say “Lockheed Martin sets US foreign policy.”"
"<em>All</em> the Middle East? It's looking like we might leave Iraq, good or not. The Iraq War could finally finish this year."
All the Middle East.
"Withdrawing from Iraq just to shuffle the troops to say, Syria is a wash"
"Darn, looks like they are shuffling to Kuwait."
Yeah no surprise.
"“Withdrawal” just means “shuffling slightly”, remember they used the same rhetoric in Syria."
Would you say that WW2 has yet to end then? Since the US has had troops deployed in our German bases since then?
"Obviously no, treaties were signed that formally ended hostilities."
But that’s irrelevant to the empire’s permanent presence.
Doubtful.
*remove him. Not impeach him. I agree with that sentiment.
Declare a new world order with himself as emperor and build a death star.
"More realistically, he may be a dictator in the sense of Roman times, but not modern. He loses the election hes done. He violates the constitution, courts stop him."
The courts can't stop him from launching military attacks.
Congress can.
But won't
"He violates the constitution, courts stop him."
lol
"I mean, Trump can be replaced without being removed from office forcefully. There is the whole ""Election"" thing we have every 4 years that could accomplish that."
That's only possible if the elections are legitimate.
"Trump can make sure his party disenfranchises people who would vote against him, thus winning the election without popular support."

"Here are some other ideas: Trump could invalidate unfavorable election results once he has finished purging the ranks of the intelligence services based on ""classified information"".  He could replace enough people to control the FBI and then frame political opponents for crimes (<strong>this happens in Russia all the time</strong>).  There are thousands of things that Trump could do now that he has proven that his supporters will turn their heads on blatant violations of the law.  He could write an executive order to increase presidential term limits.  He could declare that the democratic party is a terrorist organization (like they've already done for environmental activist groups).  He could turn a blind eye to right wing terrorists, so that anyone who dares to speak against the Trump regime would have to live in fear of being targeted."

"It's strange that you put the burden of proof on the defendant, that's exactly what the liberals who hate the constitution do. Asking what Trump has done that warrants impeachment would be a better question. I suggest you go visit North Korea and see what a real dictator is."

The irony of you making this comment.
"Please, describe how this is ironic."
Nope. You’re just to dim to understand that you don’t have a point. Lol 😂

He’s not if the voters have him obey the law.  Will you vote to let him defy the law or obey it?
You sound like a dramatic dummy.

"Or he is innocent, as in until proven guilty.  Call him what you will but that is not how the law works."
If that was actually how the law works he wouldn’t have been able to kill the general without a trial.  There are lots of different rules for different situations.
"Or he is innocent, as in until proven guilty.  Call him what you will but that is not how the law works."
Remind me again how many subpoenas he's refusing to obey?
Except that he is a dictator.
Why the histrionics?
Vote him out. I'll help.
You can't do <em>that</em> to a dictator. 
"No, he isn't a dictator. Unless he is an anatomically correct Mr Potato Head, then he is certainly a dictator."
Vote him out. I'll help.
"Except the GOP is doing everything in their power to prevent a fair and honest election, like suppressing legitimate voters while refusing to secure our voting booths from actual hacking."

"Are any conservatives speaking out on this stuff yet? Liberal arguments it are a dime a dozen and are all well and fine, but I'm curious about the other side of the fence. Are they just staying quiet on this or have some of them actually grown a spine?"

The feckless congress abdicated their responsibilities regarding declarations of war generations ago
"I agree.  However, can democrats say this when Obama did the same thing without declaration of War by Congress?"
"Obama requested authorization from Congress to air strike Assad’s military. And then when he didn’t get it, he didn’t order any strikes."
"And then when he didn’t get it, he didn’t order any strikes."
"Wow, quite the dictator."
A self crowning king with no respect for the law

Hi Darth

Your username is propaganda.
"You spam this sub with <em>actual</em> propaganda constantly. Commondreams, The Independent, Newsweek, The Daily Beast, etc."
Only Obama can abuse executive power
That was shit last decade and called out then too.
"Not really, not to the extent it is now."
Prove that statement and your feelings don't count...
"Ok bud, where was obamas impeachment proceedings by members of Congress, trump is being impeached for the same reasons, abuses of executive power, again obama did the same shit, even worse but yet there was very little resistance. Again, very little resistance. Infact he was hailed by most of the media as a saintly figure. "
I mean were you going around in 2010 doing what you do now except with Obama? Or did that just start with the trump era.
What impeachable things did Obama do that was worse than Trump?
"Jesus, proving my point for me "
"Could just look it up yourself, "
"Here’s one, abusing executive power to direct military strikes (acts of war) without congressional approval "
Or abusing the power that comes from declaring something a “national emergency” 
Even to stacking courts

Pathetic
You guys are so mercenary it makes me sick
Could y’all share who your employers are?
Whatever you say buddy! Not my fault you’re a fucking idiot.
Weak. Nobody cares about Obamas military usage. Not like el trumpo isn't any worse with his drones. 
Next you're gonna tell me Trump was just interested in corruption and wasn't totally trying to gain favors against a political rival. Never mind the blatant obstruction.
Abuse of power.
Nah.
Elaborate
He ordered the assassination(s) of American citizens without trial.
Are you talking about Anwar Al-Awlaki ..?
"Him, his son, and some other people. Even a trial in absentia would've been something."
"So how is that worse than <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/"" rel=""nofollow"">Trump</a>?"
You forgot the /s . though it should have been obvious...
Only safe Democrats like Obama can routinely drone enemies without constraint or protest. Thus sayeth the first law of double standard.
Trump has also been droning to his heart contempt and no one said shit about it . Did Donald get impeached over droning ? Was he called a dictator over droning ? So what double standard are you talking about ?
"Guess what, how you carry yourself matters. Having a proper mandate opposed to a farcical one solely obtained due to the distorsion of the Electoral College also matters. Obama won the popular vote by 10M votes and still he was always the guy trying to unify."
"Trump lost the popular vote by 3M votes and he's behaving like the number of Americans voting for him was 300M. Not even trying to unify or reach across the values of Democrat voters. Always saying stuff that's divisive, always saying and tweeting crazy shit and conspiracy stuff. Always behaving like a child and a lunatic, seems your stereotypical mentally challenged uncle."
"Again how you carry yourself matters. Trump has benefited from this thing for his whole life. He's not very bright or smart (and his business record proves it) and yet he enjoyed the best cars, the best quality of life, planes, tons of women...etc. "
All that because the inherited wealth gave him tools to carry himself better than people who were way smarter but did not inherit wealth and were grinding themselves out like Jeff Bezos .
"Nobody is gonna shed a tear for such double standard. ""Peception is reality"" giveth and taketh."
"If you look to the research of Dr. Robert Epstein, the victory margin in the popular vote by Clinton can be attributed to manipulation by Google. Also Clinton was driving out the vote in safe states to make the popular vote argument you now make. She was in no danger of losing any of those and squandered resources getting the vote out, and many of those places had poor voter integrity."
"Obama did not unify. The first time I heard him giving the keynote speech at the DNC convention he was talking about post partisan healing. But he governed as a divider, and racism and antagonism between ethnic groups widened and worsened during his term as Democrats played upon those division for political expediency."
"And there were libertarians who opposed Obama droning, but this did not fit the adoring media narrative and those stories were buried. But now all of a sudden the media narrative puts out anything, factual or not that denigrates this president and we have widespread concerns over the ethics of droning on the left."
manipulation by Google
You mean the same Google LLC subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. which made billions with the tax cuts? That Google LLC? They were manipulating to favor Clinton?
But he governed as a divider
If Obama governed as a divider how is Trump governing? If you think Obama was a divider then Trump is a full blown dictator
but this did not fit the adoring media narrative and those stories were buried
"Of course the stories are buried, when the country is with you to the tune of 10M votes and a high approval rating of course stories are getting buried. Newspapers and media organizations are businesses, and in such conditions people don't consume media who criticize the President, or do so to a lesser degree. Add to that the important factor that the economic relevance of the Democrat base is way greater than the Republican base."
"On top of that News organizations tend to be located in big urban centers on the coasts, so they have a bias toward Democrats"
"Finally illegal immigrants and suppressed voters such as former inmates and the likes might not be able to cast their votes, but sure as hell they vote with their wallets when buying newspapers exposing Trump and with their eyeballs when they visit websites and communities which oppose him"
"Epstein on <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/33/E4512.full.pdf?with-ds=yes"" rel=""nofollow"">SEME</a> and <a href=""https://aibrt.org/downloads/EPSTEIN_MOHR_&amp;_MARTINEZ_2018-WPA-The_Search_Suggestion_Effect-SSE-WP-17-03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">SSE</a> in scholarly papers, as well as <a href=""https://aibrt.org/downloads/EPSTEIN_&amp;_WILLIAMS_2019-WPA-Evidence_of-search_engine_bias_related_to_2018_midterm_elections.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper on manipulating elections</a>. These are all peer reviewed published research."
"Obama and Democrats have as a basic strategy identity politics. People are divided into various groups which then are stated as being oppressed by a patriarchy or white men or Christians. The basic strategy is to pick a group that makes up a large part of the GOP, brand it as an oppressor, then state that only Democrats can fight for you to stop the oppression. This was undeniably their strategy, and continues to this day to be the main strategy of the Democratic party."
"As they divide and fuel dissent and animosity, so they sew division among the American people. Things like the Constitution and its ideas which typically united diverse people as a nation are down played or ignored and the Democratic party positions itself as the common thing uniting all of these groups. There is so much acrimony among this coalition that now they have to personify and demonize President Trump, and from what I can tell that is the only thing they have in common is this irrational hate of the president."
"While fueling hate does drive up voter turnout, the long term byproduct of this has been division and a complete shut down of any form of compromise in governance owing to partisanship."
"You assert without proof the absurd claim that Trump is a dictator, and perhaps this is your way of virtue signaling to others that you are a member in good standing of the Democratic party. It does not really work for me. You will have to defend your thesis better than that with facts and refrain from insults to sway me via reason."
demonize President Trump
"Lol. In every society ever, literally every society ever a guy who is dumb as a rock and only enjoys his status due to inherited wealth is hated and disrespected . There is no grand scheme or conspiracy by the Democrats voters and politicians . They are simply acting as every human who ever lived. The anomaly is Republicans...they venerate a guy who can't even put a coherent phrase together because they hate the liberal concepts so much and they are so confrontational that they see politics as some sport in which they have to beat the other side and "" bathe in their tears""."
"It's not about ideas, it's about the dopamine kick you get after your side wins the election which is way more rare than the one you get after your team wins a game....and these people pursue that high, they also have chants like ""lock-her-up"" which sound very similar ""S-E-C"" , ""Let's-go-Red-Sox"", ""Fuck-you-Yankees""... and a bunch of other sports chants."
"Also about the ample candidates field and debate going in the Democratic party, you think it's acrimony, in reality it's the healthiest thing . It shows that ideas are being exchanged and debated, you range from Bloomberg to Sanders and you find an ample spectrum of nuances and ideas. The GOP instead is a monolith, it's not even the GOP anymore, it's Trump's party because of the cult of personality around the guy. Mitt Romney is the last making a stand, at least with his rethoric , even though he's voting within party lines."
"People on the right DON'T SAY stuff like : ""I like what we are doing in the Middle East"" or ""we need to stay focused and stop China from stealing our IP"".....no they say stuff like ""Trump did show those Iranians who is the boss"", or ""Trump really intimidated Xi with that firm handshake"". Dumb shit like that is really sad to see from people who are supposedly adults."
"In fact people who have been around Trump (even Republicans) consider him an idiot. People who are not blinded by wealth like Rex Tillerson consider him a ""fucking moron"". Tillerson would know , he saw guys like Trump on the 11th power in the Middle East where inbred dudes hold power solely because their ancestors happened to have won some empty territory from some other tribe, and stuck (black)gold when smart self made men like J.D Rockefeller and John Paul Getty (which again are the opposite of Trump and his Middle Eastern counterparts) went there with their companies and their geologists to find $2 per barrel oil underneath ."
While fueling hate does drive up voter turnout
"Again, fueling what exactly? People like Trump have always been hated throughout the history of our specie. You can go back in time and find some inept son of a prodigious Mammoth hunter enjoy a high status life with a zero or net negative contribution to the tribe...I bet that he was hated, for sure not respected or cited as an example for the younger generations."
You assert without proof the absurd claim that Trump is a dictator
"Guy is flying the concept of not leaving, praising guys like XI and Putin and wondering if we should ""try the strong leader concept here someday"" . Even before getting elected he threatened  a political rival saying that ""she'd be in jail"" , on stage during a Presidential debate. Said on numerous occasions that he wanted to kill journalists . WTF."
"Also if you are a Republican and you're not like 82 years old, Trump is doing the biggest disservice to you, if I were a Republican (I am a pragmatist-libertarian fyi) I'd be enraged as the country is already getting more left leaning by the second, on top of that you have this orangutan doing all this unpopular stuff and tweeting all this unpopular shit, conspiracy theories and acting like a wannabe Putin or Xi Jin Ping...Democrats will rule the country for 20 years after Trump is gone (either democratically or he's forced out by the Secret Services)"
"Inherited wealth...had he brought nothing to the table he would be worth the millions or so he got from his Dad. Most businessmen fail many times before they succeed, and he has done so. Your error is assuming that starting capital matters more than being the kind of person who knows how to make money. Bankruptcy courts are littered with people who had money and did not know how to succeed. What you are doing is a full denial of what he has accomplished with his life, and you attribute all of it to inheritance, which is not very informed at all. You compound your mistake by thinking this justifies you to assault his character."
"What you are doing is a full denial of what he has accomplished with his life, and you attribute all of it to inheritance, which is not very informed at all. You compound your mistake by thinking this justifies you to assault his character."
"Dude...Trump inherited 500+ millions...his net worth is not even determinable, it's mostly illiquid stuff and stuff that he inflates or deflates at will, in the first case to secure more dollars for the same collateral with banks and in the second case to pay less taxes."
Even if you consider all those things he still underperformed the market by a lot....besides have you seen the guy speak? Have you seen his record? Dozens and dozens of bankruptcies . This is not a bright nor a smart individual. Nor general intelligence and nor domain specific intelligence .
"Guy was selling branded steaks to Macy's and the like and said that 2007 was ""the best time to open a mortgage company"""
"Add to that the corners cutting, back of the room deal to launder money."
"Casinos, Hotel, handpicking jurisdictions in the world based on how much of a financial opacity they can grant him"
By his own admission in the 90s he was 8 billion dollars in debt.
"On top of that people who are really smart like Bezos, Gates, Simons, Overdeck and the like do recognize the importance of luck, Trump literally believes he's the chosen one and second coming."
Also you conveniently avoided conceding that the stuff he says and does are in line with a dictator or wanna be dictator.
"The bottom line: Your golden boy is a dumb idiot, he's full of shit and the hatred towards him is fully in line with historical precedents of our specie. He's doing a disservice to your ideals and if the GOP had any guts and self preserving instinct it would convict him and run Mitt Romney in 2020, who is a healthy person, with a healthy mind and capability to do the job and propel right-wing ideals."
"No doubt Trump is a narcissist, and you will find that quality in many of those who are in TV or very wealthy."
"You should watch Shark Tank sometime and get a feel for just how frequently businessmen fail before succeeding. A rare few succeed on their first try. Naval Ravikant, angel investor, and icon for many in Silicon valley describes in his own words how his first two efforts failed miserably. "
"Furthermore you assume because I do not sanction complete and utter character assassination of Trump that he is somehow my golden body or ideal. This is pretty typical of a low effort troll, to slap onto others a speculative extreme position to strawman. I voted for Cruz in the primary, Castle in the general, and I have patchwork support of Trump on issues. Trump with all of his flaws has been much better at governance than Obama as evidenced by the fact that my 401K is now growing instead of stalling, my kid is employed and not living in my basement, and a number of other significant changes. "
"The thing is that presidential elections is not about voting for a utopian and perfect candidate. They are all flawed in many ways. It is about picking the best of what is out there, and from what I can tell even with this massive primary field the Democrats have nothing better than Trump to offer."
"Trump with all of his flaws has been much better at governance than Obama as evidenced by the fact that my 401K is now growing instead of stalling, my kid is employed and not living in my basement, and a number of other significant changes."
I guess your investments were badly allocated considering that the market bottomed in late 09.
"In any event the policy for the economy of this administration was to stay out of the business way. Supply side economics or Reaganomics . Trump is doing a disservice to such ideas by being his dumb, corrupt self."
"As I said once he's done, Democrats would rule the country for 20 years or even more considering how demographically the country is getting more left leaning by the second."
"Considering the demographic factors you'd have to be perfect in each and every other domain (especially with regards to social freedoms, minority rights, foreign policy, international crdibility...) to make people swallow supply side economics and being happy with it so that it won't be scrapped by the subsequent administration. Supply side economics is the best policy but it tends to become unpopular rather quickly considering how the rate of people getting wealthier is disproportional. So again you'd have to be perfect."
They are all flawed in many ways
"Find a flaw in Mike Bloomberg. He's propelling supply side economics, while at the same time being socially liberal and most importantly being a sane, moderate and healthy person. Economically a Republican without all that dumb shit about abortion, religion and conspiracy theory such as QANON or the Pizza-gate."
"He's also a person who can coherently put a phrase together and is able to handle a conversation with the German Chancellor who is fucking nuclear physicist , whereas we are stuck with Trump."
If America was a country functioning properly 2020 election would be Mitt Romney vs Mike Bloomberg....instead is going to be Senile Speech-impaired Crazy Orange man vs Senile Crazy Comrade Sanders
"Lick those boots a bit harder there, ya fucking lackey"
What war? 
He killed a terrorist. No one complained when he did in the ISIS moron
Have you bought that line for the past 20 years? Are all of our wars in the Middle East just about killing terrorists? There are terrorists all over the world. Have you ever asked yourself why we’re not concerned with going after terrorists in most other places?
"Also, imagine if another country had killed one of our top officials and tried to say it wasn’t a war."
Right... that's all Iraq and Afghanistan were too.  Just killing terrorists...
"He killed an Iranian General, not a terrorist."
Who was the head of a designated terrorist organization actively engaged in attacks on Americans
So the United States is terrorists? Because that's child's play compared to what our generals do
"Who designates whether someone is a terrorist organization?  What is stopping them from simply calling anyone they don't like a ""terrorist"" in order to circumvent established law regarding the use of military or police force?"
"In this case, the US Government under executive order 13224 in October of 2007. Your peace loving friends in Canada have come to the same conclusion as well."
"An order that Obama declined to rescind, I assume."
Wrong. Obama maintained it
"Ah yes, and who was it that designated the Revolutionary Guards as terrorists? "
"If Trump can unilaterally declare that a group is a terrorist organization, and if he then has the power to execute “terrorists” without even notifying Congress, are there any limits on his powers at all? Or does Trump now have the right to be judge, jury, and executioner for all mankind?"
"The Quds Force was designated as a terrorist organization by executive order 13224 in October of 2007, and has been so considered by the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations."
There is nothing new or arbitrary about it.
"I just checked and you’re right; while the Revolutionary Guard was declared a terrorist group by Trump, the subsidiary Quds Force was designated a terrorist force much earlier."
"But the point still stands—if we can justify Trump killing Soleimani because our government once designated him a terrorist, and if the executive has the power to arbitrarily declare people terrorists, then is there any limit to his power?"
It's scary how uninformed everyone is.
Pretty ironic coming from you
"Now fuck off, Redcap"
"I know. They are so freaked out by their hatred of Trump they are failing to realize this was one of the most dangerous men in the world, leading an organization internationally designated as a terrorist organization for a decade, actively engaged in attacks against the US."
I'm not sure if it was a good idea to do or of how it was done. However he was a a well known terrorist organizer as designated by decades of bi partisan administration's.
We killed him without any thought as to what the consequences could be.  We could have taken the guy out in a way that gave us deniability and not jeopardize our stance in Iraq
I didn't know who the dude was until he was dead. The first thing I did when I heard was research who he was. Then reading multiple sources it was clear both sides were pushing an agenda and facts were talking a back seat.
"I just haven't formed an opinion because I don't trust most of the reporting yet. If he was in Iraq training, arming and directing action it's very different than if he was in government business. Just don't trust any of the reporting yet."
He was an Iranian general. He wasn't actively engaged in jack shit other than getting off a plane for peace talks.
"He was the leader of a designated terrorist organization, (declared in 2007, by the way), and actively known to be engaged in actions against the US."
"Therefore, legitimate military target"
"Just because something/someone can be designated by some a ""legitimate military target"", doesn't mean it's a good idea."
"Except in this case, it was a pretty good idea"
Do you think it's a good idea that we're now sending thousands more troops to the ME too? That Iran is now back on track to develop nuclear weapons? That we're threatening to hit Iranian cultural sites? That we're threatening harsher sanctions on Iraq than ever before? All those good ideas too?
"We could have had easily gotten a group of operators in a truck, arm them with PK’s and AK’s and RPGs and hit salamis land cruiser.  We could have staged his hit to look like sectarian violence and maintained deniability."
Now we’re getting kicked out of Iraq and burned bridges with them
So what
Maintain ties with Iraq by having deniability in the dude’s death.  If we’re kicked out of Iraq everything we’ve done there is for nothing.  All the soldiers killed and all the money was for nothing
We need to be out of Iraq anyways... and the middle East in general.
Wut?
"<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/ekxacz/_/fde6ebe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/ekxacz/_/fde6ebe</a>"
He's leader of a group that's labeled as a Terrorist
"He was an Iranian general. Being on a magic list doesn't change that. We, the US, have generals and intelligence officials responsible for far more deaths and atrocities than that guy ever dreamed of. If they end up on a magic list you're totally cool with other countries assassinating them, right?"
I think alot of people in the middle East would happily assassinate our officially if they could
Unilaterally designated a terrorist by the US. 
"So when Iran designates the US Marine Corps a terrorist organization, they can assassinate the USMC Commandant as a ""legitimate target?"""
I don't think they care if they labeled him a terrorist or not
"Can you please explain what a ""terrorist"" even is?"
I can explain how Qasam Soleimoni engaged in acts of terrorism.  If that works for you. Definition terrorist is silly when we can explain the victim himself as terrorizing people for politics.
Not sure America can complain mind you. But he was a terrorist.
"At the end of the day, essentially all violence is committed in the name of politics.  If that is the case, than all military organizations in the world are terrorist organizations."
essentially all violence is committed in the name of politics.
Pretty sure the robber isnt concerned with politics...
"That's why I put the weasel word ""essentially"" in there.  Globally, about half a million people are killed by violent crime every year.  Most of those people can probably be excluded from the total, though some of that tally includes ethnic and religious violence which arguably fall under the umbrella of political violence.  OTOH, 100M people were killed in WWII alone.  As you see, the sum of lethal violence attributable to warfare greatly outweighs that which results from ordinary crime.  Statistically speaking, you are many times more likely to die at the hand of a political actor than at the hand of a criminal.  If this wasn't the case, we wouldn't spend a large fraction of our GDP trying to mitigate that risk."
No one complained when he did in the ISIS moron
What does this mean?
Obama dropped 70 bombs/day during his final year as president. I don’t recall a lot of uproar about that then?
"Hmm, I recall some uproar."
I do.  I also recall Trump made those look like rookie numbers and even stopped the mandatory reporting of those numbers.
He also notified Congress to allow them to exercise their power to say they didn’t meet their definition for authority to strike.
"The United States government's job is to defend the United States. If a foreign country attacks another foreign country that's not our ally, and isn't even on our hemisphere, then we should do nothing. Americans don't have to die fighting in every war on Earth."
Countries having nuclear weapons doesn't mean we need to get involved in conflicts that have nothing to do with us. We have the best nuclear deterrent in the world. Nobody is going to nuke us because they'd be destroyed.
"We have sensors that detect radiation in big cities I believe. If not, that's a much better solution that trying to police the entire world. 9/11 was horrific, but it was still small compared to major wars. 3,000 died on 9/11 but hundreds of thousands of people have died in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Tens of millions died in WWII. Millions of people have died because of the war on drugs. It's important to realize that smoking, alcohol, heart disease, war, crime, and car accidents kill far more people than terrorism. We shouldn't act emotional and make dumb decisions because terrorism is scary. We should act logically."
Thanks for your comment.
Sure thing!
Multiple things:
The nuclear genie is out of the bottle. You cannot stop any nation from developing nuclear weapons anymore. You can delay at best and then have a nuclear armed nation that hates your guts. 
"Authoritarian nations have one major weakness: their main enemy is within. Look at how many resources are spent by authoritarian nations to monitor and control their own population. In order for an authoritarian nation to be a threat to their neighbor that neighbor would have to be either extremely weak or the tyranny has to be dialed down. In my opinion, USSR was doomed the moment it grabbed all the extra countries after WW2. "
"Dirty bombs cannot be stopped. We should just stop giving radicals an incentive. If anything, our current military policy is what is creating the threat of these terrorist attacks in the first place. How many terrorists has USA created by accidentally murdering someone's brother, sister, mother, father or child?"
"Smaller foreign powers always have the option of coming together to present a stronger front. Europe is effectively impregnable, yet consists of many tiny little nations. "
History books are your friend. Empires and tyrannies are not sustainable in the long term.
Thank you for the break down.
No problem. I am not libertarian by the way and I do not support full isolationism. USA's large military has provided USA with great economic benefits but we cannot stop the inevitable.
"I'm going to be that guy and correct your word choice. You mean <em>authoritarian</em>, not authoritative. One has a positive connotation, the other a negative one."
Thanks. I just made the edits.
I would support American billionaires using their wealth to hire mercenaries to invade any of those countries.  
What they do after that in those countries is none of my business.
"I'm of the personal opinion that we should avoid direct conflict with these nations, as there is no reason to send young men overseas to die over nations that are none of our concern. "

"These regimes tend to collapse from within if left to their own devices anyway, as they consume ridiculous amounts of resources to suppress dissent. Though I will add that I am opposed to them in the sense that they have zero regard for human rights."
He's an important public figure. The same reason they don't ban Trump for threatening war crimes and shit.
"Are you a statist? Genuinely, we are all important, or none of us are. Twitter is a leftist organization, that's why he was left there and she was banned."
"And why haven't they banned Trump if they're unfairly picking on conservatives? Hell, Richard Spencer hasn't been banned."
"You guys give them too much credit, money is the only reason they ban/not ban somebody. I'm sure they simply count how many ""followers"" they gain/loose in each case."
Edited: typo
Is the Iranian Twitter user base really large enough for that logic to be sound?
IDK I work elsewhere
Spencer is controlled opposition. He literally has never achieved anything meaningful.
"Using the flawed logic of him being important. Plus, it would cause a first ammendment case that wouldn't go in twitters favor if that happened."
Trump isn't important?
"He is important, the flawed logic of the person that says some people are more important than others..."

"Probably for the same reason they don't ban Trump for being a blatant racist, or intimidation, or bullying, or threatening abuse of his office."
"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — <em>The city of Philadelphia has agreed to pay $4.15 million to a man who spent 24 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit, one of the largest such payouts in city history.</em>"
"<em>City officials agreed last week to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed by Shaurn Thomas, who was 20 when he was convicted of second-degree murder in a 1990 robbery and killing. He received an automatic life sentence.</em>"
Norway does something I really like. There is no life sentence. The maximum sentence is 21 years and if you are still dangerous after that sentence is served you stay in prison. I can't help but think the Norwegian system would have caught this or would have actually cared to have caught it in the first place.
and if you are still dangerous after that sentence is served you stay in prison.
That doesn't sound abusable at all...
"Every system is abusable. Hence the extreme sentences given in America. The murderer of the communist youth campers will never be free despite his initial sentence while someone who committed a horrible crime that while still horrible was less so, will be able to rejoin society if they can show rehabilitation. Otherwise they'd all be stuck for life."
"America would just classify these people ""dangerous"" is my point. And also anyone they didn't like."
They've tried mental lockdown for life with heinous people who got off before.
I don't know what the best system is. I dislike sex offenders and felons still being punished after they leave prison. My mindset is if they were still dangerous then they should have been kept in prison rather than be let free as second class citizens. 
"I agree with you fully that America would use this to punish dissidents, but they already do with the current system.  Curtis Flowers of Mississippi was held 22 years and tried six times for the same crime. And that's just a citizen. What occurs in Guantanamo is much worse."

Of course Trump will sign that into law

"It effects trump negatively, so he'll veto it."
Could just be me but I was sensing some sarcasm...
They had a few years during the Obama presidency to limit the executive branch if they were so worried about executive overreach. They only care when the shoe is on the other foot
Didnt Obama even go so far as to veto some limits on drone strikes?
Wouldn't surprise me but I don't 100% know
He carried out more drone strikes in a year than Trump has entire presidency so I wouldn't doubt it.
"Well that's a crock of shit. Trump has exceeded Obama's total drone strike count. <a href=""https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/5/8/18619206/under-donald-trump-drone-strikes-far-exceed-obama-s-numbers"">Source</a>"
"Even if Obama had used drone strikes more than Trump, Trump overturned an Obama era-rule on transparency, providing an annual report on the use of drone strikes so we won't have any idea how many he uses during the rest of his presidency.

Seems like this article is long-winded piece to lie by omission of that very fact.
"they've been steady expanding power, i dont think they expected trump to win. they assume'd h-dawg would have all that power right now..."
Do you support the legislation?
To limit executive overreach in general? Absolutely. Do I think they're actually going to do anything positive here? No.
What’s not positive about this?
"That it's just putting on a show? It's gonna get shelved in the Senate and they know it. Just like when the opposite was true and Republicans voted to repeal ""Obamacare"" a bunch of times only to not do it once they had the chance."
Of course it doesn’t address the root issue of Congress acceding authority.
Isn't the house ran by neocon repulsivecans?
I agree with Pelosi. I never thought I'd write that sentence.

"Umm, no. They wear it as a status symbol. You can't visit a pawn shop once you've been arrested."
Bling actually started out as bail money. It was generally safe from confiscation by cops would would take all their cash.
Now it's just a status symbol
From the Pawn Star guy in an NPR interview:
"“And who buys the jewelry from Harrison? Pimps — and there's a good reason why. ""When you get arrested for pandering, they take your cash — because the cash was obtained illegally — but they don't take away your jewelry,"" Harrison explains. ""And a pimp knows that if he buys jewelry in a pawn shop, if [he] brings it back to a pawn shop and gets a loan against it, [they'll] always get half of what you paid for it — as opposed to buying it in a jewelry store, when [they] don't know what [they're] going to get. <strong>So, when they get arrested, they will always have someone bring their jewelry down to me. I will loan them half of what they paid for it — and that's their bail money</strong>."""

This is probably the dumbest thing I've read in the last few days
"Gold is deflationary, people hold onto it because it increases in value but that means people don't want to use it as a medium of exchange. In the 19th century bankers used to promote the gold standard because they held most of the gold and it was increasing in value. Deflation is basically is a welfare subsidy for people who hold gold. If you read  The Law of Civilization and Decay by Brook Adams he points out that the gold standard was a major cause (though not the only one) for the fall of the Roman Empire. Inflation can be a problem too but it's not as big a threat as libertarians make it out to be. The most famous hyperinflation in history, Germany in the 1920's was very predictable given the reparations and the fact that Germany was stripped of most of it's manufacturing territories by the Treaty of Versailles. John Maynard Keynes wrote a book predicting it."
"Brook Adams was also a critic of capitalism, wasn’t he?"
"That's correct, he was more of a conservative populist. He supported more of an agrarian society."
Gold is pretty much a useless metal. It only became somewhat useful recently. Does it really matter if we base our currencies' value on some random metal or what we have now. 
"Ultimately, gold standard does not change a thing. A country that buys more than it sells will end up with a less valuable currency as their gold deposits start to disappear. All gold standard would do is artificially inflate the value of currencies of countries like switzerland who stockpile the damned thing."
Full blown retarded
"You may not necessarily like fiat based currency, but it's pretty universally agreed that the gold standard is retarded for tons of reasons"
I like all the reasons you listed
"First of all, don't listen to Retardican.  He's a known tankie and Chapo troll, and likely an alt account of another Chapo shitbag, PutinPaysTrump, who got banned from here.  The head mod of this sub, Elranzer, is a known Chapo and tankie sympathizer, and another one of the mods openly calls Chapos to brigade this sub."
"Retards like him think the government can just print money endlessly with no repercussions.  I'm not even joking--it's called ""Modern Monetary Theory,"" and it says that if the government uses fiat currency, then the government has theoretically unlimited buying power because they can just print more currency."
"It's a line of thinking used by historically illiterate retards, which is why Chapos like Retardican love it so much.  They just want to follow in their socialist forefathers' footsteps and collapse this country into poverty and famine so they can grab power.  That's their goal."
"Gold may not necessarily be the only metal we could use (a silver standard would also work), but our money <em>needs</em> to be pegged to a physical substance or our economy will eventually collapse."
"Wow, you sound like a dangerously brainwashed fuck up"
"Lol, you think you matter.  Hilarious."
"Well duh. Of course he assumed his dead dead brother’s identity, this is one of the normal steps to take when one divorces one’s wife to move in on one’s dead dead brother’s widow"
Isolationism is when a country is completely closed off to the rest of the word like Japan was for about 200 years. They had little to no trade trade with with the rest of the word and had closed boarders. Non interventionism is not getting involed in other peoples wars and leaving other countries to their own devices. The US got labeled isolationist for initially not wanting to get involved in WW1 and WW2 as a way to demonize neutrality.
The correct wordage for what you are trying to label a librarian ideal is anti interventionalism. Very different than isolationism
"Isolationism and non-interventionism are not the same thing. Isolationism results in closed borders, no international trade or high tariffs if there is any trade. Non-interventionism results in an almost disregard for the internal politics of other countries. We don’t want to get involved in their affairs, and we’d rather that they didn’t get involved in ours. We’d love to trade with you but we’d rather ignore your problems and you reciprocate"
"Quite honestly i don’t even know how to Answer this, so if this is not the answer you needed then sorry... libertarianism and isolationism while close in definition are quite different in use.. isolationist country might not want to interfere in other countries affairs but can have a statist society(ex: Japan)... isolationism is not adopted by libertarian societies mainly because free markets and open trade is what makes limited government countries successful... you might be able to get away with calling a limited government country an isolationist when in reference to wars. It’s part of libertarian ideology not to be involved in other countries war affairs.. libertarians are against regime change because they aren’t effective and create more problems."
So no libertarians aren’t isolationist...
Two thoughts:
"1) I think this is a mixing of terms issue - ""isolationism"" generally implies not just non-intervention but also non-globalization (i.e. closed borders, tighter international markets) which libertarians tend to be against."
"2) While you're probably right that the ideals lean towards individuation and isolationism, I'd suspect that there's a rather large contingent (myself included) who're rather pro-globalization and the like. I'm not pro-intervention, per se, but I think there's some obligation on the level of the state as it exists now to diplomatically pressure (not really a fan of military intervention) other states into more democratic forms of governance that allow individuals more political and economic freedoms."
noninterventionism is very different than isolationism.
"Our founders warned of 'estranged and entangling foreign affairs.' If that means looking 'isolationist' in the modern globalist era, then so be it. I dont like the UN and other such organizations. To many this equates to 'isolationism.'"
"Isolationism is inherent to libertarianism, but it depends on the individual’s view on defensive pacts, as such things can forcibly bring you into war."
"You’re not wrong, people on this sub have just gotten less libertarian"
"Don’t worry, this is just further proof that The Golden Don is doing his best to stop a war with Iran. /s"
Such a retard................... I swear.
How did he block it?
Same way he has blocked any/everyone that even hints at maybe discussing the war crimes of the US. He said he will revoke the Visa's of any such persons that tries to go to the UN with any such information.
"This was like 2017 I think, maybe 18."
"Wow, we come off as so fucken petty in the Trump era."
I don't understand why Iran or Russia are my enemies. The handful of Persians and Russians I've met were all pleasant people.
I met a lot of nice Afghans while deployed. 
I also met a lot of people in Afghanistan that wanted to kill us too. 
Not all Americans are obese.
I also met a lot of people in Afghanistan that wanted to kill us too. 
I can't really blame them
"I can't wait to listen to all the statists in here screaming about drumpf interfering with the operations of the biggest globalist joke in the world, the UN."
Good thing they put yellow bands on you lots...easier to confirm what is already obvious.
Libertarians are pro drugs and pro abortion. You can't even get the basic politics right before you strawman. This is pathetic.
Seems it is you who You can't even get the basic politics right before you strawman...speaking of pathetic.
"Libertarians arent pro abortion or pro drugs....Libertarians are pro rights, something you fail to understand being the devoted ""drumpflican"" that you are."
you should have that Leftist Derangement Syndrome looked at...it seems to consume you.
"I was going to say ""that aged poorly"" but it's a little more complex than that.  Many of the particular points the article made were more or less true.  Jordan and Saudi Arabia, in particular, are largely no different than they were.  But it completely whiffed on Mubarak and totally misidentified the actual potential threats to Turkey by focusing on the Kurds - specifically, Islamist insurgencies first and itself second."
"Ultimately the fundamental problem with the article is that it looks at US intervention and military action purely through a statecraft lens - how will our actions affect the functions and interactions of regional state apparatuses, with an occasional side glance toward whether broadly defined population groups are likely to stage an organized popular uprising."
And his opinion on Trump.
"You can both agree and disagree with someone. It's not zero sum. Same goes for Trump, Obama, Churchill or any other person. He slaughtered Hollywood last night and they deserved every bit of it."
"That's his shtick. Its not just last night. Hollywood loves roasting themselves. And of course you can agree and disagree with someone. Rick Gervais destroys Trump and his fans, probably more often then he pokes fun at his coworkers."
That wasn't a roast that was the heat of a thousands Suns. He really wasn't kidding and meant every word. He'll kind of play cutesy but he was serious and they needed that. I hope it sinks in for them that working class people are tired of their self righteousness and hypocrisy.
And good sometimes Trump needs to be held accountable. It's a shame his ego gets the best of him but I'll take him over that shit show in the Democratic party right now any time. What a hot mess.
"Look I didn't vote Trump in 16, I voted Johnson. But I'm voting Trump in 20 unless someone really good comes along that can win."
"The left is fucking nuts right now, Bernie Sanders? Are they kidding? AOC? Ilhan Omar? No fucking way. 2020 is too important to let those lunatics in. 2024 we'll see what happens and I truly hope there's room for a viable 3rd party."
"That's what this is really the framework for. People like gervais or Chapelle or many others reaching moderates that are tired of the far periphery. It's becoming possible to call all of them out for the nonsense, the government waste, the federal overreach, PC culture, completely destroying individual freedoms. Social media can bypass the left media and reach both left and right for consensus."
So called libertarians need to stop being so snobbish about Trump voters. Trump is very clearly not perfect and I hope he takes his win on the assassination and let's Iran stew without starting a war. Many are just completely pissed at the Dems and cannot stand the idea of socialism. Libertarianism crosses into many different political circles and needs to be more welcoming to stand a chance of flourishing. Right now it's seem as extreme on the left and not viable on the right.
"I don't know if I will vote for Trump in 2020, but like you, I voted for Johnson in 2016 and where did that get us? Absolutely nowhere."
"Has the LP even announced any worthy Libertarian candidates to run in 2020? Nope. Also, what you are saying is 100%- the left (along with Democrats) have absolutely lost their minds and I have made the claim for a long time that there is more to fear from radicals on the left than radicals on the right."
The right has a tendency to just leave you alone if they disagree. By and large not the Fringe. The left will just fucking try to shame you to death for not agreeing. It's sickness.
I'm dubious the libertarian party will put up a candidate that can take votes from Trump. The threat of socialism is far more serious than his antics. This socialist movement is a real threat not just to libertarianism but to everyone. I'm hoping the libertarians generate steam for 2024.
2016 was the last realistic shot and almost got 5% in a number of influence states. I don't know about other states but in Minnesota it makes it a legitimate contender the following election.
"I'd argue that the left has a tendency to leave you alone and let you practice the religion of your choosing, or get an abortion if you choose, while the right is all about forcing christianity on as much of the populace as they legally can."
"Probably depends on the issue. The right will go after you about abortion hard but the left will do anything to eliminate gun rights. The right, in my area, is very relaxed about gay rights the left is off the wall on social justice issues. Just depends 8 guess."
In my experience it's been right moderates than tend to live and let live but I'm from Minnesota and the left is fucking bonkers here.
Who has the Right forced to be Christian? America has a long classically liberal (libertarian conservative) tradition of freedom of religion.
"Yeah, I know, sometimes they make laws based on their values which are different from your values. But other than abortion, where they are anti-choice, it's the Left that is anti-choice in every single other area."
ever see a <em>left winger</em> throw a fit about something other than a Christian invocation being given before a political or public event?
I've seen many right-wingers do so. And you can forget about running for office as anything but a Christian or New if you're a Republican
Sheesh
I have made the claim for a long time that there is more to fear from radicals on the left than radicals on the right.
"While I might agree with you, at this point in time in the US, this is the case...  I would not hold this as a general rule for all times and scenarios."
"There certainly have been in the past, and almost certainly will be again in the future, points in time where the radical right is <strong><em>far</em></strong> more dangerous than the radical left."
"To be clear tho,  I <em>do</em> agree with you, that at <strong>this</strong> point in the US, the radical left is much more dangerous than the radical right."
This is empirically false.
ORLY? Do tell.

"Your thesis is that right-wing terrorism is the most important issue right now? It's miniscule. Crime from the war on drugs alone is 1,000 times as bad. And that's just one issue among dozens of issues that are more important."
When the facts are against you pound the table.
That's some good table pounding.
If you'd like to correct your ibjectively inaccurate statement I applaud you.
If not then business as usual
I keep hearing that far right attacks are on the rise- but we also know for a fact that far left attacks have been on the rise as well. 
"I'll ask you this, what is more damaging: A few racist pieces of shit who call themselves Republicans who the Republican party has condemned or a bunch of far left socialists who the Democratic party has openly embraced?"
we also know for a fact that far left attacks have been on the rise as well.

"I am not going to do your research for you, but just look at far left radical groups such as ANTIFA, Black Lives Matters etc. My friend (who I have known for 20 years) and sister in law actually went to Berkley (and graduated) and every time there was a conservative speaker, ANTIFA would show up, protests and attack conservatives- this is pretty well documented and it has been happening in other cities as well (Portland and in Seattle)."
Let's also not forget the assassination attempt on Republican congressman Steve Scalise in 2017.
"Most of the news outlets are part of the left so you will rarely see MSNBC, CNN, NPR, Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times etc. reporting this stuff. I am not trying to dismiss right wing extremists, but unlike the major leftists news outlets, I am not going to simply sweep far left violence under the rug simply because the leftist news outlets are failing to report it."

"I'm doing exactly the same thing. Strategically, the most important thing in America is that socialists don't take power. If conservatives are in power and pass a few stupid laws making online gambling harder to do, that's a shame. At least they won't destroy the entire economic system."
"With demographic changes favoring the Democrats and the Left, we're going to have to ally with conservatives to keep them out of power. If the libertarian movement is strong enough, we should be able to have a large influence as a big part of that coalition."
You're fucking batshit crazy.
Very elegant and well thought out response. Fucking dimwit
He literally says at the beginning of his monologue that it's all just jokes and good fun.
"Let’s go out with a bang, let’s have a laugh at your expense. Remember, they’re just jokes. We’re all gonna die soon and there’s no sequel, so remember that."
"And you come back with the ""heat of a thousand suns""? You're fucking crazy. It was jokes with HIS friends and peers."
"He was being sarcastic, tongue and cheek and cutesy like I said. Say whatever you want he meant it."
You said roast I picked a different analogy relative to the venue. Never has an awards show been called out that fiercely for that long. It was wonderful. He upped the ante quite a bit. 
But hey whatever read it back in robo text to yourself maybe it'll lose all it's connotation and therefore meaning. Whatever makes you feel better.
They are HIS friends and peers. He's a comedian. It was all sarcastic and cutesy. You're the one making yourself feel better. 
"I enjoyed the hell out of it. It was fantastic self reflection and comedy. It's not the ""heat of a thousand suns"". He flies on private jets. He attends parties with them. It's comedy."
"Whatever like I said focus on whatever you want. U think I went too far, fine whatever. Like Ricky gervais I don't care and this is my last time so here it is..."
"And he's not friends with all of them. A lot if they are just competition. Calling out Tim Cook? What could get possibly gain from that? The Joe pesci thing was a joke obviously but the the Apple thing wasn't. Netflix, Amazon and apple are a big part if the future of entertainment."
Telling them to shut the fuck up and accept their award humbly wasn't a joke. It wasn't even funny really but it was so honest it was refreshing and it was just really clear that it would be well received by a lot of people who weren't in that room. I'm glad he said it but they weren't. Whatever fuck them anyway.
And just bc he called out Hollywood doesn't mean he can't call out Trump or religious fanatics. Trump fucks up a lot too so does the church. 
Really what's your point? That this was just a game? No harm done? He said some things that could end lesser known people careers. Maybe his.
Those evangelicals are master cherry pickers though
"According to conservatives only idiots listen to celebrities, oh wait, this one said things I like, post it all over!"
Ricky is consistently great
Agreed but i do think his monologue was kinda weak last night. He take on trans people and specifically Kaitlyn Jenner was hilarious a few years back
"You can call it relatively weak, and that has to be compared to his older stuff. He crushes the other comedians"
You look foolish when you assert that only religious people are conservative. Myself and most of my buddies are both conservative and atheist.

"It just futher reiterates the disconnect and delusion on the left. They believe that, because the press, Hollywood, television, social media, and their party, paint an image of conservatives  being a bunch of racist, old fashion jesus freaks, stuck in the 50s, that it's the case. "
"It's this disconnect that has them losing, as well as looking batshit. They don't understand the modern day conservative movement, because they dont look beyond their propaganda bubble. They hardly think with their own minds, because if they did, they would be a lot more skeptical of the democratic party. A little more skeptical of socialism. They are easily manipulated, so people in power take advantage of that."
"The funny thing is they think conservatives are just as brainwashed, living in a bubble, not looking or listening to the other side. Which is fucking hilarious, because with the modern day leftists media, as well as the social media brigade, spewing out anti trump nonsense everywhere you turn, ""conservatives"" couldn't stay in a bubble if they tried. However it is very easy to stay isolated in a leftist bubble. Is all you have to do is not turn on fox news! Lol. Conservative however?? Not so easy. You literally cannot escape it. "
"But conservatives are in their bubbles, oblivious to what's going on!? Lol👌"
"Great point. Libertarians and Republicans are forced to hear Leftist points of view all the time, whether in school, the media, or from corporate HR. It's unavoidable. We've heard what you have to say endlessly and reject it completely."
"Someone should do a study on ""openness to new ideas"" that studies how much Republicans expose themselves to Leftist ideas and how much Democrats expose themselves to right-wing ideas. I'm sure you'll find Republicans have lots of exposure, while Democrats have almost none."
Loved the shit about Epstein
I think its conservatives anti-hollywood agenda as most of California is democrat/liberal which actors tend to speak out against the current administration.  So when anyone shits on hollywood they tend to back it.
"Conservatives do not think he is on our side! We are just happy hes calling out the bullshit, same as you. The fact that non-conservatives think we only like people on our side is a projection of your own mind."
"His speech reminded me of that South Park episode where ""Reality"" crashes the party with his brutally honest words."
"I just love how the left criticizes Ricky Gervais for punching down in his jokes, especially his last special. So now he punches “up” and all the leftist media condemn him for bullying Hollywood. Give me a break! XD"
"I think you overestimate how many young conservatives base who they are fans of in regards to religion
Mass - almost exclusively catholic voting demturds 
South east sans florida - baptists and evangelicals who have a strong chance of voting left.
Wisconsin - where it goes bar, bar, autoshop, church
I lean to the right.  My favorite band is pearl jam.  Eddie Vedder is a typical lefty.  I still listen to his music."
Why does it have to be binary?
"Is it even the conservatives though? I feel like it's same old people who mainly identify as right-wing, rather than purely ideological conservatives, and take whatever position that they think makes the left angry. They would torture their grandmas if it triggered the libs."
I know personally that if I disagree with even one thing someone thinks then I can't praise literally anything they say ever.
"I was about to say, isn’t he a pretty staunch atheist?"
"Yeah,  I was banned from the conservative sub for  agreeing that civil laws based on Muslim beliefs were wrong,  because I also extended that to include laws based solely on Christian beliefs.  Or suggesting that those with extreme views of both religions agree on more that they disagree on."
Treaty of Tripoli
That and southern strategy gets them riled up.
"he's also an anti-gun douche, so stop sucking his dick soo much."
as a conservative i dont need to agree with his oppinions on religion to enjoy a good slapping. his monologue highlighted a lot of the things that bothered me about celebrities in hollywood.
"I’ve found that <a href=""/r/conservatives"" rel=""nofollow"">r/conservatives</a> aren’t actually conservative (not surprising). They claim to hate big government but like deficit spending when it’s for the military and government enforcing their theocracy. When you point that out you’re a libtard. I was banned because i used a derogatory term (I admittedly used the term dago when using their reasoning to ban Hispanics immigrants from coming to America and apply it to Italian immigration from the early 20th century) but that’s not the actual reason I was banned. They didn’t like reasoning."

You're right :( deep down I hate myself

He is correct. This is the permanent state at work here.
Shame he's been picking trump's boots on russian state media for the last 2 years.
Too little too late Ron

Trump is staying in Iraq and threatened sanctions on Iraq that he claims will make Iran’s sanctions look tame if they force US into leaving.
Shut the absolute fuck up. Trump just clearly said he would sanction Iraq if they forced our troops out. 
Trump has no fucking idea what he's doing. One minute we ditch the Kurds the next minute we literally sell our soldiers as mercenaries for Saudi Arabia then by the time he's done screaming at the TV he's pledging war crimes.
"Wow, so a proposed deal gets her porker of the year but increasing the deficit and bailing out farmer to the tune of billions is just ignored. Gotta love republican propaganda."
Very fair
China tariffs paid our farmers. Check mate
Sarcasm?
Fact
So the 25% tariff wasn’t passed on to the consumers in the US? Are you actually trying to say that Chyna absorbed the 25% tariff?
No it absolutely wasn’t we have basically zero inflation you little cuck.
Redhat cult member. I should have guessed. 
Maybe get Trumps cock out of you mouth and educate yourself.

I bet he takes a picture of his dick and sends it as the justification.
Which would be hilarious.
I got your medium range intercontinental ballistic missile right here but your mama call’s it a global phenomenon!
"If you told me “hey, this guy is lying during a lot of his campaign speeches, but he’s going to send a dick pic to congress when they ask for evidence. Also wants to create a space force to shoot aliens and shit” I’m voting for that guy 10/10 times. That’s about as anti-libertarian as it gets, but I’m into humor more then politics and wouldn’t be able to quit laughing."
The best thing this man has done is devalue the office
Right there with you. Funny as hell
IMO if the DNC had picked anyone other than Hillary it would be a different story. She is someone that I will never vote for ever. She is everything that is wrong with our government and l do not regret voting for Trump instead of the cuntosaurus called Hillary.
"Vague ""Hillary is the devil"" comments are fucking everywhere without specific reasons why you hate her so much. It's because that view has been conditioned into you over a couple decades of propaganda/smear campaign. "
"Disagree with policy all you want, but this whole building her up as the ultimate evil is just pathetic and it's led many idiots into believing shit like Pizzagate and QAnon."
"'I have been told, by many man large men, that i have the biggest penis ever, its YuGE they say. Look folks, its geneitic, my dad had a very large penis.'"
"I've got to admit, it would be hilarious at first."
You would laugh every time you thought about it for years. Don’t you give me this “at first”. You’d be sitting at a funeral biting your tongue so you don’t laugh if you thought about it.
"No it's definitely at first. The problem is while I find shitposting like that funny, it is definitely not the way I want our government to work and would be deeply concerning. "
Plus the waste of taxpayer money spent on the telephoto lense.
"Super funny!!! Oh man, it is great when the president sends dick pics instead of his justification for murdering a couple people and usurping congressional powers!!! So fucking funny!!!! Libtards eat that shit right???!! Fucking asshat."
Nothing to do with liberals or conservatives. Anybody in a presidential position that did that would be hilarious. Lighten up troll.
"If he’s a troll, does that mean you’ll support him for president? Being an asshole and a piece of shit is apparently your only requirement."
Nah. That ain’t funny. You’re just a child. Grow up kid.
Likely won’t measure up
Who wants to bet that you are a paid shill?
Who wants to bet that you have trump Derangement syndrome.
"And thus, a new troll account is born."
It's the same posting pattern as two or three other usernames recently.  
"Always starts with ""lol"" and ends in emojis."
"And thus, nobody cares what you have to say. You nerd. Lol 😂"
You made an account to post that?
"Don’t cry, you little bitch. Lol 😂"
"Oh, you’re just another alt. You’re pathetic."
Funny feed them.
Pot calling the kettle black. Lol 😂 
Take it easy you moron.
Thanks for proving me right.
Lol. You are clueless. 😂
The leftists on this sub are dumb dumbs. 🤣🤣🤣
"No, but you pretty obviously are. Even the other conservatives here hate you."
Not a conservative. Try again. Lol 😂 
Shows how clueless you hysterical leftists are. Complete idiots.
TDS is a propaganda term.
Who wants to bet that you have Trump Attachment Syndrome.  See how easy it is.
"Also, lol at you for making and account for this comment."
You are a propaganda account. With Trump Derangement syndrome Lol 😂 
Fuck Trump too. 
See how easy it is when you’re a libertarian and not a leftists moron. 
Try harder. 🤣🤣🤣
TDS is a propaganda term.
"No moreso than ""Okay Boomer"".  He's misusing it though.  TDS is when you turn every conversation into how much you hate Trump."
"Like if I talk about how I'm angry and sad that Julian Assange is in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day for the crime of being a whistleblower, there's always one person who tries to justify it by crying about Trump and Ze Russians, as if that's not literally McCarthyism."
"Or like how the S&amp;P shaker sizes made headlines, or like two scoop gate, or like how CNN buried the story about the Syrian gas attack to talk about how Trump eats fried chicken with a fork and knife."
It's propaganda and used to shut down conversation.  If people weren't divided government would be scared shitless.
I'm not sure why you're talking about Okay Boomer or all the other Trump stuff.
used to shut down conversation.
It's used to shut down derailing whataboutism.  
I want to talk about X.  You reply that you want to talk about Trump instead of X.  That's what TDS is.
"I post something negative of Trump in this case ""Trump urged to declassify justification for Soleimani killing in letter from Democrat leaders""
and then get accused of TDS because I said he's probably not going to release justification."
Everytime i see the term used it's by someone trying to shut down conversation.  It's pure propaganda and future textbooks will have it as an example of such.
Then correct them that they're misusing their own meme.
"It's like when you people call 30 year olds ""boomers""."
"You know people used to say ""Bush Derangement Syndrome"" about people who opposed the Iraq war."
"Yeah, nothing ever changes.  Make America Great Again was a Reagan slogan."
Which means he won't do it.
"I'm surprised the Democrats haven't just tried to reverse psychology him, it'd probably work."
Trump:
Vile DEMONRATS think i won't release my reason! Here it is! What stable genius I am! Bigly smart military commander in chief!
You're assuming they actually want him to release it instead of just puffing their chests for the media.
If I had to guess it's because the army group that Soleimani was the leader of supported the forces of a recognized terrorist organisation. At least that seems like a valid enough reason.
But how does that make Trump look bad and Iran look good?
"Killing someone never makes someone look good. Absolutely not. But the thing that Iran as a country has so much terrorism in it, as far as I'm concerned, that killing a guy who directly works with a recognized terrorist organization is accetable."
recognized terrorist organisation
recognized...unilaterally by the US
"So when Iran declares the US Marine Corps as a terrorist organization, they're free to assassinate the USMC Commandant?"
"Well actually it's Israel, Saudi-Arabia, Canada and the USA. But I think they're free to do whatever the fuck they want, not like it's effecting me personally. Just would make me like them less."
Isn’t the justification that he leads an organization determined to be terrorist
"Soleimani's death makes the world a significantly better and safer place. Soleimani was responsible for the killing of hundreds of American troops in Iraq (by State Department estimates, 17 percent of all Americans killed in Iraq were Soleimani’s handiwork), the arming of Hezbollah in Lebanon with tens of thousands of rockets, the Houthi terrorism in Yemen, the building of Islamic Jihad, and a bevy of terror plots all around the world, including the latest assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Speculation that this represents an “act of war” is utterly baseless — Soleimani is a terrorist who was killed while abroad, in Iraq, planning further acts of terrorism."
"Suggestions that the Trump administration is responsible for “escalation” with Iran — after months of Iranian aggression in international waters and in foreign countries, after downing an American drone and attacking an American embassy — are absurd and morally disgusting. When Nancy Pelosi tweets that it is “disproportionate” to kill a terror leader planning action against Americans and our assets and allies, she’s not just reflecting moral confusion — she’s evidencing moral foolishness of the highest order."
Literally copy/pasting Ben Shapiro 
"<a href=""https://www.dailywire.com/news/shapiro-trump-taking-out-soleimani-just-made-the-world-a-better-safer-place"">https://www.dailywire.com/news/shapiro-trump-taking-out-soleimani-just-made-the-world-a-better-safer-place</a>"
Show me any evidence for what you are saying that doesn't come from the exact same organization and people that said Iraq had WMD's.
that doesn't come from the exact same organization and people that said Iraq had WMD's
A dude from Iraq who fled to Germany and claimed to have worked in an Iraqi chemical plant producing WMDs?
I would not put it past the CIA to now say that guy also personally shot down the U.S. drones on orders from the Iranian generals.
And what percentage of deaths of Iraq citizens in the region is the US responsible for?
To add to your point Dick Chaney and his lies are responsible for 100% of American deaths in Iraq. Why dosen't Trump drop a bomb on him next time he lands at JFK.
Or how about any CIA director in say the past 50 years? How many innocent civilian deaths in forign countries has the CIA been responsible for since it's creation?
And what percentage of deaths from Terrorism is Islam responsible for?
How many deaths is Christianity responsible for? Ever heard of the Troubles? The Crusaders? The Inquisition?
What's the number one cause of terrorism in the US right now?
"Honestly, is your account like a talking points accumulator?"
"Trump is the bully on the school playground who doesn't understand the rules of chess so when he gets flustered and confused he lashes out, destroying the chess board and punching another kid. "
"Our president is so stupid he can't think ahead with anything, he sees what is in front of him and thinks nothing of consequences two or three steps down the line. He doesn't think announcing potential war crimes on Twitter is a crime, yet alone stupid as hell. He doesn't understand indiscriminately bombing a sovereign nation to take out an 'enemy' is stupid. The man is so far outside his comfort zone it is endangering every single person here and around the world."
It's not our place to get involved in the Middle East but I do find it funny that people are openly defending Iran in this timeline.
"True test would be if Trump took out a Saudi general, would people flock to defending their Regime as well? Nothing wrong with denouncing the President's actions but anyone who thinks Iran is a victim is fucking retarded."
"Thoughts <a href=""/u/AGuineaPigs"" rel=""nofollow"">u/AGuineaPigs</a>? Is Iran in the right?"
We shouldn't be fucking around in the middle east if that wasn't apparent from our adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan.
I think you are confusing people who are against war in the middle east as somehow supporters of terrorists. Same shit happened last time.  You're either with us or against us.
"You dodged the question but that's okay, I don't expect much from you. You're on <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a> where any Libertarian worth their salt is truly anti-war."
"We know you're against the President initiating the attack, I'm curious to know what you think of the target."
"He wasn't dodging the question, your question is irrelevant to the topic. He was making it clear that people aren't saying ""Iran is in the right"", they are saying we shouldn't be getting involved with the Middle East and starting pointless wars there, as per Afghanistan and Iraq."
"Whether Iran is ""in the right"" is irrelevant."
I don't remember asking you a god damn thing.
"You're posting on a public forum, dumbass. If you want to have a private discussion then send him a DM"
"Or, I can ask him a question on the thread he started since he's the poster and not give a shit when his little sheeple respond in his stead."
"AGuineaPigs is a propagandist who posts 10+ topics a day for the last 5 months, I think he's more than capable of answering for himself."
"You're really so oblivious to other peoples opinion that you see any form of disagreement as some sort of ""sheeple"" conspiracy? Get over yourself. If your argument stands, it doesn't matter who's responding. Learn how forums work, you're on one."
"It's like reading a ""how dare you comment on my FB post"" moment but on Reddit. How odd."
You still going? Thought I made it clear I don't give a fuck what you have to say.
Look at the big brain on Brett.
openly defending Iran in this timeline.
"Libertarians should be quick to defend the sovereignty of another nation (philosophically, not militarily)"
Makes it harder when that nation does not respect the sovereignty of others.
"No, it doesn't.  Libertarians should be against foreign interventionism.  That means <em>specifically</em> not intervening when another nation's sovereignty is threatened unless specifically asked for assistance."
Libertarians should be quick to defend the sovereignty of another nation
Then
That means specifically not intervening when another nation's sovereignty is threatened unless specifically asked for assistance.
Except libertarians should <em>not</em> be quick to defend the sovereignty of another nation.  Cause that's basically the definition of foreign interventionism.  Which libertarians rather explicitly oppose.
You might want to clarify yourself up there since it’s your quote.
libertarians should be quick to defend the sovereignty of another nation
"I meant philosophically, not militarily."
This is the danger of having a text-based conversation over the course of three hours.
"No worries, if you edit it to clarify then no harm no foul.  "
"The original reply remains. Being quick to defend Iran’s sovereignty is hard when they do not respect the sovereignty of others, like having their troops stationed in Kurdish and Sunni Syria, attacking Kurds in Iraq and stationed in Iraq, attacking Americans who are working on repairing electric lines, attacking their own citizens."
"If we should be quick to defend sovereignty, then it’s difficult to point out how Iran deserves what they deny others, even though both deserve it... So long as they aren’t killing people."
"And if Americans are hired to repair electrical lines in other countries, and they get murdered, and you know who the murderer is but that person refuses extradition... then what do libertarians say?"
"""It is critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner,"" the pair wrote. "
This might be the first time I've ever seen the excuse 'it's a matter of national security' used to justify <em>declassifying</em> documents.
It's getting harder to tell anymore if this is more corrupt political theater or if they are really that dumb they don't understand the justification for taking out murderous psychopaths.
"Yeah, president xi next, no further justification or risk analysis needed"
<em>Nice try Lao Che.</em>
i wouldnt oppose that. they are doing Nazi shit over there. betwen literal genocide and organ harvesting i think we have a moral duty to stop that. 
but hey im liberal more than libertarian.
"True, it can be hard to tell because thinking beyond 'he's a bad' requires <a href=""https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/"">2nd or 3rd order thinking</a> which takes effort and can be difficult."
"...so like spoilers, the justification is shooting down a US military aircraft, attacking US ships, and the last straw was attacking the US Embassy."
"Like... ""He's literally on a terrorist watchlist published by the EU"" isn't enough for you.  That's insane."
I suppose from the perspective of someone not engaging in 2nd or 3rd order thinking the conclusions and opinions derived in such ways might seem insane.
That's a solid insult!  Almost obfuscates the fact that you are defending literal terrorists.
Thanks
So you're ok with say Gen Patraeus being assassinated?
And are you that dumb to understand that the guy was an iranian high official who did all those things as part of his official job ? Or are you that trapped in your kinder-garden logic that you fail to see the bigger picture and the ramification of such action ?
I'm dumb enough to know about the Nuremberg trials and the complete rejection of this lame defense by all decent people of the world.  I just feel bad that lack of education and indoctrination couldn't spare you from spouting such ignorance.  Don't worry the entire regime will be paying the price very soon.
So you know about the Nuremberg trials and fail to see the hypocrisy ? That s rich...
Please explain. 🍿😋
So you are invoking international law and the laws of war when invoking the Nuremberg trials . Trying to claim the moral high-ground here ?  It would be nice if it wasn t for this...
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes#Iraq_War"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes#Iraq_War</a>"
Bush and Cheney should have been hung for Iraq.  Trump has stopped just short of saying as such.  He has tried to pull troops out much to the dismay of Congress.  It's almost as if the establishment politics of the US was a one party system charading as opposing through empty theatrics and media deception. 😱
"You don t get to pick and choose ...The US has been committing war crimes for decades ...but that s not even the issue . The real problem is that the US has never answered for it and never will . And yet each time claiming the moral high-ground ""we are the real victims so we get to do whatever the fuck we want and it will be just ... 200.000 dead civilians in Iraq ? Well that s war ...My Lay ? well that s war ...operation Ajax ? Well can t take chances with communism ..."" Always a nice excuse for a bunch of dead civilians but god forbid anyone lays a finger on a citizen ."
By the way did you know what happened 6 months before 9/11 ? Have you ever wondered why you never heard of Al-Qaeda before that ? Because they didnt really give a shit about the US and were only concerned with spreading their influence in the region ...until Dick Cheney showed up with a delegation and told them that a pipeline was getting built and they needed to get the fuck out or get carpet bombed ...diplomacy fuck yeah .
You really believe that Trump was going to bring the troops home all the while sending more to the he ME?
"You may wish to consider reigning in your tone here. This person was insulting public figures, people who take bold stances and make flashy decisions and garner news coverage. Being insulted by their detractors is part of their job."
"<em>You</em>, on the other hand, are being needlessly insulting towards another person on this sub. It's neither kind nor necessary. Your points may be better received if you behave in a more appropriate fashion."
And i m sure he s old enough to survive having his dumbness being called out .
"Calling out someone for being dumb, while making a litany of typos is always appreciated. If it were one or two, I'd let it slide, but you have nearly half a dozen. "
Get your house in order before criticizing.
Oh really then you won t mind pointing out where are those dozen typo right ? Oh let me guess ...that s a new way of bailing out while trying to save face ...got it.
"I said a half dozen, you tepid bag of piss. Nice that your reading comprehension measures up to your grammatical skills!"
So it would have been easier to list them ... plead the 5th son ...you re only hurting yourself

hmmm can you maybe not use slurs?
anyways his job description was agent of chaos
Here we go
<strong>[starting a war with Iran intensifies]</strong>
And yet he will probably still get re-elected. Sadly
"The really sad part is that if you look at the amount of votes presidential candidates get, the number barely varies. Republicans turn out regardless and they win when democrats stay home. So I always laugh when republicans talk about how they do not actually support Trump, statistically they can say that all they want but then they still go out and vote for their party candidate like the good little drones they are."
Every single moderate I know who voted trump 2016 will vote for him again in 2020. Most have also bitched about his since day 1.
They like Trump but also want the freedom to look down on other people when Trump does what he does.
"Trump offers easy solutions and makes you feel good by telling you how great you are. A smart person realizes that this is a con, a dumb or desperate person wants to believe the lie."

Christian Zionist believe that the second coming of Christ will happen in their lifetime and persue the fulfillment of the profetic prophecies.
1) Isreal is returned to the Israelis
2) Jarusalum is made the Capital of Isreal
3) The Temple Mount will be rebuilt
Then a great War Between Heaven and Hell will begin (Christians Vs Muslims)(Iran).  When the Heaven's Angels defeats Hells Deamons a great light will fill the world (Nuclear Holocaust) and Jesus will return to Judge the living and the dead in an instant.
"Its amazing how this is such a well documented conspiracy theory yet you will never see this on <a href=""/r/conspiracy"">/r/conspiracy</a> where they would rather do pizzagate thread #546 hey how about hillarys emails"
"Because conspiracy theorists are losers who need to feel smarter than everyone else. Which also describes racists, sexists and others who derive their worth from worthless things. And now tell me which party keeps pandering to the people I have described and suddenly it is very clear why these losers believe every anti liberal conspiracy."
That sub is for far right extremists. It's basically a front for the GOP
It used to be less partisan but Trump courted the conspiracy crowd and the Mods purged any left/center leaning posters.
Sometimes the truth is so horrible no one talks about it.  Japanese people don't talk about their historical involvement in WWII for example.  In the US we don't talk about our nearl completely successful mission to Eradicate the Native Americans.  Alot of American Christians are brainwashed into believing that Muslims are completely brainwashed.
Its best to imagine terrible things didn't or aren't happening.
"I highly doubt they believe any of that. It's really as simple as AIPAC and influential Zionists having A LOT of pull in the white house. Trump has had the least military action in the Middle East since maybe Carter or Reagan. He even put an end a $1 billion secret CIA war in Syria (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html</a>)."
"From what we have seen, he's only targeted legitimate strategic targets and people, and has deployed for less troops than any other president. Sure, we are still bombing people, but it's a huge step forward. We're arguing today over whether or not it was right to kill the leader of the largest state-sponsor of terrorism, and no longer arguing about invasions and occupations of entire nations."

"Esper and Pompeo graduated the US Military Academy together. Milley also supported the strike, which was authorized long ago by Trump."
How many military leaders did Trump have to fire before he found a few that would do as they were told?
Not nearly as many as we'd care to think about.
Its easier to fool someone than convince them that they have been fooled.
"Who cares about gossip trash, put this on <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a>"
I thought you guys were anti war?
what does anti war have to do with this article?  
"Call facts out what they are, and it is stupid post.  No need for a pentagon person ""stunned"" bullshit articles.  This is just pile on garbage to entice a circle jerk like on <a href=""/r/politics"">r/politics</a>.  It's stupid."
"A libertarian article would be the unnecessary expenditure for going to war.  The unnecessary lives to be lost, the poking our noses in bullshit.  This is gossip, and not what libertarian is about"
So you’re not anti war?
"We're all anti-war. This is a gossip propaganda article. Let's hold <a href=""/r/libertarian"">/r/libertarian</a> to a higher standard."
The dude calls war a waste of lives and resources.
"most of the time, yes.  You are missing the point"
"I’m not, the point is war"
"I think I get where the other guy is coming from. We all agree war is bad, what he/she is asking for is substantive discussion. Finding out the Pentagon is shocked is meaningless because he's the POTUS and therefore Commander and chief. Finding out his generals disagreed with him changes nothing about what's happening."
"True, it doesn't change the fact that trump authorized the strike, but it does show that, to some degree, that there is no solidarity at the executive. I never expect leaders to agree to everything behind closed doors and fully expect them to argue and brainstorm over an issue, but I also expect them to have a unifying voice in the public. The fact that the Pentagon is coming out and laying it all on Trump and publicly disagreeing with the assault is news, like it or not."
THIS is fair insight compared to the title
"The point is the article.  All of the sub is about war today, this post is trash.  There are many good posts, but this one is trash"
Well said.
"bill_ding_jr is saying put up substance. And if by ""you guys"" that that your coming into another sub to post something you think will be well received misses the point too."
An article needs teeth. There's a lot of information flying around not all of it's worth the time.
You will find alot of confused Anarchists here.

That's not what he's saying.

"Ahh he arbiter of what is and isn't acceptable. Reasons for a Gov assassination isn't a viable discussion, duly noted king Bill."
thats got a nice ring to it
Don't get butt hurt bc he isn't interested in your propaganda. He already shares your position but needs something with usable information.
Uhhh....read it.
"I did and I agree. It was gossip and frankly I don't care. It happened, what matters now is what happens going forward. Who knows who was quoted, could've been anyone. I truly doubt it was someone with power."
"And the military is rightly concerned with the lives of their troops. Of course they'll be more cautious and calculating, they're the ones doing the work and in dangerkl. The politicians not so much. Pompeo is a former CIA director. Did it surprise you that he supported an attack? It's what the CIA does. Frankly they're good at killing people."
"What of any of this is news or even usable? There's hundreds of people involved in things like this not everyone is going to agree, which is why there's a chain of command. Shit the pilot might have not wanted to fire but did bc he followed orders. Doesn't matter it's done."
"I for one supported the strike and am glad that monster is dead. But I'm worried it'll lead to war if cooler heads don't prevail. A war with Iran, even tho it would be swift, has the potential to destabilize the entire region permanently. That's bad."
On the other hand if Iran can use this as an opportunity to move forward bc one of it's most powerful people and a total war hawk is dead this could be a very good thing. It's going to be up to Iran to help move middle East peace forward. Not another American engagement.
"I for one supported the strike and am glad that monster is dead. But I'm worried it'll lead to war if cooler heads don't prevail. A war with Iran, even tho it would be swift, has the potential to destabilize the entire region permanently. That's bad."
"You and ISIS or ISIL are very happy he is dead, he was their worst enemy. Want to go into how he needed assassination? I am sure Trump will beak out the immediate threat BS anytime soon."
"Ugh he was a bad dude, killed a lot of Innocents. Including hundreds of Iranian protestors recently. He was in charge on the security forces that do those things. Just fucking Google it and if you can honestly support general Soleimani breathing the same air as everyone else than I guess we're just going to disagree. Shit the msm supported the strike for the most part. That's a pretty big deal bc they thrash Trump every chance they get. The wapo and nytimes did too. "
"Soleimani was a terrible human being. If you want to know how bad do some research and maybe you'll understand why do many people, including lots of Iranians, are glad he's dead."
Grow up shit isn't all sunshine and rainbows.
So in instances like this:
Afghan officials that a missile from a United States aircraft had killed 40 civilians and wounded 28 others at a wedding party in the southern province of Kandahar.
"Where people were gathered and celebrating, the Afghan army is entitled to assassinate Gen. David D. McKiernan? I mean it was just a mistake, but hey grow up we should do things this way we killed a bunch of people right? I mean as far as terrible humans go blowing up a wedding party is pretty high on the list."
What does that have to do with Soleimani? Who said America is perfect in it's precision or policy? Not me. But you can't throw out the baby with the  bath water. The dude was a horrible person and a big part of why Iran just cannot bring itself to the table and give up it's war mongering ways. Every fucking 3rd tweet or publication from them is to kill America or kill Israel or blah blah blah. How about let's be friends instead. 
And words are one thing but they acted in it regularly.
Can you imagine the amount of times a more moderate voice was silenced bc of Soleimani? In meetings at protests while making policy?
Sorry the dude was a bad person with the power and will to kill indiscriminately.
Were the raids on bin laden or al-Badri bad too? No. These guys play on a bigger stage than you and me and sometimes the consequence is death.
"True, let's keep it to Iran:"
"Iran Air Flight 655 was a scheduled passenger flight from Tehran to Dubai via Bandar Abbas, that was shot down on 3 July 1988 by an SM-2MR surface-to-air missile fired from USS Vincennes."
"That is pretty brutal, a commercial airliner, almost 300 dead with no survivors. We really shouldn't feel bad if Iran killed Capt. Will Rogers III, right?"
Democratic capitalistic system is deeply broke - everything will go to shit pretty soon.

"Yes, indeed! Thank you so much for continuing the failed neocon policy of alternately antagonizing and attacking mideastern countries. You’re a fucking baboon."
"Obama was a neocon? I thought I was in <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a>. This post is meant for <a href=""/r/Democrat"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Democrat</a>."
"The criminal Obama foolishly pursued several neocon policies, but there is no doubt among informed people they are neocon policies."
What does neocon mean?
"Is this a test or do you genuinely not know what it means? I mean, you’re on a computer and Wikipedia is only a couple of clicks away."
I know what it used to mean but the term has taken on so many meanings I doesn't mean anything. So I don't know what you mean.
"“Neoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and interventionism in international affairs, including peace through strength (by means of military force), and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism."
"Many of its adherents became politically famous during the Republican presidential administrations of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s as neoconservatives peaked in influence during the administration of George W. Bush, when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration included Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, and Paul Bremer. While not identifying as neoconservatives, senior officials Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel and the promotion of American influence in the Middle East.”"
So not Obama.
"Obama, Democrat president elected  from what once was the anti-war party,  furthered neocon designs by (absurdly) bombing EIGHT different sovereign nations without declaration of war after accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. It sounds like it’s lifted from an article by The Onion."
"If you don’t think Neocons dominate current American foreign policy, then you are either blinded by partisanship or just not paying attention."
"Informed people dont call it neocon policies. They aren't even really policies. Their reaction to events can form a policy, but informed people know that bush was lied to by intelligence communities and that's what drug us into Iraq. It was a military action against a threat that was manufactured. Neoconservatism is coined by the socialists on the left to somehow slur conservatism, especially American conservatism which was founded on mostly Libertarian values."
"I've never met a person who uses the term ""neocon"" that didnt share socialist values or could argue from an isolationist perspective, especially entry Iraq."
Your comment displays much confusion about some basic terms which explains why your worldview is muddled.
Non-interventionism is not isolationism. 
"The term “neoconservative” might have been coined by a socialist but was embraced by early neocons in the late 70s, especially by Bill Kristol’s father, and they weren’t conservatives, they were warhawk liberals."
"Libertarianism originated on the left. Early libertarians in France used the term when it was
made illegal to identify as an anarchist. Economically, libertarianism is related to conservatism, but that’s where it ends. If you’re another wayward republicans who wants to pretend that libertarianism is only economic, blow your horn elsewhere. Conservatism wants to tell me all the things I cannot do. Fuck that."
"Bush and Cheney (can’t leave that evil troll out) were given reports they wanted to hear that justified the actions they wanted to take. They are, and ever shall be, responsible for their part in the Mideast clusterfuck."
"Neocon policies are those based on neocon ideals of interventionism, force loading right wing democracies, and nation building, all of which benefit the military industrial complex."
I’m the furthest thing from a socialist.
"1: it is. If you are a globalist, you are an interventionalist by definition. We tried isolationism and ended up in 2 full scale wars within 50 years."
2: neocons arent warhawks because there's actually nothing conservative about interventionalism in the US. That is why people who call americans neocons are uninformed.
"3: It doesnt matter where Libertarianism started. It matters what Libertarianism is. This is an argument used by people who read the words but don't know what it means. Republicans may be leaning in the conservative category, but Constitutional Originalists are what define Conservatism in the US, Not the republican party. Maybe you shpuld look into what conservatives are saying before drawing conclusions instead of letting leftists tell you what conservative opinions are. This is the main problem with the faux libertarians in this sub; they aren't independent, they are partisan hacks. Cant even engage with the chriatian conservative argument against abortion."
4: for those of us who were entering adulthood at that time were told by the media that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and all of the intelligence agencies said there were weapons of mass destruction. You kids may not like the fact that the same people that insisted Trump colluded with the Russians also were the force that pushed us into iraq and destabilized the region.
5: What you said was the most nonsensical explanation of what neocons were. At least I think you were trying to explain what neocons were. Its like one of those definitions that just use the same word: taxation: the state of being taxed. This also reflect you really dont know much about neocons and use it more as a slur than in an actual conversation
"6: I really dont care about your political standing, you speak like a far leftist. You really dont have any objectivity."
"It's best to wait till tubes cool before removing them. You'll want to check all contact points and tighten the socket pins, if necessary. Make sure surfaces are clean too."

"In the next off-topic, republican-sucking post, we will be discussing the correct amount of gain stages for different audio applications."
"How do you tighten socket pins?  When I’ve had loose ones I’ve always been told to replace them, no one ever mentioned the possibility of just tightening them."

Imagine thinking Trump was a Libertarian even for a moment.
HE reDuCED taXEs
Unless you're paying SALT.
Trump fucked over 4.3M California Republicans. And it cost him 7 House Seats.
"Yeah, but those aren't real Americans. Everyone living in a blue state is the enemy of Trump, and therefore not deserving of his empathy or protection as president. Trump wasn't elected to lead America, he was elected to lead those who fellate him."
This is good for democrazy
"Although, why should I pay more in Federal taxes than someone in California with the same income simply because my state and local government tax me less? Shouldn’t we still pay the same Federal tax?"
"I would argue that SALT is somewhat libertarian as in it reduces your overall tax burden. Furthermore, the taxes you do pay go to more localized institutions below the federal government, which I would argue if you’re going to pay taxes, is preferable."
"I agree it is preferable for taxes to go to more localized institutions. But SALT doesn’t reduce your overall tax burden. If I pay 15k in local taxes, it reduces my taxable income by 15k, not my tax liability. So still paying more taxes."
They don't tax you less. They charge you property and sales tax instead of income tax
Which I can then itemize on SALT deduction on feds. And there are low tax and high tax states which charge individuals more or less.
"They capped the SALT deduction at $10k, so good luck with your filing."
I live in a low tax state. Even when I owned a house it didn’t reach 10k.
I live in Texas. When my house eclipses $500k (easy enough in the red hot real estate market in Austin) I'm on the hook for $10k and growing.
"Oh Austin. I haven't lived there in quite some time. Housing prices are through the roof there. Decades of bad road management and a ""if we don't build roads, Austin won't get too big"" mentality. I live in Houston and traffic in Austin is unbearable to me. I found this interesting, housing is soooooo much more in Austin (<a href=""https://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/austin-tx/houston-tx/52000"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>)"
It’s not the low taxes that keep you from paying it is the low pay and low housing prices.
What is the percent difference between a low tax and a high tax state? The total tax difference from top to bottom is another 5%.
"<a href=""https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/</a>"
Orangemanbad... got it.
Because the economy of scale difference and CoL means the person in California is living a worse life than you while making more money.  Now I know you think that if we just built homes our CoL would go down but what you either refuse to acknowledge or don’t know is that so would the pay.
"This is why we subtracted states income taxes because states with small economies, the south, have small pay scales and thus low cost of living, but states with large economies have larger pay scales and thus high cost of living. The state of California still needs to charge taxes from its residents that allow it to pay its public servants."
So it's based on economies of the individual states? Texas kind of throws that theory off though.
"Not really, Texans that live near major cities earn more and also pay more for CoL. If you own a home in Austin and work to afford it you wail easy go over SALT without living any better than someone that lives in Dallas.  Where money pools prices go up."
He reduced my corporate tax rate so I give him credit on the few good things he did that actually had an impact on my current life .  Downfall is I didn’t need it and I know the next blue president is going to have to raise taxes a lot to cover the deficit . Also none of my tax savings trickled down to my employees
"No, no, paying for your spending isn't fiscal conservatism. The Republicans are the true fiscal conservatives. Sign off on record levels of deficit spending, then cut taxes. Don't pay for anything. The bill will never come due. "
Just sell our children into slavery. What's wrong with that!
Don't forget to be triggered when Dems raise taxes back to cover the enormous deficit.
"This math is so crazy, who knew lowering taxes and raising budgets would end up causing debt?"
Just sell our children into slavery.
Your ass was sold off generations ago
Downfall is I didn’t need it 
You're always free to give it to charity in any manner you see fit.
Also none of my tax savings trickled down to my employees 
Is that Trump's fault or yours? Just saying.
Downfall is I didn’t need it and I know the next blue president is going to have to raise taxes a lot to cover the deficit
as if they will even do that. Nobody cares about the deficit anymore. Its the spending money Reps vs the Spending money Dems
Also none of my tax savings trickled down to my employees
Isnt that the best part /s
Because of Donald Trump‘s tax plan you can no longer deduct certain state and local taxes. Under Donald Trump my taxes have gone up.
"The tariffs were enough by themselves to put him far, far out of the Libertarian zone."
Imagine if all the people who want him to be a Libertarian voted for a real Libertarian.
Maybe not a libertarian per say but he has done some things libertarians should cheer.
"Tax cuts.
Cutting regulations on businesses.
Less ppl on welfare and work requirements 
Prison reform "
Just to name a few
"Obama cut taxes a couple of times, guess he’s a libertarian too now lol"
"He might not be, but cutting taxes is a libertarian thing to do."
Only when you cut spending along with it.
That’s also a libertarian thing to do.
So you consider them as two distinct libertarian ideas? So you think cutting taxes but letting the deficit sky rocket because spending hasn't been addressed yet is a libertarian ideal?
Name one candidate in 2020 who stands a chance of winning who is talking about the deficit.
I agree with your premise but there is the practical side of winning the election to contend with.
"If every dipshit like you who refused to vote for someone ""who doesn't stand a chance of winning"" actually voted for those people, we'd actually start winning things."
"Well, start having people who are less into “libertarian theory” and more into “practical libertarianism” run for office and maybe we can get somebody elected."
Or we can sit around discussing whether or not to legalize heroin and keep losing them.
Isn't that what cutting the deficit is? And Obama did that too.
"Sure, if the deficit was actually being cut. Instead Trump has <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/trump-deficit-debt-cbo-data-obama-1463802"" rel=""nofollow"">raised the deficit by 68% since he's started</a>."
"Umm you misunderstood me. Your post implied that Obama did not cut the deficit and had nothing to do with Trump... So I'm not sure why you're bringing up Trumps numbers, ofc they're terrible."
He raised both the debt AND the deficit. During an economic boom.
Compared to Obama who cut the deficit and increased the debt during a global economic collapse. 
"It's pretty clear which party is actually fiscally conservative: libertarians, Democrats, actual trash, Republicans"
"""Yeah, he's not remotely libertarian, but that won't stop us from bending over backwards to justify our votes for him!"""
"Also, who would you suggest voting for?"
"How about someone who isn't currently arguing that the president is above the law, or maybe someone whose party doesn't enable that type of power grabbing."
Which person would you suggest out of those running?
"Compare and contrast to Obama, George W, then get back to me."
Obama was pro TPP and Trump was not. Trump is also far more hard line on immigration. Trump is arguably less libertarian than Obama lmao
How many American citizens has Trump drone strikes compared to Obama?
"If Trump did, we’d never know about it now considering he revoked the rule requiring disclosure of civilian casualties in drone strikes lol. Real “libertarian” of him to shut down that bit of transparency."
Also how many US citizens has Trump deported?
We can do this all day.
"Neither was libertarian, each did some things libertarians should cheer."
Maybe not a libertarian per say but he has done some things libertarians should cheer
Neither was libertarian
Well that was a shift. Glad we agree now though. The amount of authoritarian bullshit from each of them far outweighs any of their so called “libertarian” actions.
"I never said Trump was a libertarian, I said he has done some things libertarians should cheer."
Also can you name on president in the past 50 years who could be considered “libertarian “?
He just passed a new drug law so yeah Fuck him

Probably the most controversial thing said on this sub
"It's to piss off libertarians, and you fell for the trap"
A few reasons that prove Don the Con is no where near a Libertarian:
He advocates eminent domain.
He is pro corporate welfare.
He is pro christianity.
He is willing to use our military for aggression not self defense.
Also using executive orders to ban bump stocks and flavored vaping....
Flavored vaping ban is the FDA.
"<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-e-cigarettes/"">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-e-cigarettes/</a>"
"So, with the President’s support, the Food and Drug Administration intends to finalize a guidance document that would commence enforcement to require that all flavors, other than tobacco flavor, would be removed from the market."
"Not an exec order, but a byproduct of the Trump admin is probably true based off of this."
Semantics. Head of FDA reports to the Secretary of HHS...a Trump cabinet member.
"Sure, and I acknowledged his direct involvement in a different comment."
<del>He is pro Christianity</del>
He is pro locking in the vote of people that think they are Christian
Read recently that he promised the christians that he would work towards the reinstitution of teacher lead prayer in public schools.
"I think the real issue for Christians is abortion, euthanasia and drug policy, and that will dictate who they vote for this year."
He knows how to pander to enough Christian voters to get a good chunk of the evangelical vote that Republicans live off of and ease their disgust at his character at least enough that they don't feel too grossed out by him to not vote for him.
"He and his family run the government like an organized crime syndicate: emoluments, pay-to-play, cover up attacks on our democracy, and the Statist in Chief institutionalized the kidnap of thousands of children, getting some raped and killed, adopting away others from their biological parents/family. "
"He uses deregulation and increased regulation as rewards for loyalty or punishment for disloyalty, like a natural tyrant. Ditto for tax cuts and tax hikes. He hiked taxes in the form of tariffs, but rather than stop running foreign policy based on his ego needs, he spends tens of billions extra in ag welfare to support his base."
He is pro christianity.  
Not really.   Guy who bangs porn stars behind his wife's back is not pro Christianity.   He is pro convincing Christians to vote for him by pretending to be Christian.
"This is a semantics argument, but I'd say there's a difference between being pro Christianity and being Christian or having Christian values."

ok that doesn't have proof
[deleted]
oh wow russian bot haven't heard that before I guess the 7 people that agree with me are Russian bots too what an excellent to dehumanize your opposition. 
Here's a tip just posting big amounts of articles that say the same thing isn't a good argument. Also people are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The accusations of someone who claims she was raped years ago and then mysteriously drops the case causes doubt
He did it though
now that's definitely a lot of proof
Since when do trump aupportera care about the truth.
still not proof
Still did it
and you haven't proved it
"Libertarians don't care who you pray to. Otherwise, you are spot in."
He is trying to give christianity favored status.
Seems he failed. Lol
What does being pro Christianity have to do with it? Many of the greatest libertarian minds of our time are Christians.
"Our government is supposed to be secular. All religions are supposed to be on an equal footing, no playing favorites. The preachers that Trump has been seen with are Dominionists, they are actively trying to establish a theocracy in the USA."
The fuck? Who in their right mind thinks trumps a libertarian?
Lots of idiots who post here
My ex does.
Unfortunately we will never get a president even remotely close to a Libertarian.  The right is all about growing the government with overall spending specifically with military and corporate handouts.  The left is all about growing the economy through entitlement programs.  
There's no winning.
I think having ranked voting would solve most of the problem after a few terms.
Part of the problem is that so many people confuse being a libertarian with anarchism.
"Because libertarians jerk off to ""tax is theft,"" which is anarchism."
I thinks more that many libertarians look at every law as an infringement to liberty rather then accepting “sensible laws”.
"Again, that's just anarchism. "
Don't want to be confused with anarchists? Don't be anarchists.
"“Government is, in essence, a negation of liberty.” -Mises"
"But they are. Every law is an infringement to liberty. Although, I have not seen any one on these pages state we need to get rid of every law. Perhaps I'm not looking enough. Some of these laws though, most people don't mind the infringement. Not very many people mind that it's illegal to kill someone. That's a pretty ""sensible law"" that I, at least, don't want to go away. I think the slippery slope in your statement is ""sensible"". Who determines that? "
"(As an aside, I fully understand that the actual law in the US is, ""don't kill anyone unless..."" and then there's a list of when it's fine (legally) to kill someone)"
"We only have ourselves to blame. We can't even decide to back a candidate that did have somewhat of a chance in 2016. Now it's way too late. People are so polarized because of Trump, at this point, voting 3rd party really is throwing your vote away this time around."
"It was always throwing away your vote, no third party candidate has ever won the presidency."
*Breathes in*
"""MAGAtarians"" are not Libertarians. "
"MAGAtarians are not libertarians, no matter how hard you screech."
stop gate keeping
No. Every ideology must engage in some form of gate keeping. Otherwise what stops a bunch of communists from saying they are republicans?
"No matter how much they say they are republicans, they aren't. Your views go against the core values on libertarianism on far too many issues."
"Let's see where you ""MAGA"" people are completely opposite us libertarians:"
"Libertarians believe that if someone is peaceful, they should be welcome to immigrate to the United States.<br/>
 A truly free market requires the free movement of people, not just products and ideas.<br/>
Libertarians do not support classifying undocumented immigrants as criminals."
"Now that doesn't sound very ""MAGA"". Neither does this:"
"We are committed to ending government’s practice of spying on everyone. We support the rights recognized by the Fourth Amendment to be secure in our persons, homes, property, and communications."
Nor does this:
"Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration."
How about this:
We oppose the administration of the death penalty by the state.
"Please man, where is the ""MAGA"" in all of this?"
"EDIT: I'm going to keep adding more ""MAGA"" viewpoints. I find it fun. We don't fully disagree with everything the Trumpsters do. But we are definitively <strong>NOT</strong> ""MAGAtarians""."
The Libertarian Party supports the decriminalization of prostitution.
And: 
"We oppose all forms of government subsidies and bailouts to business, labor, or any other special interest. "
And: 
The United States should both avoid entangling alliances and abandon its attempts to act as policeman for the world. 
And: 
The defense of the country requires that we have adequate intelligence to detect and to counter threats to domestic security. This requirement must not take priority over maintaining the civil liberties of our citizens.
And:
"We condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant. Government should neither deny nor abridge any individual’s human right based upon sex, wealth, ethnicity, creed, age, national origin, personal habits, political preference or sexual orientation."
"Oh yeah, and Trumps pick for Attorney General had this to say:"
Some people in this chamber love the Constitution more than the love the safety of this nation. We should all send President bush a letter thanking him for protecting us.
"Yes, we <strong>DO</strong> love the constitution more than your imaginary ""safety"""
"Agreed, completely.  Especially the part where a philosophy has to have some boarders and principles otherwise it becomes a meaningless term."
"Libertarian isn't republican, even though there is some overlap in principles.   It isn't democratic, even though there are also some overlap in principles.  And it definitely isn't dictatorship oriented authoritarian, which is where Trumpism exists.  There's very little Venn diagram overlap."
"Though I do think having one's philosophy challenged is good.  We live too much in political bubbles where people just double down on what they already believe with those who believe the same.  That's the way to extremism, which is bad in every philosophy."
"However, I am too Libertarian to actually want to do anything about this. "
"Spreading the message of liberty isnt against libertariansim, you made this post."
"Libertarians being Trump fans in such large numbers is why I kinda fuckin hate being libertarian, on top of the greasy racist neckbeard stereotype now people think we're full on trumpkins. I guess that's just what you get for really doing your homework in a world run by clickbait trash media."
This subreddit is a lot better at criticizing the President when it's a democrat. 
"It's been this way for a long time, the Koch bros have funded a half dozen think tanks to make ""libertarianism"" into an ideology that dovetails completely into right wing politics."
"Libertarians aren't Trump fans.  Some republicans like to claim to be libertarian, but they most certainly are not.  They don't vote libertarian and they only like libertarian ideas when they coincide with republican ones such as lower taxes and gun rights."
Because people are stupid
Does he even know what a libertarian is
<em>Meme magic</em> do be like that.
I guess I don’t recall him running as a libertarian or claiming to be one?
"Everyone knows this, or at least I hope they do"
"Uh, do people really think he's libertarian or is this some sort of shitty troll..."
"Trump was never libertarian, he doesn't even describe himself that way."
Bruh no shit
"I've seen so many inaccurate definitions of Libertarian lately that I've begun to feel it's a concerted effort. Maybe, just a theory now, with the left going further left and alienating their more moderate supporters that they fear they will vote Libertarian so need to smear the word to take that choice away from them."
THANK YOU.
"Somebody has to explicitly say this otherwise this is another <a href=""/r/pol"" rel=""nofollow"">r/pol</a> circlejerk sub"
Trump?!?!! not a libertarian?!  Arrest this man for the greater good!!!
Lol duh 🙄 what the fuck world you been living in to state the obvious 😂
no fucking shit. even libertarians know this
"Umm, duh?"
Are we going to have these posts once a week now?
these trump threads are so repetitive on this sub
not like I disagree
Cuckservatives are dumb what can I say?
No shit neither is Andrew Yang
I agree.
I feel like I see a thread with this title every couple weeks. Kind of a shame it needs to be restated so often.
"Politics is about practicality, if your candidate is closest in a certain characteristic you care about, in this case libertarian ideology, then you choose him as your representative. Trumps not perfect, but look at the opposing candidates (who have a shot of winning, so not third party candidates) who want an even larger government, and more government control of the stock market, economy, and everything else. Think practically."
The government is bigger now than it was under Obama. Does that make Obama more libertarian?
"If you’re talking about total federal budget you have an argument, but trump also cut the corporate tax rate, and tax rates for 80% of the US population. That’s certainly a libertarian implementation. He has also cut 2-3 regulations per new one implemented, isn’t that also libertarian, cutting down government red tape? Again, no candidate in the world is going to be perfect, but you gotta pick your favorite kitty from the small litter of kittens in front of you."
"If you’re talking about total federal budget you have an argument, but trump also cut the corporate tax rate, and tax rates for 80% of the US population. That’s certainly a libertarian implementation. "
"Great, so who is going to make up the now record deficit? Is it libertarian to cut revenue while increasing costs?"
"He has also cut 2-3 regulations per new one implemented, isn’t that also libertarian, cutting down government red tape? "
"What regulations is he cutting? EPA? Environmental? Allowing companies to pollute more violates the NAP, does it not?"
"Trump has also done notable non-libertarian things, such as:"
Increase the size of government
Interfere with free trade; increase the cost of trade (defacto tax increase)
Increased government subsidies to industries affected by his interference with free trade
Impede the free movement of people
Act as the aggressor in international conflict
Promote and court religious influence in government 
Target specific religions for additional scrutiny or impediment to entry
Pro drug war
Ban firearm accessories
"Tax cuts without spending reductions aren’t tax cuts at all.  They print money, accelerate inflation, which is a tax on everyone indirectly.  It’s Really just a tax increase on the poor."
Cutting taxes while raising spending is NOT libertarian.  It's idiotic.
There's a difference between acknowledging the very simple logic that Trump is closer to a Libertarian than Warren or Sanders and actually shitting on your own supposed beliefs so hard you end up liking the guy.
"<a href=""https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/donald-trump-the-most-libertarian-president-since-silent-cal/"" rel=""nofollow"">Donald Trump: The Most Libertarian President Since Silent Cal</a>"
"On the international stage, Trump has moved away from the liberal internationalism of the past, taking the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which many libertarians have argued didn’t actually promote free trade, and the Paris climate treaty, which would have cost the U.S. an estimated $3 trillion. United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also announced a $285 million reduction in the U.N. budget for the 2018-2019 fiscal year. The president additionally signaled in a tweet on January 1 that he plans to cut foreign aid to Pakistan and Palestine. And while Trump isn’t the pacifist that many of his libertarian supporters had hoped he’d be, especially when comes to the war in Afghanistan, his first year in office saw a radical decrease in American involvement in Syria, with an end to aid for CIA-backed rebels in the region."
"The Trump administration is also conducting the Defense Department’s first-ever audit, which will hopefully lead to fat-trimming from its massive $639 billion budget."
Lol ok .
"For the trolls here, he is."
His main values:
Of course this comes at a cost:
He's a fucking disaster.
Sure.  I meant main values to his voters.  And #3 might actually be #1.
Is Trump more libertarian than every other democratic candidate?....
"Maybe, but at what point do we draw the line? "
"For me it’s assassination of foreign leaders in a third party country, neither of which we are at war with. It’s fundamentally wrong, unethical and non-libertarian. The POTUS doesn’t even have such authority. He vaguely relied on the AUMF which is outdated and needs to be revised. The executive branch has had an egregious 65 years usurping the legislature’s vested power to declare war and we need to stand up and say enough is enough."
"The problem with your statement is we aren’t at war. Not saying it won’t happen, but sure as hell looks more like it won’t. Believing things before they happen is a major flaw of our country right now. "
Iran’s immediate capabilities are cyber attacks. They take out our electric grid and I’ll eat my words. But there is almost no chance they pick a direct fight with our military in which we’re losing thousands of lives.
"I said we weren’t at war with them, that’s the scary part. What do you call drone striking a high ranking general if it’s not war?"
Iran has done nothing to provoke this?
"What do you think they’ve done that was worthy of this? I won’t accept anecdotes or opinion either. “They control militias who have attacked thousands of us troops” is not a valid response. If this is the case, we would have done this in the 1970s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s. Why are they just now so big a threat that we are so bold as to assassinate their number 2? "
Trump is doing this to spite Obama. He’s mad that the master deal maker he imagines himself to be wasn’t the one who cut the Iran deal. They were even fulfilling their obligations under the agreement until YESTERDAY.
You are woefully ignorant of what Iran government wants to do to us. You are absolutely blind. YouTube “Iran parliament chants death to America”.... then tell me we should let them enrich uranium or they don’t want the worst for us. 
"Attack an embassy, shoot down our drone, try and seize our allies oil, we take out a military general accountable for hundreds if not thousands of our Troops deaths. "
Stop sticking up for a regime that wants to inflict more bad than good on this world. This is yet another reason you will get crushed at the ballot box
Ok
Yeah ok is the only answer you can give cause nothing of what I said was false. 
Meanwhile you’ll have left wing media bashing Trump for not sticking up for America when all this shit happens but as soon as he does it’s “war crimes and possibly more articles of impeachment because we’re going to war and he never asked Congress”.  But you can’t see the hypocrisy or even bring yourself to remotely understand a complex situation.
"Did Obama need authorization from Congress to launch 2,800 drone strikes? Noooooope. "
Did Obama or Hillary have a situation exactly like this in Benghazi where they DIDNT defend OUR fellow Americans? Yuuuuuup. 
"But here you are, trying to defend a RUTHLESS general who was a TERRORIST. Thankfully you aren’t making the decisions in this country. No one wants war, no ones going to war. If we were 50k Troops would have been there yesterday. Diversify your damn news and stop reading shit that only appeases to you"
No
He vaguely relied on the AUMF which is outdated and
From a legal standpoint here laws arent outdated. Theyre either legal or illegal. AUMF is pretty much in the legal column as the SC has refused to overturn it repeatedly.
"In some ways (mostly economic), yes, you're right. However, if I want to look at #libertarian I don't want to see some boomer shit about how Trump will lead us into the new age of Christianity or something"
Look what he's done to the national deficit. How is that close to being economically libertarian?
"I mean I get that, but that shit just kinda comes with Reddit"
"Dude’s talking about IG, not Reddit.  Must be whomever he follows, I don’t see anything like it in my feed."
"Ah, no. "
Pretty sure He’s made that incredibly obvious.
Anyone that uses boomer as an insult has already lost me.
ok boomer
"No trump is not a libertarian. You don't need an IQ north of 150 to figure that one out. Trump isn't even conservative (though he has been running a pretty conservative administration in many ways) most libertarians know this, as do most conservatives."
"However he is bringing out the derangement on the socialist left. And more and more people are aware of that derangement. He is slowing down the socialist influence in our politics. To most small government libertarians, socialism is public enemy number one, because most modern day free market libertarians, understand that if socialism prevails, than libertarianism goes out the window. So that must be defeated for any form of libertarianism to have a future. "
"That is why you see a lot of support amongst libertarians. But make no mistake, even the hardcore libertarian trump supporters, know full well trump is not libertarian. However they understand where the democratic party is today, and the influence the radical leftists progressive socialist base has over that party. Trump is standing in the way of that, so plenty libertarians are standing up for him. Not to mention the corruption they see going on within Washington, with the democratic party and Washington establishment against trump, just makes them double down on their support. As well as remind them why they voted for him."
"You don't have to believe me on this. Leftists can continue to live in those bubbles they have created for themselves. I actually encourage you do. However I only think it's fair, to give you a window into the actual reality of the situation. That way you are at least warned."
"TLDR: ""I like Trump because he owns the libs"""
"Truly, this is peak voting logic"
"An actual authoritarian in office is a good thing, because he....get this....is preventing authoritarianism. "
Or something. I'm not sure. The logic isn't all that sound. But it really makes sense if you don't think about it.
"It's not about ""owning the libs"" like this is some fucking political competition or something. People legitimately fear socialism. Regardless of what umbrella its under. They see a radicalized leftist socialist movement with massive influence over our politics. To a lot of people that must be stopped. Their futures depend on it. In their minds anyways. "
That's the logic. This isn't a football game to them. It's not about ego's anymore. It's a lot deeper.
They see a radicalized leftist socialist movement with massive influence over our politics.
"You have fallen for the propaganda, hook line and sinker, man.  Because no such thing exists in this country"
"Really? You don't see a socialist influence within the democratic party? I just commented to another poster, why the a few freshmen reps (the squad) who should be relatively unknown. Who hold no high ranking leadership positions. Or any leadership positions, and with relatively no experience in Washington, have any voice or recognition at all! Let alone the influence and voice they have? "
Because of the growing influence of that radicalized base. That's apparent. You don't need fox news to show you that.
But dont believe me. I don't expect you to. And call it propaganda. I expect nothing less from you. But I have an argument I believe.
"Or any leadership positions, and with relatively no experience in Washington, have any voice or recognition at all! Let alone the influence and voice they have? "
"Because they know how to use social media and are young, whereas the vast majority of elected people on both sides of the isle are old and don't know how to at all."
But I have an argument I believe.
"Of course you do.  After all, you were told to"
"Lol.. Dude not exactly. I hardly go by right wing media. I mean I understand that is propaganda as well. It literally all is. That's why you just take fact and perspectives from all sides, and draw your own conclusion. Its actually pretty simple."
"Also my post was just addressing the sentiment on the other sides, and not necessarily me. I take issue with socialism for my own reasons. I have a different take than most conservatives on that. "
As far as the radical influence. That's just apparent. Anyone willing to look can see.
You don't see a socialist influence within the democratic party?
"to be equally hyperbolic, do you see the fascist influence within the republican party?"
They see a radicalized leftist socialist movement with massive influence over our politics
Where?
The squad has been around for a year and they're still FOUR people in the House.
The entire Dem establishment is trying everything they can to stop Bernie.
"The Dems are the neoliberal party, not the socialist party, no matter what the neocons say."
"If you're going to call everyone left of center Socialists anyway, then they see no reason to play the centrist game."
"I understand is not a socialist party. I understand the democratic establishment is against Sanders. (They also figure Sanders doesn't win a general election against trump, so that does factor in to standing against Bernie). And yes, I'm aware the politicians in the democratic party aren't actual socialists or extreme leftists. "
"It's the influence the radicalized elements of the democratic parties base have on them, that is the problem for a lot. The fact that you do have these four reps (the squad) with any real influence, let alone the amount they have, is a testament to how much the influence the radical left has over the party. "
"I mean these are just young freshmen politicians, with no real experience in Washington, no high ranking positions of leadership, or anything really. They should be relatively unknown, and with minimal influence at best. However they seem front and center, being a thorn in Pelosi's side. "
"So why do they (the squad) have the voice that they do, and influence? (Because they influence Pelosi's moves) "
Because their base behind them has influence. 
Why is Bernie even being talked about to a lot of people?? Why is he a famous name in Washington?? 
"Because that is the progressive influence, and the progressive culture surrounding the Democratic party at the current moment. People can see that. It's not about what politicians label themselves in Washington. Because being a self admitted socialist isn't an easy sell to a lot of people, doesn't mean they dont pander to the radicals."
The entire Dem establishment is trying everything they can to stop Bernie.
"You also have Elizabeth Warren still standing (who claimed to have Native American blood), Beto who had quite a memorable run (who is the best gun salesman around) along with others with policy proposals like socialized medicine and raising the minimum wage. The Democrat Party is splitting because of how radical the left has gone. It makes moderates look like conservatives. Radically changing a good economy and violating our rights justify socialist fear."
"Beto's been out for a while, that gun thing didn't help him at all so I don't know where you're going with that one."
"Warren's Native American crap claim has absolutely zero relevance whatsoever on this subject and you know it. She's an Interventionist on the economy, not even State Capitalist. Really, everyone is in the West now."
"Min wage, gun control, et al."
Still not socialism.
"As for socialised medicine, everyone left of center is waiting for the ever elusive Republican alternative to ACA, which they have had a decade to conceive and still have <em>nothing</em> to show for it."
It's clear that the health insurance and pharmaceutical lobbies are ripping us off no matter what you believe.
"The pro-capitalist crowd needs to propose something to deal with the issue or shut the hell up, because the current state of healthcare in this country is a steaming pile of crap."
"Beto's been out for a while, that gun thing didn't help him at all so I don't know where you're going with that one."
who had quite a memorable run
"I didn’t write much, so that should have been obvious. The point was that he could run with his proposals and last as long as he did. "
"Warren's Native American crap claim has absolutely zero relevance whatsoever on this subject and you know it. She's an Interventionist on the economy, not even State Capitalist. Really, everyone is in the West now."
Identitarianism and race pandering is staple in the realm socialist and SJW politics. “Getting rid of the electoral college” and “Healthcare is a basic human right” are two of her policy proposals. Radical change + socialist policies = modern day leftism. 
"Propose something or shut the hell up, because the current state of healthcare in this country is a steaming pile of crap."
"The topic of this conversation was the fear small government libertarians and conservatives have in regard to the rise of socialism in the Democratic Party, making DJT look like a viable option. Bad is better than nothing? That’s your advice to us?"
However he is bringing out the derangement on the socialist left.
"Cool, so does Rush Limbaugh.  I don't need a troll in the white house just to own the libs"
"Finally, a post with some thought that actually opposes the popular narrative “Trump is Satan incarnate” in this subreddit. Most conservatives I know don’t even like him, but they sure weren’t going to vote for Hillary. "
There’s nothing wrong with not liking the guy. There’s nothing wrong with disagreeing with his actions. He’s the best candidate out there for the presidency that actually has a shot though. 
"The other popular candidates are too radically left even for left-leaning libertarians in this sub but a lot of people act like he’s the worst. Increased minimum wage, eliminating private healthcare for universal healthcare, forcefully taking people’s guns, and spending trillions of dollars in these plans are all proposals seriously made in these candidates’ campaigns. "
"Instead of having someone that’s just better than Trump these people are proposing radical changes during a time when the economy is already doing really well. Don’t just point the finger, do better! Vote LP if you hate Trump, or don’t vote at all."
"The left is insane. Idc if trump isnt ""full blown"" libertarian. The left will never get my vote until they stop being insane"
Seems like there’s insanity from both sides these days
Because libertarians are stupid and right-wingers are stupid.
no one hates libertarians more than libertarians
"Candidate Trump appeared to be libertarian. He could make a lot of promises then because unlike everyone else running he had no political history and his business success was assumed because he would not release any proof (tax returns). The lesson voters have hopefully learned now is 'Trust, but Verify' before casting a vote. "
My tin foil hat thought about his attack on Iran. To keep Mr. Bolton happy and Not testify against him in the Senate trial.
He’s not a libertarian but at least not a career politician.. he’s been a registered Democrat and a Republican. I don’t believe he takes a firm stance on many issues left or right or that we libertarians would care about. If he passes conservative type legislation it’s for political gain not his personal beliefs I think. 
No he’s not a libertarian but he’s also not your normal democrat or republican either so other than throwing away your vote on a libertarian in our current political environment he was the most outside the box candidate #mostlibertarianpresidentever lol
Fuck off with the stupid vape and smoking shit though Mr. President. Not cool. Not cool at all.
I agree with your assessment.
You can point to some things he has done and say “hey that is great by libertarian standards” and you can look at other things he has done and say “that looks horrible by libertarian standards”.
Is he more or less of a libertarian then Obama? George w? Bill Clinton? George bush?
You’d have to look at each factor of libertarianism and then rate it against each president 
Taxes. More than Obama and Clinton for sure. Probably equal to bushes. Not enough libertarian in this category either way
War. Up until last week better than all of them what happens now is yet to be determined. 
Personal freedoms/small government. Besides the vape and smoke thing he hasn’t done anything negative in this field. He’d beat Clinton / Obama on regulation. How you think he sizes up with the bushes? Don’t remember if they took any freedoms away. Again not libertarian enough.   
Plenty more areas to rate them but don’t feel like spending all day on this. 
My point was an actual libertarian winning the presidency is a pipe dream as of current. So I voted for the guy who had a chance of winning and wasn’t campaigning on taking my freedoms away. He was the most libertarian candidate with an actual chance of winning at the time 
But no.  Not an actual libertarian
"You make some really good points. I think it’s also refreshing to see someone who is not a career politician in politics, I think it’s harder to corrupt someone who is already financially secure."
Right. I agree that Washington would corrupt him as easily because he has no need for the lobbyists kickbacks to pass certain favorable legislation and whatnot. He’s already good financially. 
That doesn’t mean he wasn’t corrupt in other ways to begin with or couldn’t be corrupted by Washington but at least there’s some hope that it would be less likely since politics is not his lifelong career. These guys Presidents are corrupt before they even run for President and the presidency just makes them more corrupt. 
So you can either vote for the already corrupt guy/lady or vote for the person that might not be corrupt yet and keep your fingers crossed he makes it out without sliding into corruption.
"Also, if not Trump, who to vote for?"
Sanders? Good god please tell me that libertarians still oppose communists.
Biden? Warren?  Both proponents of bigger government?
"I think real libertarians would agree. But this sub might as well be <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> with how many “libertarians” are perfectly fine losing all their freedoms to not have trump."
Trump propaganda makes Trump look like whatever the group they are pandering to Look like.  If a group wants Trump to be XXX that is what they spin him to be. 
Forget what actual is. It is what ever his campaign wants people to think he is.
Trump is not an ostrich.
"It is important to say this, because frequently he is mistakenly labelled as such."
"The label 'not-ostrich' is a very useful term, since it tells you so much about the person."
"The purist ostrich virtue signals by applying the term 'not-ostrich' to those that fall short of the standards. The philosophical problem comes into play when one questions the ostrichness of ostriches by applying 'not-ostrich' to particular hated ostriches. This is a problem because there has yet to be a really good clear convention among ostriches as to what being an ostrich really is, and how far in the gray zone between ostrich and not-ostrich one can flap and peck."
"For a not-ostrich, even one who says he is not an ostrich, to be associated with ostriches is cultural appropriation of the highest form, an insult. To emulate in any way the values of ostrich is to become something far worse than a not-ostrich. The ostrich club is a tight knit group of right thinking synchronized ostriches who all share the same thoughts and ideas without deviation. At least they do in the purist ostrich ideology."
"If a bunch of ostriches are squawking about the higher values of ostrichism, and along comes a big fat rhino and sits on one, no ostrich can talk about that rhino because it is not ostrich, and squawking is restricted to only things ostrich, even if it is a big fat not-ostrich sitting on top of several ostriches. One must put one's ostrich head in the sand and pretend that rhino is not sitting on one's friends."
"Uh yea, no shit."

Because Jesus was a voluntaryist. Antithetical of socialism.

So did all those T_D posters in that thread.
Sounds like they have at least one thing in common with libertarians.
Yup- the trump trolls are very upset when the mods of this sub pin comments stating otherwise. 
Good thing your have that FEE.org article - otherwise it wouldn't be libertarian for the president to start a war with Iran to distract from his impeachment.
"I have no idea what tangent you are flying off on, nor do I care."
"Sure seems like you care - you are here trying to pretend that Jesus wasn't a socialist, despite him literally saying that it would be easier for a camel to pass through a needle than for a wealthy person to get into heaven, and that in order to follow him you must give away all you own to the poor."
Sounds like Jesus was a Hindu to me.
oops- it appears you posted in the wrong thread.  
"TD users are welcome to post here, but you'll get more luck posting in subs like /goldandblack, where true conservatives gather to discuss how infallible Donald Trump is."

"But feel free to post whatever got you ""banned"" from there!"
One only has to look at the volumes of stories from the character known as Jesus to see he espoused the ideology known today as libertarianism
The Golden Rule ( pretty much the motto of Libertarians ) 
Thrift ( The parable of the Lost Coin ) 
Entrepreneurship ( The parable of the Hidden Treasure ) 
The Productive Use of Capital ( The Parable of Talents ) 
Negotiation of Debts ( The Parable of the Unjust Steward ) 
Respect of Other's Property ( The Parable of The Faithful Servant ) 
Freedom of Association/Contract ( The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard )
Exactly. That’s why he charged market rates for his fish and loaves.
"I mean, of course we all remember the part in the Bible where Jesus said all sinners should go to the Gulag for re-education, and to hard labor camps to serve the starving collective, anytime they dared to have an individual thought that did not serve the party."
Are we arguing over what a fictional character from 2000 years ago would be politically if wandering around today? What a useless thing to do.
Is Jesus a libertarian?
"Naw, he’s a dictator."

No basically... basically everyone is saying he's a warmonger
"Only alternate reality, otherwise known as right wing news, claims he's antiwar"
"Only alternate reality, otherwise known as right wing news, claims he's antiwar "
TIL CNN is right wing news.
Didn't some dude from fox news move to a head position at CNN?
"No idea but this article was written by a senior international correspondent with CNN, previously a Kabul correspondent for CNN and Russian correspondent for The Guardian but none of that matters because the guy posting this absurd nonsense has the support of this sub apparently."
CNN is far right?
"Yeah, the troop pullout of Iraq is really warmongery."
"Getting kicked out is such a weird way to say ""pullout"""
We've pulled out our troops from Iraq? Big if true
"Trump has had the least military action in the Middle East since maybe Carter or Reagan. He even put an end a $1 billion secret CIA war in Syria (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html</a>)."
"From what we have seen, he's only targeted legitimate strategic targets and people, and has deployed for less troops than any other president. Sure, we are still bombing people, but it's a huge step forward. We're arguing today over whether or not it was right to kill the leader of the largest state-sponsor of terrorism, and no longer arguing about invasions and occupations of entire nations."
Hahahahahhabahahahahha
Hold on
Wait 
You're actually serious?
Hahahahahahahha
"You sound like a ""left-libertarian""."
"Ahh, ""media"" said, kinda like ""people"" say. Doesn't get much intellectually lazier than this."
This title is nonsensical.
OP is trying real hard to push an agenda
"We got kicked out of Iraq. If we stayed after their vote, it would essentially be an occupation. He did not pull us out of Iraq."
We have not been kicked out of Iraq... it’s complicated. Btw that vote was already scheduled. The legislation had already been written.
"It’s not really that complicated. They voted that we leave, we were supposedly going to leave less than 24 hours later. If we stay, we are there against the will of a sovereign country’s parliament"
"That’s not how it works. Sorry, it’s like saying because Trump was impeached he was removed."
LOL okay dude
Weird that that guy Media can have so many different opinions.
"They cant find their talking points, honestly, that’s the issue. They don’t have talking points because they want the power later they just don’t like who has it now. "
"Silent on Obama limited in options for Trump. Make no mistake the DNC is going all out on focus groups here, they have loaded the plate. Once they tell the press you’ll get a message"
Or maybe trump just turns everything he touches to shit.
"They cant find their talking points,"
That's a funny way of saying trump flip flops and flounders so much no one can keep up with the sheer amount of chaos and disinformation he produces
"Yes, the position they're in is funny. Can't make Trump look too bad for this or we maybe people will remember how Clinton and Obama killed Gaddafi, which brought ISIS and turned Libya into a ravaged dump with open-air slave markets. Can you IMAGINE if this happened to Iran under Trump? They would be all over him."
"""Trump has no idea what he's doing, and enjoys saber rattling and chaos to the extent that he may accidentally drop us into WW3 because he has no idea what to do when he runs into someone as strong as he is, or whose will is greater. He's a bully waiting on someone to get tired of his shit and punch him in the nose...and when that happens, innocents will die. The other superpowers are aware of his character and are planning to their best advantage."""
"There, we good now?"
Yeah the media is the problem.
Btw we just lost the war in iraq by giving it to iran
"""Orange man bad"" is the only consistency in the media narrative."
So our media is doing it's job.
"Putin is Trump's puppet master and he does whatever Putin wants.  Also, Trump wants to start a war with a Russia allied country."
Russia
allies
Pick one
if he does whatever Putin wants why would he start a war proxy war with Putin?
Schroeder's Trump.
OK....
"While I like the overall thrust here, I can't help but wonder how long it will be before Paul is appearing at Trump rallies to campaign with him. Think he'll bring this up then?"
Paul endorsed Trump in '16. Why wouldn't he in 2020?
"First it will be Trump got bad advice, then it will be ""military went rogue"", then it will be ""ONLY TRUMP CAN SAVE US FROM THE DEEP STATE""."
"Rand should suck someone else's dick for a change. Clearly, he needs to have a dick in his mouth to survive but maybe some variety would do him good."
Man - if only the president decided the people that advise them on foreign policy
"Lmao wow. Strong statement there, Rand."
The man is terrified of offending anyone to the right of the Democrats
He supports this.
But he's gotta keep the rubes convinced he's Libertarian
"All he needs to do is say ""i might have read a libertarian article once"" and the morons will defend him in droves."
"Huh, impressed he pulled Trump’s dick out of his mouth long enough to say this"
"It still defending Trump. Its not Trump bad, its ""Trumps advisers"" (military) are bad."
Apparently the buck doesnt stop with the president when its his decision. Betcha he never gave Obama that.
"Yep, better late than never."
"Lmao, fuck off Rand."

Republicans instantly got on board. Amazing.
on the bright side if Tucker talks Trump into leaving they will jump on board just as quickly.
Then when they get mocked for it they'll cry
You guys just hate us no matter what we do because you think orange man bad
Except theres no 9/11 to boil blood. Lets hope they don’t manufacture another one
Trump supporters are more deranged than the SJW left they always complain about if they can switch to being pro-war this easily just because this time it’s coming from Trump. 100% a personality cult.

"""Qanon already owned the libs and proved that the Statue of Liberty is a giant Mecha, so it's reasonable to say Iran has done the same."""
It does sound like something Iran would do. 
It is convincing to people that look at this at face value.
Why wouldn't you hide shit in a place that your enemies have to break international law to attack?  Seems like an obviously good idea.
because then you destroy your entire culture's 3000 year history? We wouldnt hide missiles in Independence Hall lol why would they hide missiles in ancient ruins? They're not idiots...
Hamas is hiding military hardware in hospitals and schools for exactly that reason.
B-b-but think of the <em>children!</em>
"Hamas is not Iran? Or even Shiite? It's a Palestinian organization affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, not Hezbollah."
...parallel strategy from another terrorist organization.
"If we bomb their cultural sites, we are no better than the fucking Taliban."
"Actually we're worse, the Taliban atleast only deals with their own affairs near where they live."
If the Taliban were to start bombing the statue of liberty however then we'd be about the same
"to be fair, they probably would if they could."
Are you fucking retarded?
And if there ARE military assets there?
Hamas has assets in schools and hospitals specifically for the optics.
"Then, we provide proof and bomb the fuck out of it.  At that point, it was their choice.  But, we shouldn’t target “cultural sites” just because they are cultural sites."

Congratulations on your enlistment today. 
"Oh, wait, you didn't volunteer to go and fight, and to pay for the increasingly inevitable military adventurism that flows forth from your comment? Well how about that..."
No am not currently eligible to enlist what would you recommend to do if another country attacks America
Is a protest attacking? They never entered the embassy and started a fire outside of it's walls. Americans do that here in large numbers. Is it acceptable to assassinate Americans because of those same actions?
They tried to break into the embassy
Well halle-fucking-lujah
Something good DID come out of this in the end
Remember when we withdrew like 100 troops from Northern Syria and sent like 1000 more to Iraq and T_D thought it was great that Trump was getting us out of the Middle East?
Just saying we ought to leave those chickens uncounted for the moment.
"Agreed, but signs are looking positive that it's going to happen"
Apparently Esper just said they’re not withdrawing.
I’m usually an optimist but i haven’t seen anything in 3 years that would convince me to look at the glass as half full.
Ugh what a bunch of fucking morons
Sounds like this document was actually a draft and was not meant to be presented to the public. They’ve just retracted the statement.
Yeesh
Relations with Iraq have now soured to the point where they voted to kick the US out of their territory. Not to mention the looming war with an even more formidable foe. This victory is pyrrhic.
"You see <a href=""/u/Cycloptichorn"" rel=""nofollow"">u/Cycloptichorn</a>  have a little faith. It's not all bad, right??"
I'm guessing your vote is going to be red down the ticket now😉 Lol
"Nah they were lying lol, they ain't pulling out shit"
¯_(ツ)_/¯
How many more times must trump lie about leaving the middle east before you realize he's lying every time?
"Ummm, yea. That's not on trump. There was an unsigned letter stating the removal of US troops in Iraq. Than an official response from the Pentagon correcting that letter. Sounds like the military industrial complex there. It really is its own branch of government. It's own separate government entirely almost. You didn't know that?  So I can't really put that on trump."
"No I never hold by breath for some sporadic large scale pull out, of the middle east. It wouldn't matter who was president. Why? Because I'm a realist. However he is trying. He pulled out of Syria (which enraged the military and establishment), and he, I think, what looks like with that letter,  wanted to comply with the request to remove troops from Iraq this time around. Unfortunately it looks, he doesn't have that power. Not for that drastic of a shift in foreign policy. No president would. I'm guessing you think your preferred president would? Well they wouldn't.  This kinda shit is eye opening. You should really take notice."
"And being a realist. I didn't vote for trump for the purpose of some major pull out of the middle east. I stand against socialism. The radicalized socialist base of the democratic party has dangerously increasing influence over that party and our politics. I believe it must be checked. It is being checked. That is a big enough issue, to compromise some of my personal stances for the bigger goal. "
"I am not an ideolog. I'm not libertarian. And I am not even really conservative. I am anti socialist. Because of that I am committed (for the time) to the conservative movement. Since conservatism and the republican party are the only things standing in the way of socialism and that influence, I stand with them. Eventhough I live my life far from a conservative. So anything else beyond the threat of socialism (depending on what it is of course) is on the back burner."
"Its funny though. It sounds like you would believe that if you had a candidate that you truly liked and trusted, that they would be able to do some large scale drastic shift in foreign policy, with the removal of troops, resources and influence, from all the middle east, if that candidate was making the claim?? If you actually believe that, you are going to be set up for disappointment time and time again. "
"Open your eyes to what is going on. I hope your not one of those socialist leftists, who want to give more power over to this government. Because if so, you should really be taking notice to a lot of what has been unfolding. Because we actually are getting a glance at the corrupt power structures that run this country. I think its extremely naive to think some uncorrupted, transparent, democratic socialist system would work the way they think. It most likely wouldn't, and rather blow up in their (our) faces."
"Ummm, yea. That's not on trump"
"Ah yes the classic American adage ""the buck stops somewhere else, please stop looking at leadership to be accountable for their actions and failures""."
Rolls right off the tongue
"hope your not one of those socialist leftists, who want to give more power over to this government"

Actual title: Pentagon chief denies U.S. leaving Iraq; Tehran crowds mourn commander
"After the assassination of the Iranian general, Trump's supporters should admit they were wrong that he was anti-war."
"This article makes the erroneous assumption that his supporters actually had an anti-war stance to begin with, rather than a pro-Trump stance.  This is hardly the first time that Trump has clearly reversed course on something.  In those instances, have his supporters, other than a small number of exceptions, admitted they were wrong?  Of course not.  Definitionally, therefore, the Trump side is the ""right"" side, and any historical inconsistency in his words and actions can be explained with the most convenient of the following explanations:"
"It’s a personality cult. They don’t have principled stances of their own and can’t comprehend that Trump and the Pentagon would lie and misrepresent the actual events despite Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other American wars being lied about."
Why No witnesses
"Witnesses are bad for their case, so they just won’t call any."
Shoot I want sleepy Joe on the stand
"I want the president on the stand, but I see why they don’t want him anywhere near needing to be under oath."
That would be sooo great
I doubt it was Trump that organized mass demonstrations in Iran. And those who did obviously didn't give a damn about crowd safety.

Lincoln is the fucking man. Polk is totes underrated
Polk annexed Texas and Oregon by arguing that both were actually part of America at one point and they needed to be re-annexed. Not very Libertarian in terms of land use. 
He was Jackson's protege actually.
"Well if we are evaluating by how libertarian, the Fourteenth ammendment represents the greatest increase in the power of the federal government in our contries history also taking lincoln off the table."
"While i dont agree with everything polk did, what i admire about him is that re ran on a platform of five specific issues and promised to only deal with those issues and only take one term as president. He was honest about his objectives and accomplished them straight-forwardly. Thats unheard of in american politics"
"As an American, Lincoln is awesome."
"As a libertarian, is he? I suppose during wartime (especially civil war) its very difficult to follow libertarian principles."
I agree. Lincoln is probably the best president and least libertarian president
Kennedy simply for the fact that we got to the moon in 8-9 years
"Clinton was president for 2,920 days, so if he spent roughly 1,000 days bombing Iraqis, and <em>still spent less than Bush, Obama,  and trump in any one year</em> he's the greatest military genius the world has ever seen. I wish someone did more reporting on that. Come to think about it, we have lost a lot of wars since he left, so you might be right about that."
I have know idea what your comment on kids relates to.
Andrew Jackson solely bc he’s the only one who could ever beat the Central Bank. Not a fan of the whole Seminole Wars tho
This d00d
"Theodore Roosevelt or Lincoln, depends on my mood really. One saved the nation, the other saved the nations land. I suspect Roosevelt would have happily fought a civil war too actually. "
"Purely from a ""love that quote"" moment, Jackson. Nothing beats his comments on what he should have done to his VP Calhoun."
Isnt roosevelt the father of american socialism?
More like American exceptionalism. He liked wagging the American military capabilities. 
Edit: Theodore people..
So Theodore not Franklin. Mr teddy. Meh.
"If you're talking about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he put Americans into internment camps with no due process, and extended and worsened the great depression."

Then maybe you should have said more than the last name.

"As for favourite president, probably Kennedy."
Carter and eisenhower
"Clinton. The economy was left to it's own devices, and all we had to worry about was excessive blowjobs. First world problems."
"Unless you were LGBT, in which case policy was less then thrilling. Also, higher taxes, deregulated oversight of the company Enron (woopsie), passed a law prohibiting protesting, passed multiple gun restriction laws, and DMCA."
"but ya, econonically he was slightly libertarian."
higher taxes
Ehhhhhh...
"Only if you compare it to Reagan's last couple years and Bush's term, and a bunch of the increase was Bush anyway.  Clinton added two new marginal rates, but it wasn't an increase on people making about 80k or less per year.  Top marginal rate under Clinton was 39.6%; that's lower than it was from 1932 to 1986.  It was at 50% for the majority of Reagan's presidency.  Likewise, the top corporate tax rate had been cut to 34% in 1988, and Clinton only raised it to 35%; it had been at least 38%, and often as much as 50%, from 1942 through 1988.  He did increase taxes on social security income.  But he also reduced taxes on capital gains, and made the estate tax exemption larger."
"All things considered he didn't raise taxes by an enormous amount, and generally speaking lower income people saw their taxes go down.  And we ran a surplus."
"I doubt you will find any president with a record people 100% agree with. I would also like to remind you that <em>congress</em> creates laws, not the president. I have no idea what Clinton did that was anti-LGBT, or that raised taxes from the Bush era, or that offended you so much on guns. Either way, paying for goods and services is very libertarian, as opposed to borrowing and stuffing your kids with the bill. I would gladly go back to Clinton laws in exchange for 1 trillion a year in deficits. You wouldn't? Sweet. I have so much to sell you."
"I have no idea what Clinton did that was anti-LGBT,"
"DOMA, DADT. "
or that offended you so much on guns.
He passed the Federal Assault Weapon ban.
I would also like to remind you that congress creates law
"If they'd overwritten a veto, id forgive him. He passed the bills into law. He doesn't get a break."
"$1 trillion per year, to be paid by your kids and grandkids forever, for those three?  Best trade deal in the history of trade deals ever."
Its fascinating that you give the president credit for something out of his hand (per your last post) but none of the negatives he did cause.
"Why does Clinton have no hand in bills. But the economy, which he doesn't actually control and spending, which congress does, is his work?"
"Because presidents cant control the economy, but they sure can fuck it up. An actual Libertarian would not be a law maker, but accused of being a ""do nothing"".  Resisting the temptation to take action is the problem."
Except for that whole bombing Iraq every three days and depriving half a million children to death thing. :/
I liked Lyndon Johnson as a senator for his means of persuasion
"Only slightly related but I had a number of friends from Iraq and they would talk about Saddam’s military would go through an area Saddam was going to be in and force them to go and be a cheering crowd, would even give them the signs to hold and everything. One thing they all seemed to agree on was that the Middle East is overcome with militant theocrats and the Middle East will only become peaceful when only one group of theocrats remains. They are not too dissimilar than the US except for them their religion is their politics and for the US the politics is the religion."
"Their is nothing the US can do to change the Middle East and except for helping to evacuate non-militant combatants, we shouldn’t be doing anything over there anyway. I mean the US can’t even solve issues in the US, how can we solve other people’s problems if we cannot even solve our own?"
You hear republicans always talking about how they support the 2nd amendment
Do you mean first amendment?
back to grade 4 with me
"I fail to see how it's an attack on our freedom of speech. The constitution protects American citizens, NOT foreign entities. Especially not in an area that has been universally agreed upon as a neutral location. Our constitution means nothing to the UN."
"I get that you want to be able to shout ""Orange man bad"" from the rooftops, but this ain't the hill to die on."
"It's phenomenally wrongheaded to prevent them from access to the UN, just for completely different reasons."
"The constitution protects American citizens, "
"the Constitution and it’s protections apply to <em>all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States of America</em>, not just citizens. "
I cannot believe this has to be said.
UN isnt classified as US jurisdiction. Nor are its officials.
I’m not disputing that. I’m disputing what he said about Constitutional rights.
Fair enough.
... So still not Iran.
I was pointing out the entire premise of his argument is flawed. The Constitution explicitly does protect foreign entities while they are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 
It’s an incredibly important distinction that <em>far too many</em> people don’t know.
"""Non-U.S. citizens have received legal protection under the U.S. Constitution in court cases. Though the Constitution itself does not expressly protect people who are not citizens, courts have extended Fourth, Fifth and 14th Amendment protections to non-citizens in the United States"""
and nowhere in the Constitution does it imply the protections within are only reserved for citizens. It doesn’t make any sense conceptually when you look at the Framers’ intent. 
"The Constitution is a set of rules dictating what the government <em>cannot</em> do to people, not a set of protections certain people have from it."
and nowhere in the Constitution does it imply the protections within are only reserved for citizens
"In fact it makes very explicit when it only applies to citizens, so logically it applies to non citizen's"
"Sees OPs flair, closes thread."
So in other words America doesn't stand for anything outside of the US
Now you're learning.

"I've been called twice and I've done it both times (20 years apart). And I think it is something citizens should do if they are able, when called upon.  It isn't really ""serving the state"" as much as is it is providing a service for your fellow citizens, a service that I'd appreciate should I need it. While our system is far from perfect, having a verdict selected by 12 citizens is certainly preferable to having one handed down by a single politician."
"exactly, juries of citizens were created as a defense against unfair/arbitrary conviction"
"It's like libraries. In reality it's one of the most low key and helpful things that ""the State"" actually does. "
"The only real opposition to it is absolutism in ideology. When people say ""civic duty"", it's usually some bullshit to further imperialism or the police state. But jury duty is so innocuous and helpful to your fellow citizens that to make it about ""the state forcing you do to something,"" only makes you look like a dick. "
"You get paid the same, they give you free breakfast and lunch, and you get to acquit bullshit charges or even invoke jury nullification. And if someone is genuinely guilty of a heinous crime, so be it, that's what you're there for. It's great. It's boring as shit, but so are most people's jobs."
“You get paid the same”
You must not make very much money.
Yup. Most states require only <em>unpaid</em> leave from your employer.
Where I live you are entitled to 45 cents a mile and $12 for parking in my state.  That's it.
Now that is probably the most Libertarian thing you can do: Place someone's worth as a human based on their income provided by their market value.
Quietly nullify the jury if appropriate. 
No victim no crime.
"Jury duty isn't ""mandatory"", you buy in when you register to vote. So I don't know if i call it as being ""forced"" to do something by the state, rather than your number being called after you put it into the draw. "
"it's one of those things that we all want to happen at any of our trials, should we ever face them. I'd want due process with a public trial in front of a jury of my peers - not volunteers. It's not about the state ruling something, it's a jury of citizens deciding something and the state having to deal (most of the time).

"""a check on excessive government"""
"I do like this argument and I never really thought about like that.  With that notion, it's certainly supported by libertarian ideology."
Thanks!
With volunteers.
"Do you think it should pay more then?  $40 a day isn't going to get many people to volunteer.  Also I feel juries would be overly skewed to retirees, which kinda defeats the point of a jury supposedly being representative of the people."
I don’t care about the pay. I think you do jury duty because you should. It’s part of being in society. I don’t have a problem with it at all.
Courts should be in the private se ore and those cases that cannot be settled through arbitration should have professional jurists preside
What a terrible idea.
Only if you think government knows best then everyone else ..
It's a jury of your peers.  The government doesn't have anything to do with it.  That's the point.
"And even if it was the government, I'd still trust them more than <em>paid jurors</em>.  Seriously, what a stupid, terrible idea."
Paid jurors sounds like a great way to buy verdicts

Bombing the Iranian general was the best thing to happen to Trump regarding the impeachment he's currently under.
"Short term it got it out of the news cycle. Long term, a war with Iran is incredibly unpopular. The one and only reason the GOP is protecting trump from impeachment is they are afraid of his popularity with the base, if that wains as he gets us into another Middle East quagmire they will turn on him on a dime."
His base is soft in the head and will leap on the war train along with all the #NeverTrump and Conserva-Dem hold outs that loved George Bush Jr.
Assassination made Trump the kind of President that Americans love.
"Republicans have a hard on for war though.  They love it.  They might pretend to be against it to try to bash Obama but make no mistake, Republicans fucking love war."
Republicans have a hard on for war though. They love it.
"Their voters, many of whom are tired of their kids dying, are less enthusiastic about marching their grandkids off to death in Iran."
And they know it. Roberts (not up for reelection) is the only elected Kansas Republican overly flamboyant about war with Iran. Hes also an old senile man who can literally do whatever he wants since he isnt running. Moran just kept saying soleimoni was killing americans (which is true).
Hawley (Missouri) went on a rant about fiscal responsibility..which was numerous.

This. And no one complains unless it isn't your guy doing the wars. It's funny how who is pro war changes every 4 to 8 years.
"Yup, and thanks to the ""War Powers Act"" Congress gets to blame it on the President instead of taking the responsibility themselves."
Republicans fucking love war.
"With the exception of those who could have Trump piss in their mouth and still vote for him, there are a bunch of conservatives who are tired of war in the middle east and Trump ran on that. I'd imagine it would be unpopular for him. I don't think it'd make those conservative voters turn blue, but a bunch would probably just stay home on voting day."
There's an album of polls that show republican voters will support whatever position a republican president supports while democrats are less likely to adopt the positions of leaders that they would otherwise disagree with.
....was the best thing to happen to Trump...
"Do you mean ""...was a good move by Trump""..."

"Just wrap this impeachment stuff up boys, we've got a war to fight!"

That was his hope from the beginning
Fuck Trump and fuck his shitty escalation with Iran. It's just another symptom of the rotten state of American politics.
What does everyone think the odds are of:
a senate hearing occurring for trump's removal from office
a war with Iran
I'm really not expecting either. I think the impeachment was meant to undermine trump's credibility (lol) and sway undecided voters. And I don't see Iran wanting an actual conflict.

"In North Carolina, election officials used a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to eliminate thousands of suspected noncitizens from the original list of 10,000. Several anecdotal examples in Texas show similar circumstances; one woman, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote last week that she hasn’t renewed her driver’s license since becoming a citizen in 2016 because it does not expire until 2020 — so her records with the state are outdated."
The goal is to continue to make these claims after every losing election cycle in order to delegitimize the opposition.
"While I admit that's a lot less-scary than data flowing in the <em>opposite</em> direction, it's still part of the same set of sneaky ulterior motives."
"<a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-citizenship-question-could-break-the-census/"">Statisticians know more questions isn't always better science too.</a>"
Any relationship between these two should be suspect. The census is enshrined in the constitution and tbh should be given a much higher and more importance place in our politics than it is. Homeland Security is straight up just a vehicle for government overreach.
"Of course we don't want anyone with an illegal immigrant in the family to complete the census form, otherwise they would get representation in government"
"This is a really really strange take to me. The natural assumption is that illegals do not vote, correct? So proportional representation doesn't help represent them at all, it increases the value of legal citizens who live in States with high populations of illegal immigrants. I'm not making a case either way but I don't understand how you arrived at your conclusion"
This whole thing with linking the census and citizenship is designed to make people not respond for fear of they answer that they have family members who are illegal in the country they'll be deported.
"By undercounting these people, who are both citizens and noncitizens, it gives more congressional seats, electoral votes, and federal funding to states with less illegal immigrants"
So legal citizens who are like living with illegal citizens? I don't understand why they can't just not include the illegal members of their family on their form. 
"Additionally, you say that the design of it is to cause the reaction that you state and such a reaction is not a byproduct of people's choice to break the law."
I guess what I am trying to say is why SHOULD an area be given more representation and particularly more federal funding based on illegal immigrant populations?
"Because the Constitution says representation is based on people not citizens, also it makes policy better when we know how many people are in an area not just how many citizens."
"Not including them on the form would be falsifying the census form which is a crime, not filling it out at all isnt"
"In other words, the census will not be accurate and areas with a high population of illegal citizens will get screwed out of federal money"
"That doesn't make any sense. Unless I missed a constitutional amendment excluding illegals from census data, the DHS providing this data won't affect the numbers at all."
"People won’t count themselves (or family, etc.) who are illegal if they know that the DHS is getting the data. That’s the whole issue with the citizenship question trump wanted"
good
"Um....how is it a ""good"" thing to ignore the Constitution and apportion based on flawed counts? "
"It's enshrined in the Constitution. If you don't like it, amend the Constitution. I'm sick of seeing Conservatives wipe their asses with our founding documents."

"The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit research organization founded in 1985. It is the nation's only think tank devoted exclusively to research and policy analysis of the economic, social, demographic, fiscal, and other impacts of immigration on the United States."
They're the ones that claim immigrants cost hundreds of billions of dollars based on imaginary math
They're well known for being pure garbage
Oh so just calling themselves non-partisan makes it so?
I guess I need to rethink my opinion on the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
CIS is a fucking joke.
"They're the ones that are constantly claiming that illegal immigrants get huge amounts of welfare, which is not in any way true. They're a pay-to-lie workshop whose entire purpose is to lie to you so that you can keep on believing the xenophobic, unconstitutional bullshit you want to be true."
MPI is the actual immigration think tank. CIS just lies about their findings.
"Overall, we rate CIS a questionable source based on publishing misleading information (propaganda) regarding immigration, as well as ties either directly or indirectly to the John Tanton Network, who is a known White Nationalist. "

There are literally <strong>paragraphs</strong> after the SPLC citation explaining why CIS is horseshit. Even CATO has debunked them.
"The SPLC is a biased flagger, and Google knows this and uses them anyway. This is a real problem as it amplifies the extent of their mislabeling. I bring this up as a separate topic, and I bring this up to challenge the assessment of CIS as a white nationalist publisher and think tank. That is not a fair assessment."
"Their historical methodology is problematic, but I have a real issue with this lefty tactic of finding some flaw in publication body in the past and dismissing without thought on a categorical basis anything that comes out in the future. The ideas at hand in the present argument either stand or fall on their own, and the history of the organization that employs the present author has no bearing on it."
"There are entire sections of the internet being cordoned off by the censorship heavy left, who seeks to insulate the world from any idea that does not fit their narrative, and they make far more mistakes in this branding than they do any kind of objective service for the good.

"""I play both sides, that way I always come out on top!"""
WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME THAT
“You just told us”!!
IMO we need a Constitutional amendment requiring bills to be granular. That seems hard to quantify though.
Line item veto would be similar I think. But your suggestion seems better.
Line item veto effectively gives the president the ability to make budgets instead of congress. Bad idea. The executive should never have the power to make laws.
"Gotcha, thanks. I knew there was a reason why it wasn't a thing.  We do need something to do 5 pork-barreling."
"This may seem like a stupid question, but if we get enough petitions signed could we make it a voted on issue on the national level?"
"There's been 125 military conflicts, only 5 have had congressionally backed declarations"
They both want that power so whenever their party controls the White House they can do what they please.

"LOL, those ""war-mongering"" Democrats...AIR?"
"I mean. Yeah. Pelosi was one of the first people who approved use of ""enhanced interrogation"" Obamas drone strike programs put Trump and Bush to shame, Clintons administration put troops on the ground for ""covert"" operstions in so many countries in shocked we didnt start World War 3 in the 90s. The DNC and the GOP are no different when it comes to getting paid from war. They both support the patriot act (which rhe DNC just helped renew during the ""impeachment"") they both support less oversight on intelligence, they both support expansion of military supply and assets. "
The Democrats are no better when it comes to starting or remaining in conflict.
"They are the uniparty. All love the military industrial complex. 
Anyone who pretends the Democratic Party is the party of peace is kidding themselves. At least Republicans don’t veil their intent."
"Neither party has ever been anti war...however, liberal media only speaks of Republican led war and covers up or does not admit Democrat warmongering. That is why most Democrats think their party is so morally superior to the rest of the world. Leftist media suppression and propaganda works very well to rewrite reality... very effective indeed...This sub is clear proof."
"unfortunately, yes."
"You right, the whole death-by-drone thing is brand new. Obama never did anything like that. /s"
Precisely this. Either you look like a weakling or a warmonger. Much safer to let the executive deal with it and then praise/criticize depending on the outcome and the mood in the country.
"Also, there is a fundamental thing that people seem to forget -- nuclear weapons. Let's say, the enemy suddenly launches their intercontinental ballistic missiles. Congress simply just wouldn't have time to react, we're talking about a window of 10-20 minutes at most. Therefore, for US deterrence to be taken seriously, the power to order an american nuclear strike had to be concentrated in the hands of one person, ie the president. So, we give him or her the power to extinguish hundreds of millions of lives in an afternoon, but not the power to start a minor police action?"
Potus has always had the football
This is nonsense. The AUMF has nothing whatever to do with nuclear weapons. The US maintained nuclear deterrence for decades before the AUMF.

"Well yeah, for the exact reason you outlined. In an enemy nuclear strike, millions of lives are on the line with a very narrow window to respond to avert that crisis. What comparable emergency is there that necessitates the president having the authority to order a drone strike on a ranking military official of a nation with whom we are not officially at war?"
"Hell, libertarians of all people should have no problem grasping this logic. We're all about separation of powers and denying the government or specific branches of government powers that fans of big government might view as ""logical"" extensions of the powers the government already has. If the president can launch a nuclear strike practically on a whim, why can't he just confiscate all civilian weaponry to prevent an uprising, or heavily restrict the press to ensure that views sympathetic to the enemy or views detrimental to the nation aren't expressed? Because the government doesn't have that power, because that power is expressly <em>forbidden</em> to the government. Likewise, the President (if our republic were working properly) couldn't just go and launch new police actions willy-nilly even if he can nuke someone just because he's bored."
What comparable emergency is there that necessitates the president having the authority to order a drone strike on a ranking military official
"You're concentrating just on nukes. There were two arguments there, the other being that Congress doesn't want this power in reality. Nukes are just there to highlight part of the logic as to why Congress is okay with this, besides being cowardly and irresponsible"
"Let's say, the enemy suddenly launches their intercontinental ballistic missiles. Congress simply just wouldn't have time to react"
"I think there is a difference in ""defend an imminent threat"" lets's say, by preventing the missile from hitting the ground and a counter attack"
"Those are very different thing, and as a libertarian you shouldn't undermine them"
Just spitballing here but perhaps they should place the powers for nuclear weapons in the hand of the Vice President. Given that he is the president of the Senate and therefore could act swiftly and within the powers of the constitution. Not saying it’s even correct or anything but it’s a way to think differently.
Term limits would be fabulous.  Hopefully it’d help them stop thinking about themselves and re-election
Ya idk if that would really change all that much. Just transfer power from elected officials to unelected bureaucrats.
Term limits empower the executive and unelected staffers and lobbyists.
"Eh, in practice term limits tend to empower the party machinery at the expense of the individual elected officials. I think it might be more successful if the two parties weren't so entrenched in the power structure; if some reforms were enacted that greatly reduced party influence, particularly if it led to additional parties holding some actual influence, then term limits might be more successful."
100% this
The whole Obama-Syria episode illustrates this pretty explicitly.
They just renewed the executive branches rights to carry out these attacks and then turn around and complain about it
Politicians are do nothing slimeballs
Woah woah woah. That's preposterous.
Doing nothing would be an improvement. Politicians are active participants in creating negative outcomes.

I concur .. any military deployments for any reason outside the borders of the US require either a formal declaration fo War from both Houses or  Letters of Marque &amp; Reprisal by both Houses

YARRRGH!!!
"Formal declaration of war is just burdensome government regulation. Let the people decide who they want to invade by letting every american own a tank, a jet and a nuclear device and let the free market decide which country to wreck."

"Don’t you think it’s to everyone’s advantage to require that even just a few people (other than people who serve at POTUS’ pleasure) double-check his decision to assassinate a military and political leader of a country with which we aren’t at war? It’s an act of war. I don’t care if he tells everyone in congress, but he should at least have checked-in with the armed services committees, or the foreign relations committees, or even just the majority and minority leadership."
"How about a rescue mission?  Congress is adjourned, a bus load of American tourists are kidnapped by terrorists. 
Before the Blackhawks with marines can be deployed, congress must be gaveled back into session, and both houses pass a letter. 
And... all the hostages are dead. "
How long does international tourism last after that?  A week?
"Yes, in situations where time is of the essence, of course we should be able to act without Congressional approval. For any prolonged deployment of forces, there should be a Congressional Declaration of War. I don't think anyone is saying that we should have to wait on Congress to deploy a team to rescue hostages or shoot down incoming missiles or whatever other time-sensitive strawmen people are going to throw out in these threads."
"That’s not what the post above says. It says <em>any</em> deployment for <em>any</em> reason. 
It doesn’t say “except when time is of the essence”. You know, like finding Iran’s head terrorist out in the open like an idiot..."

"It's an interesting academic argument, but the problem with the underlying assumption of the whole article:"

Is that we no longer live in a world where conflict between powers is clearly demarcated.
"Countries routinely attack each other's interests using various covert and conventional means with plausible deniability.

"Unless you're of the view that the United States should immediately adopt Switzerland's foreign policy, regardless of the geopolitical consequences, then it cannot be practical to have every engagement with a hostile power become a political issue that is discussed and debated in the open."
"The constitution does give congress the right to declare war, but it also gives the president the right to conduct it. And in a world where war has become an increasingly intangible concept, only the latter part still matters."
I'm of the view that the US should immediately adopt Switzerland's foreign policy.

"You're right.  It does not.  Which is why a strong defense is necessary.  If we kept founders intent of ""Ally with no one, trade with everyone"" do you really think the US would be worse off than it is now, with most of the Middle East wanting to kill us?"
"Problem is, what is defence in the age of globalization?"
"Let's hypthetically suppose that we have a fanatical enemy that wants to destroy the American way of life, and that this enemy is building nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. What should the defence be? Simply nuclear deterrence? What if that enemy doesn't care about it for some reason. That's just one example."
"This isnt the 1890s, when all you needed to prevent major harm to America was a good fleet."
Why does this fanatical enemy want to destroy us?
"I mean, seriously, if we were totally neutral, we probably wouldn't have an enemy.  I can count on one hand the number of enemies that Switzerland has and still have 4 fingers and a thumb left over."
Why does this fanatical enemy want to destroy us?
Hypothetically? Could be for no rational reason. Why did Hitler believe that the world was controlled by a Jewish conspiracy?
"if we were totally neutral, we probably wouldn't have an enemy. "
"The historic record doesn't support this statement whatsoever. If nothing else, 'neutrals' still have resources that can be taken away."
"Ok, then please tell me who the enemies of Switzerland are?  Heck, even Nazi Germany did not invade and conquer Switzerland."
"Fanatical Muslims would absolutely destroy Switzerland if given the chance.  They believe their god told them to kill all non-believers, and they are working toward that goal every day."
Fanatical Muslims would absolutely destroy Switzerland if given the chance.
"Yet somehow there haven't been any terrorist bombing in Switzerland or anti-Swiss rhetoric coming out of their mouths.  Have you ever heard a radical Muslim scream ""Those Swiss Infidels must die!!!"""
Did you know the Ottoman Empire used to keep fanatical Muslims in check?  The Caliph used to regularly round them up and have them executed.
"Then we toppled the Ottoman empire in WW I, and suddenly radical Islam took off."
"It will however, make Americans magically stop dying in shitholes overseas "
"Switzerland has a surprisingly high foreign born Muslim population and yet they’ve never ever had a single Muslim terrorist attack, and why would they? They haven’t been meddling in the Middle East and everyone is happy for the privilege to live there"
make Americans magically stop dying in shitholes overseas 
And then a crapton of them can die at home when some hitler builds up enough muscle.
Switzerland has a surprisingly high foreign born Muslim population and yet they’ve never ever had a single Muslim terrorist attack
"You're wrong, look up El Al Flight 433 and Swissair Flight SR33."
"Furthermore, it's strange to single out a small part of the western world. That's like saying ""look at Cleveland, it never had a Muslim terror attack, the entire western world should be like Cleveland!"""
El Al Flight 433 and Swissair Flight SR33
"El Al Flight 432 and Swissair Flight SR330 actually.
Seems like they were targeted because the destination was Israel, not for Switzerland directly."
"So, Swiss aren't allowed to have flights to Israel? So much for neutrality!"
"Point is, being isolationist doesn't make the rest of the world magically disappear."
As someone who is from the 'rest of the world' We want fucking libertarianism too. The idea that you can't adopt a foreign policy similar to swedens 'because the rest of the world exists' is just silly.
"Sweden was extremely agressive until recent couple or centuries, because of losses in the wars against russia. Furthermore, their neutrality wouldn't save them in WWII if they even for a second disrupted export of iron ore to Nazi Germany, just ask Norway. Furthermore, sweden has an extremely well developed military industrial complex. Furthermore, sweden is part of a western world, and lives in a world where the superpower is relatively benevolent by old standards -- military might of US guarantees freedom of shipping, etc."
"Sweden was extremely agressive until recent couple or centuries, because of losses in the wars against russia.  "
"Completely irrelevant. We can completely remove the word Sweden then. Lets just go with, Non-militaristic foreign policy."
​
"Furthermore, their neutrality wouldn't save them in WWII if they even  for a second disrupted export of iron ore to Nazi Germany, just ask  Norway. "
And actively attacking Germany would have been even fucking worse. That's what a militaristic foreign policy would have lead too. They would have been even more fucked up.
Sweden
You’re forgetting the Swedish Empire under Karl XII (Carolus Rex)
"Sweden in its current form was just an example some on else used, so i was using it back to them."
That's not what he meant.
"I see, so it's better to have continuous wars to avoid war."
"Continuous <em>small</em> wars to avoid a <em>big</em> war, or even a straight up annihilation of your society? Yes, it is."
That’s why should only engage in proxy’s and other then that use our SOCOM assets
"The war powers resolution and constitution limit the ability to declare war to congressional power, so simply put, allowing the executive to enter wars without congressional approval is unconstitutional."
"I'm aware that the ""war on terror"" is used to justify almost all US military action in the Middle East, but as libertarians, we should be dedicated to preventing further american involvement in the Middle East, unless we are directly attacked. "
"Just because the status-quo is a policy of endless war, doesn't mean we should accept it. Additionally, there are a million degrees of limited intervention between our current forign policy and Switzerland's forign policy. Most of the proxy groups we fund are a detriment to national security, and destabilize regions just enough to justify increased DOD funding for defense contractors. "
"Looks at what's happened in Iraq, Yemen, and Libya. Both the dems and Republicans will try to continue the endless conflicts that contribute nothing to the betterment of American society. A policy of just not getting involved could easily have been achieved if we resisted interventionism, and it would have left those countries and America better off."
"I think you're making an intelligent counterargument. I'll admit I don't know the details of how Congress works, so I'm open to corrections, but I don't agree. Specifically, let's start with:"
"Countries routinely attack each other's interests using various covert and conventional means with plausible deniability. Is it war when China hacks our government databases or when Russia tries to mess with our elections? Is it war when we invade Pakistan to kill Bin Laden, or Syria to kill al-Baghdadi?"
"Agreed. The definition of ""war"" is no longer as clear as it used to be. But then you write..."
it cannot be practical to have every engagement with a hostile power become a political issue that is discussed and debated in the open.
"Why not? Clearly the US can't debate every single drone strike and introduce a separate bill allowing each individual strike, but can't it form Congressional committees that coordinate with the DoD to maintain broad oversight over these operations? That is, the president (and by extension the secretary of defense, and by extension the Department of Defense) ought to come up with plans, and discuss all major ones (including each individual drone strike) in committee meetings, and for contentious operations, Congress would have final say. Perhaps the law would contain a guarantee that the representation of each political party on the committee should be proportional to their representation in Congress (although I can see this coming with its own problems -- that would require recognition of political parties in law... and what to do about independents?) Their legitimacy would come not from the president, but from Congressional legislation granting the president authority to conduct all operations of a class subject to oversight."
"Its only not practical if we want to keep engaging in all these proxy wars, which is the whole point."
"You use the term ""war"", which obfuscates the entire discussion. As noted in my previous post, adversarial nations engage with each other in a wide variety of ways, spying, sabotage, subversion, assassination, etc. to the point where a binary war/peace understanding of international relations is almost anachronistic in 2020."
"We currently have a lot of national interests all over the world, and thus need to protect them. Iran attacked them enough times that the president saw fit to punch back and tell them to stop."
"If your view is that we should abandon all our overseas interests and alliances and adopt a policy of strict neutrality, that's your prerogative. But that's not the world we currently live in, and trying to get there by using parliamentary mechanisms to make our current interests and alliances untenable is both unwise and will be counter-productive to that desire in the long run."
Needing congressional approval to kill a foriegn official of a country we are not at war with doesn't mean we have to give up our interests.
It would absolutely hurt the success of any sort of action. You think it's a good idea to just advertise covert military actions on C-SPAN? And Congress is supposed to be open and transparent. You can't have that AND make it a central part of military action.  
Not to mention the political bickering and whatnot.  The President is in charge of the military because the framers (as did the Romans) recognized the need to have a single man in charge of military actions so they could be done quickly and without politicking.
"You can distinguish between carrying out a course of action towards a congressionally approved goal, and getting approval for the goal itself."
"The point is that it isn't Congress' place to approve specific military actions.  They have the ability to declare war, but they don't and shouldn't have the final say on specific actions.  The President shouldn't need to ask Congress' permission to punish a foreign entity.  That's literally his job, to command the military and act as a single liaison with other nations."
"I'm not saying that they need to approve specific actions, I'm saying they need to approve acting towards some goal or within some set of parameters, which should be as narrowly defined as possible."
"But that defeats the entire purpose of having the President be in charge of the military and executive branch.  Congress doesn't have to ask the President for permission to make laws, and can override a veto.  It seems as though you just want to move powers from the executive to the legislative."
"Once Congress declares war, the president can do whatever he wants"
"You keep using that term, ""war"", which is meaningless in this context. We've had a hostile relationship with Iran since 1979 which translated into multiple direct and indirect military engagements."
"That aside, how would the president go about getting approval from Congress for such a thing? Ask a friendly House rep and Senator to introduce bills to that effect? Surely you do not believe that such a course of action would be viable."
We are not in a declared war with them. That is what I mean. 
"You wouldn't need approval for every single action, but you could make the approval process much more granular that it currently is."
There's a reason that the system of checks and balances was adopted from ancient Rome. There's a reason for only Congress proposing laws and the Senate approving them into force. This meant they any war proposal was properly debated. Having Congress have that ability is the correct way to do it esp when lives are at stake on both sides.
"How do you have an open debate on things such as ""we think Bin Laden is hiding in a compound in Pakistan, should we send a Seal team to kill him?"""
"Er,..by simply having that debate."
Congress does have the power to declare war.  But the President has the ability to initiate military action and must withdraw if Congress doesn't give approval.
"Yea, so, the question is whether Congress should take back control?"
"This is an issue of them usurping the powers of the executive, not regaining lost powers."
Is that we no longer live in a world where conflict between powers is clearly demarcated.
The legal consequences of the AUMF are better demarcated: it means the executive can legally use the military force of the USA to kill anyone. The justification for killing Anwar al-Awlaki was that he was an AQ propagandist.
"You should read Federalist 70, they kinda frame it as though in emergency situations the executive has full control, but congress should deliberate when there is less of a immediate threat"
Trump cultist argues that the president should have full power with no accountability. Shocking. 
Never believe that a Trump supporter ever cares about anything but power. At all. Ever.
The greatest thing about Trump is that he has shown everyone why you want to limit the power of the President. For years the establishment has increased the power of the President because they knew any power they gave to an opposition President would be available to them when their party took the Presidency. Now that Trump is President they are starting to realize the problem with this and how the President has way too much power to unilaterally wage war. Politicians only seem to learn things the hard way
The greatest thing about Trump is that he has shown everyone why you want to limit the power of the President
"This didnt change anything. Instead of thinking ""hey, maybe the government had too much control"" they're thinking ""shame we don't have that control, can't wait to get it back"""
More like 'we don't want that control back which is why we gave it to the president in the first place but we'll pretend to care to make ourselves look good for elections.'
They aren't starting to realize it. They knew it all along. Trump just isn't doing what they want him to with it.
He isn't? I'm pretty sure he's doing exactly what military and energy interests want him to do. Just like every President in damn near a centry.
The greatest thing about Trump is that he has shown everyone why you want to limit the power of the President. 
"In 2016, I had mentioned this to friends as a possible silver lining of an otherwise disastrous Trump presidency. The next three years forced me to eat those words. I was wrong to assume the Republican congressmen at <em>least</em> had a sense of identity/pride in their own legislative institution, and would seek to protect it as an independent branch of government."
The Republican party will never <em>publicly</em> censure Trump like that unless he's already doomed among their voters. They will continue to exclaim that the emperor has the brightest and best new clothes up until the very end.
"In short, there is no reason to expect that pattern will change now. I will be pleased if it happens, but I don't expect that to occur."
"This was one of the “worst case scenarios” for voting for Trump. “Worst case, he serves as an example for the Presidency having too much power”"
"When Trump was elected, my big hope was that the left would claw back a bunch of presidential powers like the AUMF. This is a small beacon of hope that we may see that happen, but for the most part they just seem focused on how they can get power back and prevent the next Trump from being elected."
They assumed it would always be a uniparty controlled shill in the white house.  That's why they hate President Trump so much; it was supposed to be her turn.
Two problems with this.
"First, Congress doesn't really want this. This isn't a fun responsibility, like deciding who gets what pork. This is a choice between looking like a pansy and looking like a warmonger. They're perfectly happy to let the executive branch deal with this, and then criticize it when things go wrong."
"Second, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles cardinally changed the equation. With the response times to the enemy nuclear strike in the tens of minutes, Congress simply cannot react. Therefore, the power to use our nuclear weapons has to be in the hands of one man so that our enemies know there is a credible retaliation threat. And it is plain silly to give the president the power to extinguish the lives of hundreds of millions of people, but then in order to kill some foreign terrorist in a foreign country or start a minor police action the president would have to get a permission from Congress."
"Or criticize when things go right, because no matter how successful a strike against terrorists is, some politician will spin it saying the strike was “unnecessary” and “starting a war”.  "
There is no winning when a terrorist is killed.  Some will always cheer and others will boo.
Mayor Pete's policy of automatic 3 year sunsets of all AUMFs is actually pretty good.
We'll renew the AUMF just like we renew the NDAA.
The issue is the politicians as much as the policy.
"Also how they attach things to other bills as riders.  Like sure pass this massive spending bill to keep government grinding to a halt, but we'll also have it renew shit like the Patriot Act.  It's not just the politicians, though certainly having them basically constantly campaign instead of actually doing their fucking jobs is an issue."
Repeal the 17th ammendment.
Abolish the Senate
I am the senate
What about nuclear engagements? There just isnt enough time.
You only have 15 minutes to respond.
That's the entire purpose of the war powers act.
"I understand that. But the article is calling for the repeal of that act, from what I can see."
"So do we take back war making powers, or do we make an exception for nukes?"
No it isn't. The article is calling for the repeal of the AUMF. It doesn't even mention the War Powers Act.
"It’s necessary, but there’s a lot of room for abuse which can be rewritten to prevent"
"You can pass the act that says you can only retaliate with nukes, never strike first"
So this is digging deep into nuclear deterrence theory.
"What you described is current usa policy, as far as I am aware. But someone still has to decide to push the proverbial button. And if you only have 5 or 10 minutes, that likely isn't enough to rouse Congress."
"Sure maybe we can have Congress pass some laws dictating when the president can do it, but then we are still relying on the president's judgement at the moment."
Responding to nukes with Nukes is fucking stupid and is the most irresponsible thing you can do.
And ironically the best policy to have.
Mutually assured destruction is a proven method of slowing down the use of nuclear weapons.
In case you haven't noticed Congress doesn't want them.
"Yes and no. I think what trump did this time was fine. Someone attacked our embassy, marines took  it back and they killed the man organizing it. That should be fine. "
"What bush, Obama and trump have done for the last nearly 20 years has been largely unacceptable but people picking this one where our people were attacked and the president handled the situation. "
This being the shining example of why the executive branch has to much power is as stupid as those black lives matter groups rallying behind a thug who beat up a shopkeeper and attacked police. 
Pick your hill to die on.
"Pelosi doesnt want to repeal the AUMF. She wants to keep it in place so that she can complain about whatever actions Trump takes under it.  Draw down troops? Complain! Increase troops? Complain! Attack? Dont attack? Complain, complain, complain! Congress doesnt want power. They just want to whine about those they have given it to."
Yeah let's instead give it to a group of corrupt people with more leaks than a fucking colander.
I approve of the strike.  They attacked the United States and we simply can’t allow nations to think they can commit such an act without repercussions
"I mean, yeah. But in this one specific instance, I actually think Trump was Justified. First a disclaimer: I’m extremely anti-war, anti-interventionist. If I had my way, I’d scale back our brick-and-mortar military/intelligence presence world-wide a cool 90-99%. "
"HOWEVER, Soleimani attacked US soil. Full Stop. You wanna kill US occupying forces? Well, not cool, but at least there’s an argument to be had about the legitimacy of said occupation and the rights of those being occupied to use deadly force to regain their own sovereignty. "
"However, an embassy is not an occupying force. It’s sovereign soil, and a legitimate necessity for international relations. Attacks on embassies should met with the at let least same swiftness and ferocity as an attack on Guam or Puerto Rico."
Call me crazy but I think it might make protecting our assets a little more difficult if the use of force needs to go through a committee first
"Not if Obama was still president, huh?"
Killing a terrorist with a drone is not “war-making powers”.  So there is nothing to “take back” or “repeal”.
"My favorite question to ask, is where the hell was this person, and why wasn’t he complaining about this exact same thing when the president he liked was in power? Bunch of fucking hypocrites."
This is National review...
Right? Near complete silence when a Doctors without Borders hospital was bombed to shit in 2015.
"A few military personnel directly involved with an attack on American soil tho? Huge problem, all media outlets running 24/7 hit pieces."
I love how they want to do this NOW.  Where was this when all the other presidents did this?  Why does it take getting the vilest man ever to hold the Oval Office for them to suddenly realize they've been asleep at the wheel ?
"I hope they do, but i dont thnk they can/will with the neocons in charge."
"There are only two political parties in government and they both want unilateral powers ""in case shit"" happens. This will be a thing until more political parties start getting into federal positions."
Where was  this democratic opinion while Obama was in office?
National Review.
"This is something that Tulsi Gabbard has been focusing on - by speaking out, and introducing appropriate legislation."
"<a href=""https://www.congress.gov/member/tulsi-gabbard/G000571?r=1&amp;q=%7B%22sponsorship%22:%22sponsored%22%7D&amp;searchResultViewType=expanded"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.congress.gov/member/tulsi-gabbard/G000571?r=1&amp;q={%22sponsorship%22:%22sponsored%22}&amp;searchResultViewType=expanded</a>"
I don't think this is a bad idea but Presidents can only start a war for 90(or 60 not sure) days. That's not that extreme a thing
"60 days of unauthorized action followed by a 30 day grace period to withdraw troops, totalling 90 days."
Yeah that sounds right
"If all AUMF’s are repealed, what does that actually mean?"
"If another embassy is attacked, does Congress have to declare war on the terrorists before the President can respond?<br/>
What if a hostile congress refuses to give the president war powers?"
Do we then just watch helplessly while Americans are dragged through the streets and beheaded?
"Which American would ever again travel overseas?  Who would be an ambassador?  I would never set foot in Mexico again I’ll tell you that, my career be damned. 
I’m not going to get kidnapped by the cartel for ransom and then have idiot progressives in Congress virtue signal that they won’t declare war on “brown people”."
that's an interesting warhawk talking point you have
"A counterattack against the people that were specifically trying to murder American citizens within our own embassy (sovereign American soil) does not require a declaration of war. Trump, while being bad (and admittedly orange), was well within his legal purview. I honestly believe he was constitutionally obligated to respond with some kind of force, since he is the head of our executive branch and military and American lives were at risk. He would be facing far more criticism if he just left them there to die, which is exactly what would have happened if we didn't respond. Unless you are suggesting we should have just tucked our tail between our legs and abandoned our embassy in a country that was being infiltrated by a hostile foreign military. "
No one who is criticizing Trump for this action has posed a single viable alternative that I know of. Diplomacy fails when you are trying to talk to someone with a gun pointed at your head.
Lol you guys love Iranian mass murderers
Lol.  You love endless wars that result in mass murders.
"I am confused what endless war are we in now because of this? Do we have troops on the ground in Iran? No, well I guess you are wrong go worship Obama and all his congressionally sanctioned drone strikes."
Apparently you worship Obama and all his drone strikes.    I do not.
Again what war are we in now? And I don't worship Obama but he had every right to drone strike whomever he wanted just like Trump. Did we start a war when Obama was striking Lybia? What about now in Kenya? Diplomacy has its limits and unfortunately we can't live like an isolationist.
'Obama had every right to drone strike who ever he wanted'.
We are done.  Fuck off.
Our congress currently has terrorist allies in it.
And I’m not just talking about the brother fucker.
We need a full purge.
Alliances with terrorists have been a staple of American diplomacy for decades lol
That’s not even related to what I said. Go be a woke retard somewhere else.
Just putting your angsty teenage political fantasies in perspective
You’re so woke bro.
[deleted]
A draft doesn't exist
Is that the same nancy polesi that was trying to pass a bill on gun control?.
Take them back? They just renewed them. I doubt they would recant now.
The Marines report directly to the president always have. The president has never needed permission to deploy them.
Yep.  This.
I disagree.
The best thing Trump is doing is showing how Congress has passed on too much of power to the executive branch.
"This might be the one good take to come out of <em>NatRev</em> *checks notes* shit, <em>ever.</em>"
Genuine question here from someone conflicted on this issue: what do you think will happen if the US doesn't intervene and prevent enemy superpowers from exploring their interests unchecked? Are you okay watching innocent people suffer?
"I also want to drastically reduce defense spending and think scaling back our involvement is a major part of that, but there's concerns."
I think the US has been doing a very poor job of policing the planet and has caused more problems than it has or ever will solve through interventions and preemptive military incursions like Iraq and Afghanistan or toppling governments over the last 60 years.
"Republicans are obstructionists and have been for some time. I doubt that there will be any changes until they lose the Senate as well. We need more than two political parties but we don't know how to get out from under corporate control of politics. Instead we get the same group of chicken hawks that have been screwing the pooch, wagging the dog, burning through money and in general repeating the same mistakes."
"Yes, but not this Congress!"
Why not?
"If you repeal the AUMF, you're with the terrorists."
"Also, Trump will continue to say it's legal and do it anyway."
"The AUMF needs to be repealed so that the people can decide the actions of our own forign policy. Keeping government actions determined by the outcomes of democratic elections is what's needed. Saying anyone that's anti-war is ""with the terrorists"" is a neocon talking point, not something any self respecting libertarian would advocate."
We the public will never and frankly should never be given all potential foreign policy information especially when discussing military action. You shouldn’t tell your opponent your strategy
When has Trump ever told the truth?
"If you repeal the AUMF, you're with the terrorists"
"Hi there, Sith"
That wasn't war that was taking out a terrorist and a mass murderer. Whine more
Fuck off red cap
Republicans are more extreme than both combined.  They worry more about what other people are doing than anyone else I'm exposed to.
"Honestly, my personal experience is both republicans and Democrats are very busy interfering in your life public and private."
"Which one claims to be liberal?  The liberal movement has always been about letting people do what they want as long as they don't harm others.  One political party has legislated sexual relationships, drug use, marriage, etc. and that party isn't the Democratics.  The Republicans think it's more important for you to be able to kill people than to let you marry someone of the same gender."
"I agree the Republicans are bad, but the Democrats are not saints. Democrats increase taxes. This is an issue of property rights. It's essentially slavery. The average person pays approximately 50 percent of their income in taxes. Democrat Jimmy Carter reinstituted the draft registration. Conscription is the greatest violation of your rights. However, both sides are guilty of that violation. Many Democrats are pushing for restrictions on free speech and second amendment rights. Democrats have also passed legislation violating free association. I could go on. When choosing between the two, you are choosing which rights you want to restrict."
"Nobody, not even a group of people, are perfect.  Hence the need for a government that must answer to the governed."
Currently the republicans are worse.  They're blocking everything the house does and prevents government from functioning correctly.
"Your first mistake is thinking that being ""extreme"" is bad. Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.  Moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue"
"Sorry, but to me that's just a platitude. There's no extreme. There are only arguments that build a case for a position, and measurable outcomes."
Clearly Libertarians are the most extreme. Every one of their view points has zero evidence actually works in the real world.
"Shit on AOC and Dems as much as you want, at least they have examples in the real world of their ideas working."
Not sure why I have to explain this but... no most Democrats do not wear vagina hats.
What you said is completely wrong.  Libertarianism generally encompasses free markets and limited government.  Both of which are extremely and clearly supported by historical precedents.
AOC and dems pushing for big government and full employment stimulus like the Green New Deal are operating entirely opposite of what history has shown leads to long term economic success.
"The development of Sweden is a great example, illustratting both approaches."
"<a href=""https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich</a>"
Somehow libertarianism.org doesn't sound like it would be an unbiased take on the issue.
I don't blame you for being weary of bias with the political press we have today.  The essay is cited and builds its arguement from data.  The website is run by the Cato Institute.
Feel free to post anything that contradicts the sources in the essay.
"Why are you still on <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>? Fuck off statist"
"Sure, and most libertarians don't strip on stage. "
Do you have specific libertarian ideas that you can point to that don't work?
extreme hats.... lol
"maybe... ""Tax is Theft""... Scares them both?"
Libertarians are more radical because the implementation of their broad policy platform would require radical changes to the structure of government.
"Democrats are arguably more extreme in their handling of governance.  Their policy prescriptions are less grounded in economic history, and more a continuing contortion of current government institution with the intention of serving their political interests."
Can you explain that? I'm not sure what you mean when you say libertarian broad policy platform would require radical changes to government.
"Starting with government revenue.  Income and sales taxes are not consistent with free markets and individual liberty.  Switching to land value and pigouvian taxes would be so radical a change, no politician would consider undertaking it."
"<a href=""https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/04/the-geolibertarian-ethics-of-land-rent/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/04/the-geolibertarian-ethics-of-land-rent/</a>"
"Government spending would be radically reappropriated to incorporate school choice and freedom of information to the masses.  Forced savings in the form of social security, medicare and payroll taxes would be dwindled to nothing."
The Justice system would be vastly smaller with tort reform and allowance for individual choices in medication.
"Okay, got it. You're correct. A mass implementation is unrealistic. It'd have to be slow and measured to work."
Democrats generally claim themselves to be sociologists ( center left )  and democratic socilaists  ( moderate left )  .... Libertarianism is a center-right ideology ...
"Libertarianism isn't a right ideology.  It's anti-authority ideology.  The right is pro-business authority and anti-government authority.  The left is anti-business authority and pro government authority.  A ""true"" libertarian hates be subjected to both private interests and government interests.  I don't think removing all power from government removes any abuse of authority from the world; it transfers it to private interests.  The pendulum swings too far either way and things go bad."
"Right Wing ideologies ( Libertarianism, Minarchism, Communalism, Republicanism, Anarchism ) have tenets that are opposite of the left such as  - free market economies ( like in the US from 1878 till 1913 ) which government does not interfere or regulate, the currency is controlled by private mints and is sound ( gold and silver ) and/or sometimes allows competing currencies ( US Colonies per-Revolutionary War ), they believe in free trade between in individuals and businesses with no government involvement, they believe in individualism and have a disdain for identity politics that collectivizes people into groups, they do not try to attempt to control any aspect of the individual as long as the individual is not harming others ( Libertarian party creed ), and if they CHOOSE to have a government that government cannot perform any acts that citizens cannot ( Example : citizens cant steal and so government cant tax )"
Umm no.  Market economies aren't either right or left.  Market socialism is a thing.  Government sponsored capitalism is a thing.  The two are blurry and very similar in nature with the variation only being whether owners are benefited or the people as a whole are benefited.  Free trade is not a right mentality.  It's not a left mentality.
The difference between the right and the left on an economic basis is the concept of ownership.  Public goods vs private goods.  Public property vs private property.
Controlling the individual is independent of the left and right spectrum for the most part as well.  The leftists see lack of economic opportunity as a severe control over the poor.  The right see government restrictions on property as a severe control over the rich.
"The idea of ""harm"" depends very much on the basis upon which the concept of ""property"" exists.  The left and right agree that individual's should not be damaged in their personage.  They don't entirely agree what damage constitutes in regards to property."
"1878 to 1913 was a terrible time to be a poor person in the USA.  Every nation that espoused that form of governance saw severe problems with it.  Prior to the Civil War, you had slavery.  The idea that slaves were property and subject to their owner's will and whim is very much a rightist concept.  Freeing slaves is very much a leftist concept."
"Freedom is subjective.  Liberty from all regardless of how a person seeks to control another, whether through exclusion from self sustenance or by threat of force, should be the stance of libertarians.  Taking a right or left approach means siding with democrats or republicans.  Currently I don't like the Republican party at all, but I'm not a Democrat.  Most libertarians are simply disgruntled republicans.  It appears you are as well."
Market economies aren't either right or left. 
Government managed markets are left wing ( authoritarian )
Free markets are right wing ( anti-authoritarian ) 
The empirical metric that defines the left and the right is the size of government with the far right being 0% government ( anarchism ) and the far left being 100% government (totalitarianism) with the center having a government with defined roles that it is ALLOWED to do and nothing else
"Free markets are government managed markets.  If the government doesn't manage the markets, then the mafia, cartel, gang, etc. do.  When the market is free, it is impossible for anyone to own it.  It takes government to eliminate the ability of people to control the market.  "
"If you want to see what non-government managed markets look like take a look at drug cartels, OPEC, pharmaceuticals, much of the third world, etc.  Every country with a strong economy is backed by a strong government that stops such things as piracy, theft, abuse of human rights, environmental protections, etc.  It takes government to keep people free from abuse of others.  Without government, you don't get your ""free market""."
The right isn't anarchic and the left isn't totalitarianism.  Those aren't at all how the right and left are defined in any way.  Your definitions are only in your head and wrong.
Free markets are government managed markets
Free markets are markets FREE from government meddling
"No, that's your definition.  A market may be controlled by any number of people.  Restricted != FREE.  It doesn't matter who restricts the market, if it is restricted it isn't free.  Without government protections, the markets tend towards subjugation to the most powerful player in the market.  History has shown this time and time again."
No thats is history's definition ...
"Ok, keep believing your thought exercises not corroborated through observation are somehow more correct than the observation of many throughout history.  You are a mighty one o master and what you say must be true.  (Bows down to the authority that hates authority)."
"I think, in general, you're probably right.  Though I disagree with the notion that changing from the inside will be successful even if more liberty minded people got elected.  The machine is too cumbersome to slow down, the answer is to step aside and allow it to collapse under its own weight."
"The machine is too cumbersome to slow down, the answer is to step aside and allow it to collapse under its own weight."
"You may be in a for a wait. Government is around 3000 years old. I'm guessing if it hasn't died yet, it isnt going to."
If you compare the amount of time big governments have existed to the amount of time they haven't they really haven't been a thing for all that long
Authoritarian Government has been a thing since Sumerian times. The fact they didnt return as much isnt exactly a selling point i hope.
Im not saying it hasnt existed for a long time im simply saying that there was a lot of time before sumerian times. In the grand scheme of things civilization and government are relatively new inventions.
"Government has always existed. Whether you call it a patriarch, a clan chief, a village strongman, warlord, etc."
Technically you are right but I think we can agree that a clan chief is a much different thing than the government of the USA or even the ancient governments of sumaria or rome.
"A clan chief was much more of a totalitarian dictator on a daily basis than an Emperor. Just because tyranny is local, doesn't make it better."
I didnt say it was better but it is for sure way different. Also its a lot easier to overthrow a clan chief than it is to overthrow an emperor
And the emperor has far less influence on your life than a tribal chief. You can talk smack about the king or the emperor every day without anyone caring but talk shit about the local noble and you will find yourself without a head in short order. 
Decentralization good is the usual mistake that libertarians make. I would take a centralized democracy over a decentralized tyranny any day of the week.
"Government has, this one has not.  And, to be frank, I don't care so much about the rest of you.  I'll step outside the system for myself and leave the rest of you to it."
So this one collapses and something else replaced. Heavy odds on something worse.
I fail to see how that's a perk.
I'll step outside the system for myself and leave the rest of you to it.
May I ask what this entails?
I agree I just included that part because I could tell that was going to be a somewhat common response
"Fair, and yes it often is."
Libertarians never win because libertarianism is unpopular with a majority of the American people. The libertarian economic model doesn't work in the real world.
Wouldn't the best libertarian essentially be someome who sabatoged government? Sounds like a fairly low qualification job.
The best libertarian politician might be someone who sabotages the government but I would argue the best libertarians would not want to work for the government at all even in order to sabotage it
"We are at loggerhead here. The best libertarian is the guy (or gal) who demolishs government. Being inept, incompetent and stupid achieves that just fine. "
What causes the hang up is the election. But libertarians are essentially at odds with democracy.
I disagree that the best libertarian is the person who demolishes government. Maybe that person is the best politician for libertarians but i don't think being a good libertarian is defined by how much of the government you destroy. I agree with the second part to an extent though democracy puts the will of the masses over the rights of the individual and libertarians put the rights of the individual over the will of the masses.
"Anarcho-capitalists who think it doesn't make sense for libertarians to establish and maintain a highly competent and efficient public government  which consistently and equally enforces individual rights aren't libertarians. Actual libertarians believe in individual rights to ownership of self and ownership of products of labor, and that a public government must be established and maintained in order to ensure that these rights are enforced equally, consistently, and impartially with respect to individuals."
You can believe that there should be a government without wanting to work in it
"The smartest most talented people don’t run for office at all. Megalomaniacs, and other power hungry fools run because they want attention and inflated self, but don’t sense the responsibility and consequence that scares off smart people."
It’s not a lib thing. It applies everywhere in the world.
"I mean, if you are Libertarian, you can see how changing government policy benefits you. No <em>poor</em> libertarian would ever run, since I dont see how you could take a salary, pension, or medical coverage and still be libertarian. But a successful libertarian would not be working for money."
There's a couple of things harming libertarianism.  Many are absolutists over pragmatists and would rather break than bend on their individual core libertarian issues.  The other thing is that the party is full of some pretty loony characters.  Its hard to take a party seriously if they have someone nominated for the party chair does a strip tease for the crowd.  Now I'm all for independent thought and the occasional strip tease... but Christ that was the most dumbshit political move I've ever seen.
I consider myself the best libertarian.  At least the best libertarian in this room.  Where I'm sitting  right now.  And I can tell you two things:
Why post-Kavanaugh?
"Look what the press did to him, and he's a certifiable boy scout!  Look what the press does to anyone who doesn't toe their line.  It makes a 4-chan attack look like a spring picnic!"
"So you’d replace a democratically elected government with a dictatorship, and get rid of  programs you don’t agree with even if they are popular, and throw workers in jail for organizing together for better work conditions and pay?   "
How does this forward liberty for anyone but yourself?
This forwards liberty for all.
"Smaller, leaner government means less spending,  so lower debt and less taxes.  Lower taxes puts more money in people's pockets.  Money is a facet of freedom."
"Workers can and should organize, for private companies.  But when you put yourself between citizens and their elected representatives,  you are in the way, and committing treason."
"I said, if given power.  I never said I would take power. I would use the power given to me to clean up a broken system."
Are you saying you relinquish your sovereign rights as a citizen?  Are you saying politicians know better than you how you should live your life? How you should spend your money?
Well I'm certainly not going to relinquish my sovereign rights to you.
Nor should you. Nor should anyone relinquish their rights to anyone.
"Yet, with every new law and every new tax, we do just that."
"So, the real question to ask with any law or tax is, is your loss of freedom that this will cause me worth whatever it will bring?"

Could be a smoke screen to mobilize towards Iran without raising alarm bells. False flag retaliation attack and presto U.S army is destroying Iranian culture faster than trump destroys the last bit of respect the world has for the U.S.
I’m expecting nothing and I still anticipate being disappointed.  Every time we’ve had any indication from this administration that they plan to draw back US involvement they end up doing the opposite.
Is this real though?  The letter isn't signed.
Reuters said they confirmed the letter with the Iraqi government.
There's already a ton of reports of crazy helicopter traffic near the green zone.
And..... now the government is denying it.
Okay.  They are probably going to used to attack Iran so I'm only cautiously hopeful.  I don't want a fucking Iranian war.

Party politics as usual.

Never. 
Never has a political party RAN on a platform of treason.
That killing was a mistake
"I have an outside perspective I’d like to share. I think the Libertarian Party’s “electability problem” is somewhat inevitable due the core tenants of the underlying ideology itself. Specifically, the tenant of (relatively) extreme individual freedom. An example of how this can bite the Party in the ass is when you have scantily clad men dance on stage at your convention, or when Johnson rode the unicycle all over. I think it can alienate some people who view the electoral process as a more “serious” one. "
"And I know that much of the “seriousness” of the Dems and Repubs is largely aesthetic, and I know there are many core Libertarian principles that many Americans would agree with, and would want reflected more in our system. But since your party is <em>so</em> devoted to individual freedom, it can allow “eccentric” people to be quite visible, and that can be a problem when you want to be viewed as a professional enterprise"
"I'm going to agree with you. Obviously, politics is a serious matter, and is not a place for vaudeville antics. How do you react to the childish behaviors of liberals like Alexandra Occasio Cortez, or the protestors who wear vagina hats? It seems their childish behaviors have become normalized and accepted by the media and the left."
"Well, the protestors aren’t associated as much (in any official sense) with the Dem Party because they aren’t wearing those hats on stage at the convention. If they are, I’d agree with you. Personally I do think the “pussy hats” are childish and counter productive, but it’s not like Dem Party officials are wearing them on stage. "
"As for AOC, I think she’s way overblown for a freshman rep, but as far as I’m aware,  she hasn’t done anything as goofy as riding a unicycle around, at least while in office"
"On this sub man, you just have guys living in their parents basements, concerned about intellectual purity. If even half of their posts were real, it wouldn't matter the name; they would still be unelectable because they have poor ideas and are easily derailed."
Libertarians decided democrats were their enemy and republicans were their friend.
Now democrats think Libertarians are republican rejects
Libertarians will never win under the libertarian flag.
"What were your ideas. I feel like a person like Larry Sharpe could win an election if he wasnt ""branded"" libertarian but ran on the exact same principles. I feel like the media does us a disservice and that's about it."
Its way more then the media.
"I feel the biggest issue is that Libertarian party platform (and the general philosophy) is a major hindrance in a democracy. When your platform empowers the few over the many, you struggle in democracy. You also cant swing your weight to social issues because libertarian social policy isnt strong enough to overcome the economic issues failures."
"That's ignoring that many libertarians put economic first, and willingly thrust a tonto into the social platform for small wins (if we can call it that) in economic. Moreover tax cuts without spending cuts tend to be just fine for many of the above economic firsts."
"All the media would get you, is more of the typical insanity and fakes that the party/platforms known for."

Did you read the platform from the last election?  You don't make much sense with your criticisms. 
Can you point out specific language in the platform that talks about empowering the few over the many? Or where in the platform it says economic issues are prioritized over others? 
Here is link to the platform.  Waiting for your reply.
"<a href=""https://www.lp.org/platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lp.org/platform/</a>"
Did you read the platform from the last election
"Does the platform promise to use government to protect the poor from landlords, business owners, and employers? If not, then that's my first paragraph. "
"Does it sound like the socially conservative Republicans platform socially? If not, that is my second paragraph."
Libertarian policy runs afoul of the same issues that classic liberalism did. It is a great boon to the wealthy who can use their wealth to level or enhance their side of the table at a negotiation. This runs afoul of the poor significantly because they are inherently at a disadvantage.
Can you point out specific language in the platform that talks about empowering the few over the many?
"Yes, skimming through, these immediately are what I mean:"
2.1 Property and Contract
2.6 Government Employees
2.11 Labor Markets
I think the libertarians should engage a professional marketing company to assist them in rebranding.
The main problem is that US election system is 100% rigged for two parties.  
"So, it is at the moment a waste of time to even think about winning elections other than local ones until the election system is changed."
"Right now, all efforts should first be spent on trying to change the US election system and get measures such as runoffs, ranked choice voting, etc, to be implemented.   After that is accomplished, then someone other than the two parties can even have a chance and you will probably see a number of 3rd parties participate in the US political system, and I am also guessing you might see a large increase in the number of people that vote because they can find a voice that is not limited to the two main parties."
"One of the two major parties supports this. Guess which party the majority of libertarians vote for, though?"
A good point.
"I see a lot of right leaning conservative libertarians hating on the LP. I think anyone who says it is not libertarian enough, libertarian is a philosophy is really just a weed republican. Many like the idea of low taxes and guns but past that they love the authoritarian ideas of modern conservatives who want to legislate morality. "
Abortion is a great example.
"Ideological absolutists don't win elections. Ultimately, the lose because they never really influence policy."
"Libertarians really can’t win an election as libertarians. Because if there’s one thing both parties love working together to do, it’s changing the rules in order to protect their duopoly. I think we’re better off trying to change one of the major parties to become more libertarian"
There's no way to change the existing parties. They are too entrenched and have too much money.
"I don’t know, the republicans are starting to get more tolerant of social liberalism. Also, the west seems to be getting tired of the left. I don’t think it’s unlikely that the Democrats will have to restructure their political beliefs in the coming years in order to stay relevant. So basically I think Libertarians should join the Republican Party and wait for the Democrat Party to collapse then hit them with everything we’ve got to turn them into libertarians."
"Libertarians cannot win elections because they have very little to offer.  They claim that they are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Yet, social liberty is impossible under the libertarian ideal of economic freedom."
"Libertarian's ideal society would be the one with little to no taxation and everything privatized. Now, call me crazy but if I am an average person, this gives me very little actual freedom. I am just left at the mercy of the upper class and whatever scraps it throws my way to prevent me from outright revolting and killing them."
"Another leftist reveals itself <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>^</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> on <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a>"
"You're aware that right libertarianism is not the only kind, yes?"
"Most people on the right are statists.  On the left, commies.  None of those are libertarian"
Is it required for libertarians to state the obvious as if it is some great revelation?
"Would you like it if they because the party of economic opportunity? Say, instead of spending trillions of war, some of those dollars go to middle class and lower income folks to provide financial opportunity?"
Except you would need to do things that would make most libertarians' heads explode. 
"Do you think that we spend trillions on military just because? Nope, there are good and bad reasons for it. "
"Our military spending buys the preferential trade deals, safe sea routes and a more disarmed world that makes it easier for us to flex our diplomatic muscles across the world. These are the good reason for high military spending."
Bad reasons:
"We also have an allergy towards welfare, so we need to come up with tricks to provide people with welfare without actually calling it welfare. Military is the greatest example of that. And as long as we have states, and as long as small and poor states have the senate, military spending will never be cut. There are states where military account for like 10-20% of all jobs. Cutting military would kill the economies of these states and any representative who lets it happen will never be reelected."
But libertarians would go nuts if we were to take away power from these smaller states and centralize it into the federal government. 
They would also go nuts if we were to stop with euphemisms and just give people free housing and food for work that we do not really need. 
You want less military spending? Then say hello to less trade and more welfare. 
"Now, many libertarians will say: ""we do not need welfare, people will take care of each other as long as we get government out of the way and let people keep more of their money via lower taxation"". Of course, history shows that statement to be full of shit. You can add several zeroes to my salary and I would give exactly zero dollars to some random strangers and most of my family. Not to mention that most charities are just wasting their money or scams. "
"They will also say: ""Let each country handle the protection of its trade"". History also shows what happens when multiple superpowers compete for the control of the trade routes. Massive bloodshed, waste and inefficiency. "
"We are living in a complex world with complex problems that require complex, imperfect and downright shitty solutions. Libertarians refuse to accept that reality and it hurts them."
Edit:
And of course I forgot about the military industrial complex. That will never go away until we castrate the power of corporations. That is also not something most libertarians are willing to do. 
"After all, ""it is insane to think that to solve the problems created by the state we would need to expand the state"". Except many ""state"" problems are actually ""us"" problems that the state has been trying to work around."
You make many good points. One issue that I have concern is that libertarians have not addressed the robotics/automation situation. Low skilled labor cannot complete in this environment. Have you considered the economic impact of this?
I have and it is not fun. What we have faced in the past few hundred years was mechanization. Where a single worker could do the work of a hundred workers. But that simply meant that our productivity increased and jobs were still there. The 99 farmers would just move to the city and use the product of the labor of 1 farmer to make new shit.
"Now, we have the situation where people are being replaced. Even in things that we think of as ""high skilled labor"" like medicine. Just recently I read an article about AI being better at analyzing CT scans. I also remember more than 10 years ago reading about how AI is better at reading EKGs."
"Lawyers are getting replaced by AIs, not the top ones of course but the paralegals who would eventually become lawyers are out of a job."
Here is another scary statistic:
Despite the fact that the population of USA has grown AND productivity has increased. The amount of labor hours has not actually changed significantly. 
More people are competing for fewer jobs.
We have two paths in my dumb little mind:
"Significant population controls and almost a post scarcity utopia for the smaller population dedicated to research, art etc. and the little maintenance that the machines making it happen need. "
We keep pretending that new jobs will appear as people make less and less and eventually tear each other apart competing for the last dollar.
"Actually, I agree. So long as we continue on the current economic model, technology will make workers obsolete. Plus, international labor often works 12-14 hour days at a fraction of the cost, and their industries are best labeled State capitalism. "
"We don't live in a democracy or a republic. We live in an economic empire with a facade of liberty and representative government. It's unrealistic to assume the government will place the interests of the citizens over the interests of the mega-rich. I find in practice libertarian philosophy falls short because it assumes market driven corrections of corrupt political economies will take place. Historically, these corrections are called revolutions, and frequently make matters worse of the citizens. Were I see intelligence in the libertarian thinking is they understand the corruption inherent in large government. Unfortunately, I think they discount it in large business somewhat, and their enforcement strategies look questionable. Do you agree?"
"I agree, i just wish to add that corruption is inherent to every large organization (another point that libertarians miss, they think that corporations are less inefficient and corrupt than government, HA) but large organizations have access to tools that make that corruption worth it. "
"Our government is very much a democracy. However, too many people in USA are convinced that they are much richer than they actually are, which makes it easy to get them to vote for policies that hurt them. "
"I have lost track of how many times I have heard the phrase: ""my family was lower middle class, we used food stamps only once in a while"". Dude, if you used food stamps ever, then your family was poor not anywhere close to middle class. A lawyer or doctor who is just starting out is lower middle class. "
"I also remember how happy people were when inheritance tax was reduced, despite the fact that it does not kick in until you inherit more than 11 mln dollars. How many americans have that much coming in from their parents?"
"Remember Libertarians are a ""personal responsibility"" party. The 10% Far right and 10% far left have left the 80% of middle america out. Most americans are ignorant and just go through the motions of life. Only 26% of americans can name the 3 branches of government."
"Unfortunately, true."
"Ah, the hubris of this statement. Ironic, for a philosophy that relies so heavily on the market, that the reflexive thing to do is blame the consumers (voters) rather than the seller (the libertarian community) for a lack of sales."
You cant. Libertarians are cucks. China owns you now.
Even if this is passed in the House will the Senate even debate it much less vote on it?
"What is this even going to accomplish?  Trump knows he can break any law and get away with it, so he will just ignore it.  They would be better off if they simply refused to approve of any budget that includes funding for the executive branch.  They must shut the whole thing down at all costs."
Congress should declare war.
"No, they should not."
"Sorry, Congress should have the power to declare war, not the president."
Agreed. And they should not declare war on Iran and should terminate the AUMF against terrorism and bring our troops home.
"At its most basic, libertarianism is looking for the most personal freedom while still keeping order with the smallest government possible. "
"You will not find consensus on many issues, other than generalities like your rights end where mine begin. "
You’ll find a large percentage of libertarians are against laws with victimless crimes; drugs or prostitution for example. 
"We support freedom of speech, but require you to be responsible for what you say. "
"When it comes to war, we generally believe it’s only acceptable as a direct protection of the country. "
"On taxes, we do believe they should be minimal, which could include zero taxes. We generally believe that taxes should be applied equally through something like a flat tax."
"On taxes, we do believe they should be minimal, which could include zero taxes"
"That is not the consistent libertarian position on taxes. The consistent libertarian position on taxes is that earned income acquired by production and voluntary exchange should be taxed at 0%, but that unearned income acquired by claiming privileges which allow the private seizure of products of others should be taxed at 100%."
We generally believe that taxes should be applied equally through something like a flat tax
"Certainly not. A flat revenue or receipts tax on the voluntary exchange of tangible products would be disastrous, and fall heavily on earned income, and unearned income not at all. A flat tax on accounting profits or net-income which preserved writeoffs and deductions for necessary &amp; tangible expenses for households and businesses would be better, but still fall heavily on earned income rather than unearned income. To the extent that a net-income \ accounting-profits tax falls more heavily on unearned income than earned income as taxable income increases, imposing it at graduated rates is preferable to imposing it at flat rates."
"A flat tax would only be just if it was applied exclusively and directly to source of unearned income, such as a tax on the appraised price of patents which allows the rich to privately extract unearned income by removing land and ideas from the commons and unjustly charge other residents for access to the public domain."
"Can you provide examples of what you consider ""unearned"" income?"
In a nutshell it emphasizes personal freedom. The idea is that as long as you aren't hurting anyone else you should be able to do what you want.
There is a lot of info out there if you really want to dig in. If you would rather watch videos instead of read you can check out reason TV on YouTube. Their videos generally have a very libertarian point of view.

"It’s important to know that there are many different kinds of libertarianism, with lots of fundamental disagreements between them. "
(And just so we’re clear my biases will be on display here). 
"Originally, “libertarian” was just a word applied to people struggling for their own freedom in some way. The first time it was used by a group to describe their distinct political beliefs was in 1850s France, by anarcho-communists like Joseph Déjacque and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. The idea was that capitalism was inherently hierarchical, and that if truly left to their own devices a community would probably decide upon some form of socialism—but not in the sense that an all-powerful state apparatus would run everything. "
"It wasn’t until a century later in the 1950s that Americans began using “libertarianism” to describe an adherence to laissez-faire capitalism and a belief in minimal state intervention in general. The phrase “socially liberal but fiscally conservative” has become a cliché, but in my observation “fiscal conservatism” actually does a lot to maintain outdated social hierarchies and many self-described libertarians also hold what I would call socially conservative beliefs (Hans-Hermann Hope being a notable example). "
"Nowadays, there are things self-described left-libertarians and right-libertarians often largely agree on (anti-interventionism and freedom of speech, for one) and things they often vehemently disagree on (usually anything to do with economics)."
"Libertarianism is ethical belief in self-ownership and ownership of products of labor. You have an individual right to exclusive use of your body and the tangible products resulting from the combination of your labor with land (wealth) provided you reciprocate the same right to others. Politically, libertarianism is belief that individual rights which can be mutually reciprocated should be consistently and equally enforced, and that doing so will maximize freedom."
"In order to consistently enforce individual rights according to these ideals, residents must establish public control of land and law by organizing a publicly controlled government (republic), which has the power to levy fines on any parties which violate the individual rights of residents, and levy fees on any parties claiming exclusive use of a portion of the public domain, as claims to exclusive use of land and ideas are coercively enforced priviliges which allow the holder to extract the products of labor of others, as such claims are not claims to excludable products of labor and cannot be mutually reciprocated nor equally enforced."
The consistent libertarian position on taxes is that earned income should be taxed at 0% and unearned income should be taxed at 100%. The consistent libertarian position on war is that they are only just if they are defensive and fought for purposes of maintaining public control of land and law to prevent them from falling under the control of private parties which have no interest in equally enforcing individual rights of residents.
Fox news is state run propaganda.
All news paper and TV show news agencies are just propaganda paid for by backers from both sides.
I've given clear evidence of fox news being state propaganda yet you hand wave and say both sides.
Anderson Cooper is literally CIA so yes both sides.
Anderson Cooper was a back channel to Obama through Eric Holder?
"News has three sources, anything less is hearsay and op-ed, has Hannity confirmed any of this, anyone else other than the guy already neckdeep in shit? It has some ring of truth but lacks evidence to be a legal claim until there is corroborated evidence."
"And yes both sides skirt the legal edges and likely step over the line daily, what do you propose to fix this lack of accountability in speaking of truths and acting in good faith?"
"Socialists don't matter.  You never have, and you never will you pathetic piece of subhuman garbage."
You support a president that's using socialist policies to pay farmers. If anyone is a socialist here it's you.
You support a president that's using socialist policies to pay farmers.
"I don't support Presidents, period.  I support the policies they enact if they're good policies, and oppose them if they're bad policies."
I opposed Trump's tarriffs and farmer payouts because they're bad policies.
"So you're wrong, and also a moron."
Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays...
Really weird how this guy has to announce how much he hates communists every time he walks into a room
"Aww look, it still thinks it's people.  How cute."
Your hatred of your fellow man merely for differences in political opinion is disgusting.
"You know, it's funny."
"When I call Nazis garbage and tell them they don't matter, no one has a problem."
"But as soon as I start telling socialists and communists that, people like you suddenly get all uppity."
"Why do you think that is?  I mean, I <em>know</em> why that is, I just want to see if you do."
Are you OK
Are you under the impression that you matter?
Lol JFC man. Take a break from politics.
"You know, just <em>maybe</em>, it’s because people like you call everyone slightly left of your own ignorant views a communist? "
Conservative politicians have been branding <em>every</em> liberal and Democrat a <em>socialist</em> for as long as I can remember. It’s like the boy who cried wolf. It’s turned the entire Fox News group into rapidly hateful ideologues who oppose anyone viewed as “other.”
"Then on the flip side, you have entire generations of liberals being told by those same hateful conservatives that they’re socialist, and you know what, maybe they are and that’s okay because every other liberal is called a socialist too, right? Instead of reasonably speaking with liberals and trying to sway their opinion, they’ve only belittled them and attacked them."
"In that regard, conservatives have no one but themselves to blame for the growing support of these ideals and programs that they brand <em>socialist.</em> You’ve made your bed, now lay in it."
Conservative politicians have been branding every liberal and Democrat a socialist for as long as I can remember. 
And?
You just literally described how the Democrats treat everyone to the right of Joseph fucking Stalin.
"Oh, and lest we forget, one of the most prominent Democrats running for President is an open and avowed socialist."
"But let me guess, tankie--that's not ""real"" socialism, right?"

You mean exactly like the left is doing to the right?
"In that regard, conservatives have no one but themselves to blame for the growing support of these ideals and programs that they brand socialist."
The lack of self-awareness here is staggering.
"There is never a good reason to be a Nazi, just like there is never a good reason to be a socialist.  If someone becomes a Nazi because the left was mean to them, they are worthless.  Just the same, if you become a socialist/communist because the right was mean to you, you are worthless."
You think you're any different to the fucking Neo-Nazis?  You're not.  Your ideology has murdered even more people than theirs.
"You all are so quick to say things like ""Nazi lives don't matter,"" and I agree with you on that part.  I just want to make sure you understand you're worth exactly as little as they are."
Scum.
You need a Snickers bar
"so are you saying that people of England, France, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy and other countries are the scum/worthless and deserve death?"

Just because you want to hurt people who disagree with you doesn't mean the rest of us do.  That's one of the reasons you'll always be worthless.

"But let me guess, tankie--that's not ""real"" socialism, right?"
Right. One of those egregious points that most conservatives <em>knowingly make</em> is the conflation of <em>Democratic Socialism</em> and <em>Social Democrats.</em> Beyond that is the difference between Democratic Socialism and plain Socialism.
"Nearly all of the policies advocated by liberal American Democrats are <em>Social Democratic policies,</em> similar policies in basically every European country in one way or another."
"Don’t ask me why, because I don’t have the answer, but for whatever reason American Social Democrats call themselves Democratic Socialists. Another great example of this that all Libertarians can relate to all too well is what Americans call <em>Libertarianism</em> is called <em>Liberalism</em> by the majority of the world. And of course, another good example is how many other countries use the color red for liberal parties and blue for conservative parties. "
You think you're any different to the fucking Neo-Nazis?  You're not.  Your ideology has murdered even more people than theirs.
Thank you for illustrating my point regarding how conservatives call everyone they disagree with a socialist. I’m not a socialist. I’m not a communist. I’m a left-learning libertarian.
Scum.
"You’re hatred for your fellow man must be very exhausting as you’re perpetual angst against <em>the other</em> seemingly overwhelms you on a daily basis.

Right.

"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism"" rel=""nofollow"">Marxism</a> involves socioeconomic analysis and is a concept that has no single definitive theory due to various schools of thought that have branched our from it. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism"" rel=""nofollow"">Socialism</a> developed well before Marxism came about. There are schools of thought derived from Marxism that <em>do</em> use Socialism. This is what we’ve come to know as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"" rel=""nofollow"">Communism</a>."
"In Western Europe, another school of though derived from Socialism developed into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy"" rel=""nofollow"">Social Democracy</a>. This is the derivative that nearly all European policies are based on that Americans label as “Socialist.” "
"Do you think I give a fuck about the differences between ""Nazism"" and ""Democratic Nazism""?  Or ""Nazism"" and ""Nazi Democracy""?"
"Fascism is defined as being an authoritarian state, so it is not possible to have a “Nazi Democracy” as you put it. However, yes you should certainly “give a fuck” about the differences between your examples. Words have meaning. A “Democratic X” is different than plain “X” which is also different than “X Democracy.” I can’t help you though if you aren’t bothered to educate yourself."
It doesn't matter what prefix you put in front of your garbage ideology--it's still garbage.
"It’s not simply a prefix or suffix. It’s a modifier that changes the entire meaning of the phrase. This goes back to educating yourself. For example, a Republic is vastly different that a Democratic Republic. One is an oligarchy and the other is a democracy. "
"Oh yes, the rest of the world is so ""libertarian."""
That’s not what I said. The word “Libertarian” is near exclusively used in the United States and it is synonymous with the rest of the world’s view of “Liberalism.”
"In the US, this is known as Classical Liberalism."
"Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support limited government, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), capitalism (free markets), democracy, secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion."
Yellow is the political colour most commonly associated with liberalism.
Sound familiar? 
"Consequently, in the United States the ideas of individualism and laissez-faire economics previously associated with classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of libertarian thought."
Libertarian = Liberal for a good chunk of the world. My point was to highlight the fact that Americans tend to call things by the incorrect words.
"American Democratic Socialism = European Social Democracy. You know, because Americans like being different it seems."
"Tell me, how are their gun rights?"
"Gun rights are not the defining topic for Libertarians or Liberals. On the contrary, most countries <em>can’t even comprehend</em> American gun rights because most other nations don’t have a gun culture and firearm protections have <em>never</em> existed. It’s entirely like comparing apples to oranges. "
That doesn’t change the fact that most European Liberals would be Libertarians if they moved to the US. They might even be Republican! 
"Regardless, I hope you try to not be so close-minded in the future. You are woefully uneducated when it comes to nuances in political theory."
"Fascism is defined as being an authoritarian state, so it is not possible to have a “Nazi Democracy” as you put it."
"Lol, still trying to pretend like you're any different."
"Socialism is also authoritarian, dumbass."
Holy shit you're historically illiterate.
Words have meaning. A “Democratic X” is different than plain “X” which is also different than “X Democracy.” 
Not for Nazis.  You exclude them from that distinction.
"Why do you think you matter any more than they do?  Because you don't, and never will you socialist scum."
It’s not simply a prefix or suffix. It’s a modifier that changes the entire meaning of the phrase.
Democratic Nazism is still Nazism.
Democratic Socialism is still Socialism.
Democratic Theft is still theft.
"It doesn't matter if you &amp; a bunch of your worthless tankie friends all vote to take my money--that's still authoritarianism, and it's still theft."
Holy shit you tankie are fucking retarded trash.
The word “Libertarian” is near exclusively used in the United States and it is synonymous with the rest of the world’s view of “Liberalism.”
More lies.
"Gun rights are not the defining topic for Libertarians or Liberals. On the contrary, most countries can’t even comprehend American gun rights because most other nations don’t have a gun culture and firearm protections have never existed."
So they have no gun rights.
So they're not libertarian.
"Thanks for playing, tankie.  Know that you're not a libertarian, you never will be, and you and all your socialist friends are statist trash."
Have a shit day.
"Well, if you can't have Trumps backchannel Hannitys is probably similar."
Iran deal fucked.
Escalations on both sides.
An act of war.
"We are either much much closer to war, or at war and just not fully aware of it."
The fact your asking this question should give you the answer. 
No one was talking about an Iranian conflict in 2016.
Trump didn't take office in 2016.
That's probably why no one was talking about war with iran
No difference
Yeah seriously. We aren't going to war with Iran.
The goal was to make the media forget about Impeachment and oh boy did it work.
"Impeachment news fell when impeachment process stalled. This may have helped but there wasn't anything new to report on impeachment since..shit a month ago almost? Not till todays announcement on Bolton, which is news but just one thing. Iraq is a full swarm of news."
"It'll pick up again when the Senate kicks off its hearings, or whatever they end up doing."
"Two of the five top stories in my Google news feed right now are about impeachment and the Iran news isn't good for Trump in any discernable way.  On top of that, the 'side' pushing the prospect of war with Iran is the same 'side' that impeached Trump so for this conspiracy theory to be accurate you would have to argue that the people who impeached Trump are the same people trying to get the media to forget about it.  "
The 'distraction' conspiracy theory almost never makes any logical sense when thrown out in these types of comments.
No it wasn’t smh. Impeachment is a joke. Nancy can’t even turn over the articles lmaoooo
Now.
Pretty fucking obvious. I question your intent in asking this
"Rural republicans have always been the #1 welfare dependents in the country, so this isn't too surprising."
aka buying votes.
Probably the reason we only have 2 parties. Both buy votes
Glad im not the only one who sees it.
Damn socialists always trying to buy votes. Good thing we vote for Trump who isn't some socialist.
Don’t feed the wild animals. They will become dependent.
Giving subsidies to farmers is such a new terrible thing. Good thing the woke crowd got onto this one early enough before the American farmer got dependent upon subsidy.
Guys we need to subsidize education and healthcare
Wtf food lmao no that's gay
I looked and this is the best I could find. I'll continue to look though.

The hell? I basically lived in Teton Village when this guy was running last time. It’s in Jackson Hole. Had no idea he was based out of there.
Huh. The things that happen in your own back yard.
"Is this the guy who ran in 2016, not as a libertarian?"
Yes.
"I was living in the town that he’s now based out of, not sure if he was at the time. I was working on a ranch surrounded by super libertarians, and I never even heard him mentioned. Wonder if he wasn’t based out of there at the time or if his political leanings have changed?"
"If you received more public services than you paid taxes for, someone else paid more taxes than they received services. "
The idea that you get more than you otherwise would pay with taxes just means you want others to keep subsidizing you.
"more public services than you paid taxes for, someone else paid more taxes than they received services."
"Insurance works similarly, only government tends to actually hold their end of a bargain."
"Also, "
someone else paid more taxes than they received services.
"Not an argument. It's balanced by me, in part, paying for the services that I don't (immediately) use, but they do."
"In other words, instead of making me pay, let's say, 400$ bucks to ride to the hospital, I pay about 3-4 bucks a month out of  what I pay via taxes.
Which absolves me from a burden of setting up GoFundMe and go begging others for spare change if something unfortunate happens to me."
"And in the end, instead of being bankrupt, I can just keep paying my taxes and, retrospectively, pay for the services I might us. Which is pretty much like insurance, but without a death board that would try to screw me out from service I've paid by finding some technicality that would justify them scamming me out."
"Also, you haven't answered the question in title. I've listed my incentives for paying the taxes, why the hell should I prefer relying on private charity rather than on system that actually works?"
The difference between taxes and insurance is that you don’t get put into a rape cage for not paying for insurance. 
I donate because there are organizations that do a better job creating solutions to medical conditions and social issues than I do alone. And that makes me feel good.
"Also, if you received more public services than you paid for, someone paid for those services. Someone has paid for more services than they’ve used and thus subsidized you."
Taxation is the forced redistribution of private property. Private charity is voluntary. Incentive is irrelevant.
Your argument dismisses morality. It’s like saying there is no incentive to court a woman when you can rape her.
Taxation is the forced redistribution of private property. Private charity is voluntary. Incentive is irrelevant.
"Sorry, but I'm more of the ""facts before feelings"" kind of guy. Between my neighborhood not having youth gangs before I pay taxes to ensure that youth has somewhat marketable education and feefees of some millionaire that considers me, in best case, a fucking cattle, I'll choose the former."
"Because butthurt of the rich or libertarians is not palpable to me.
A knife in my gut or a bat cracking my skull, on the other hand, is really fucking palpable."
Your argument dismisses morality.
"I am arguing from ""Facts before feelings."" position."
It’s like saying there is no incentive to court a woman when you can rape her.
"a) Courting a woman usually ends up in better quality of sex (and repeated sex also)<br/>
b) Courting a woman usually solves the whole range of the ""finding a woman"" problem, private charity doesn't solve a problem at all, only dealing (half-assedly) with individual or small-scaled cases.<br/>
c) Most of the lolberts here would claim the rape as ""voluntary"" if I pay her some money afterwards and she takes it (aka doing a Weinstein on her). Trying to pull in ""morality"" argument with an example of rape is laughable."

"Private charity gives you the freedom to choose to help or not, and the freedom to direct it where you would like to make an impact. Taxation does not allow this. "
"The question is then which makes to greater impact for your dollar on social welfare. Taxation is seen as inefficient, but may help create better stability in the area it operates due to constancy in both funding and direction. For example food stamp programs create stable markets that firms can then operate in. Government programs can tackle multi side issues on a large scale. 
Private charities  are seen as more efficient, but can be ad hoc and piecemeal in how they operate. EG they may address short term hunger extremely well, but may not be able to address the underlying issues such as lack of jobs. They may also be more localized or favor certain groups over others. Eg church charities."
"Private charity gives you the freedom to choose to help or not,"
"And I choose to not help anyone. As most of the people will. Not my business.<br/>
What are the incentives specifically to CHANGE that line of thought in order to make charities, well, <em>work</em>?"
and the freedom to direct it where you would like to make an impact.
"False, I can't track and influence the flow of money within charity organisation."
"Private charities are seen as more efficient,"
"Mostly by people that haven't worked in said charities.Interior bureacracy is as convoluted and inefficient in private entities as it's in government.
Imo, a private charity is akin to sticking your fingers into leaking dam instead of just coming in together and pay money to build a new one."
"While the former has ""the liberty"" point you pointed out in the beginning of the comment, it will do jackshit when said dam collapses, while the other will deal with the problem more-less effectively, while trampling on the freedoms of few idiots who think that they are smart shit and nothing bad will happen to them."
"In fact, dealing with such people is main reason, why I don't buy the whole ""private charity will deal with problems better than the government"". It won't. Because while you waste time explaining things out of his comfort zone to every idiot individually (and providing good fucking arguments that could trample the ""Me have more money if don't give"" argument), the probem not only won't go away, but actually become worse."
"Of course, by THAT point the non-paying individualls wil ""wake up"", like that cunt who didn't pay it's fire department's fee and then cried when firefighters watch her home burn to crisp, but the problem in question either will not be salvageable, or will demand an increased input of time and resources."
"“And I choose to not help anyone. As most of the people will. Not my business.
What are the incentives specifically to CHANGE that line of thought in order to make charities, well, work?”"
Which is why taxes are used by most governments to provide welfare to people in need instead of relying on charity.
"You are looking for incentives to change your line of thought? SERIOUSLY?Assisting others less fortunate than you/ charity is about GIVING, not trying to make out what is best for you. try having some empathy ffs."
"So, no argument instead of appealing to feefees. And no substance instead of half-assed attempt at insult and ""YoU aRe NoT bEiNg EmPaThEtIc"". And these people take pride in ""facts and logic"", lol. I am arguing from rational self-interest. And from the rational self interest, ""THE CHARITY IS ABOUT GIVING"" argument is a moral mumbo-jumbo and leftist feefees bullshit. Are you a fucking commie, mate?"
Which is why taxes are used by most governments to provide welfare to people in need instead of relying on charity.
"I am specifically addressing the point most conservatives and libertarians/ancaps tend to make that private charity will be enough and we don't need welfare. I've made this thread specifically to see arguments for the opposite that you have quote. Preferrably the ones that don't involve nagging and shaming about ""giving"". Because we all know how this shit generally works on a general population (newsflash, it doesn't)"
"What is your point? You asked about how libertarians saw charity vs taxes to help the disadvantaged. I gave a view on how some see the effectiveness of each.  I did not argue for either. You have made no argument against either apart from ‘I’m not wasting my money’ which you are welcome to do. The definition of charity is  the voluntary giving of help, typically in the form of money, to those in need. All you have done is argue with yourself as I’m not trying to convince you. Calling people in need of charity ‘druggies and hobos’ is lacking empathy and is not directed as an insult. I think calling me a ‘commie’ and your use of all caps and mixed caps was an attempt from you tho. 
If you have serious (as stated in your original post) comment please make it without the juvenile trolling and I’d be happy to reply."
"Why are you using the word “should”? There is no “should” in this scenario, people can do it or not do it, as they please."
"When people don't have argumentation, they like to police wording.
Have anything to say on the question in title? No? Then fuck off."
"The question assumes the libertarian argument of ""Private charity is more effective than government tax-funded problems"" and, generally, private charity as viable alternative to said programs, which assumes some amount of people (&gt;0) paying up. You getting triggered on the word ""should"" means jackshit for the discussion."
"Ha! Geez, someone’s touchy about being made to look like an idiot, huh? Look champ, if you’re trying to find reasons why other people “should” do things, you don’t understand how libertarianism works. "
Now fuck off back to mommy. Don’t blame other people for your inability to word your own question correctly.
"Look champ, if you’re trying to find reasons why other people “should” do things, you don’t understand how libertarianism works."
"I understand how libertarianism works.
Made up some bullshit that private charity is better than government and then catch on to words when you are getting asked why exactly it's better than government and why everyone should support the system."
"Also, I specifically mentioned ""should"" instead of ""must"". Is knowing english language a fucking socialism too among tards like you?"
"It is a shame you didn’t answer his question though. As someone interested to know the answer, whether people ‘should’ do something or not doesn’t really fall on my radar."
"someone’s touchy about being made to look like an idiot, huh?"

"Mutual aid, on the other hand, did not carry the same stigma. It was based on reciprocity: today's mutual-aid recipient could be tomorrow's donor, and vice versa."
"In other words, relying on some unlikely scenario (since we are not in 19-th century England/USA and certainly not in serfdom Russian empire, where this shit was working) of ""karmic retribution"" that people who don't even know me might help me just because I am acting good."

It's not even basic economics or psychology - it's basic <em>maths</em>."
"It’s wild that the only time that you pay for things that you want/need, is when it’s done under the implied threat of violence. I’m a grown up. I understand that things cost me money."
Being a decent person who wants to help others is usually a good reason.
Half the libers here would co sider even that communism though.

Virtue signalling is essentially synonymous with socialism to redcaps
That’s not what that post says..... 🤷🏻‍♀️
It shows the kind of antagonistic thinking I was talking about 🤷
"I made no reference to “antagonistic thinking”, that’s just ppl disagreeing with you. What I said was that <em>nobody</em> thinks charity=communism."
I made no reference to “antagonistic thinking”
My comment was about antagonistic thinking...
"I know you're realllllllllyyyy hung up on taking the word communism literally, but cmon"
"No, it wasn’t. You made the claim that many libertarians charity=communism, I just pointed out that’s bullshit. If you don’t like being called on your bullshit then don’t post bullshit."
Look at you doubling down over nothing.
"You can use as many childish insults as you like, it’s still a fact that nobody thinks charity=communism. You’re full of shit."
Being a decent person who wants to help others is usually a good reason.
"So, feefees and virtue-signaling instead of actually solving problems. Ok."
Why are you describing your own comment to me?
"Some people dont like to see other ""suffer"". Their natural self interest is to donate so they dont ""suffer"" from seeing other people ""suffer"""
"if the taxpaid government program does better job on dealing with junkies and hobos in my neighbourhood (about 100-200 of them, if not more) than I could ever with my personal money via charity (realistically, helping about 2 guys if I donate ALL of my salary), why should I choose the charity over taxes?"
because the charity doesnt take your money at gunpoint. Why cant the government employees who deal so good with junkies create a private charity?
Why cant the government employees who deal so good with junkies create a private charity?
Because private charity can't do jackshit and taxation is more effective at gathering resources and coverage specifically because of not wasting time to convince every retard to escape his comfort zone?
I don't need some good samaritans helping two or three junkies and then patting themselves on the back for it.
I want. My whole. Neighbourhood. Fucking clean.
I want. My whole. Neighbourhood. Fucking clean. 
​
Property rigths would allow to physically remove junkies.
Well sure but then they would come right back because the only place they can go is onto someone else’s property who will do the same.  And you end up spending your resources on a revolving door rather than solving your problem.
So there I was

And I stumble on another wiseyoungman post
Is it possible it's from the commercial spammer who openly states he uses Reddit for advertising his sites and selling Trump memorabilia?
Wiseyoungman.com is fake news
The Senate GOP won't call him.
"Perhaps, but this does move the needle."
"Announcing his willingness to testify is clearly poking the eye of GOP Senators. While Mitch wants to protect Trump, his overriding concern is protecting the GOP Senators.  Incidents like these could start shifting his calculus, fearing the later testimony of Bolton and others could make them look foolish and lose votes."
literally nothing will come from this. he called the Majority Leader first.
"Do you think Mitch McConnell was happy to receive this call?  If Bolton wanted to coordinate with the White House the same as Mitch McConnell, this announcement wouldn't have been made. "
"Maybe nothing happens, but Bolton called an audible that isn't in the White House or GOP Senate playbook.  Pressure to call him can only increase now, on both sides of the aisle."
lmao football words
Noted beacon of liberty Saudi Arabia.
Should America avoid diplomacy with all Muslim theocracies?
Of course not.  We should absolutely be having good productive meetings with Iran.
Have you ever thought LOGICALLY about how that might impact our relations with SA?
Yup.
Maybe if we were friends with Iran then they would let us know when SA would fly planes into our buildings.

Get out of here douchebag
"I welcome him to the party. And I hope he spends sometime learning. However, I would never vote for him to be our nomine."
I welcome him to the party.
Why?  He is a socialist using us for 50-state ballot access.

You can read his voting record.  Start with his support for single payer (socialized) medicine.

Meh...
"We can, have and will in the future do a lot worse. "
"We could do a lot better, tho."
"Vote for me, I'll do absolute nothing except get blackout drunk on your tax dollars and be an embarrassing failure on the international circuit"
"In terms of policy, he seems like your average moderate Democrat. But he has extremely solid experience, and seems like he is someone who could give the Libertarian Party a needed push. Very interested to see how he does and how his campaign turns out."
"I'm all for someone with experience, but not when their record is as horrible as Chafee's is. He voted for the Patriot Act and then he voted to reauthorize it. He voted to make it easier for the government to tap your cellhpone. He voted for tax increases. As Governor of Rhode Island he raised taxes and spending, that's why a libertarian think tank graded his performance a ""D"". And he's a big supporter of gun control."
"I get wanting experience, but the representative of the Libertarian Party should be somewhat libertarian."
"Valid points. He is pretty much a Democratic Party reject. I never pictured him as remotely libertarian before he switched parties. In my eyes he's Joe Biden-lite. I would likely never consider voting for him, just was curious to see if he could gain tractin. Honestly, I wouldn't mind Gary Johnson again, but it probably wouldn't look very good if the LP propped up the same guy three times in a row."

His record is the opposite of libertarian:"
These new genders are getting out of hand
"I happy for this! I think this is good for the LP! They need legitimate candidates and Liberty Linc has served all three levels of government, Local, State, and Federal. Let’s go!"
"Having government experience isn't enough. The nominee should be somewhat libertarian, and Lincoln is not remotely libertarian. His record is atrocious."

Yeah it's a good thing there aren't any innocent people in those properties including mostly non-americans. It would totally just stick it to Trump without pissing off the rest of the world who is currently on their side.
my guess is its mostly just to scare people from staying at trump properties so that he loses money
Unfortunately he doesn’t own most of “his” properties. Just licensing deals for the brand.
"This is actually a fantastic idea for them.  It wouldn't take more than a single, deniable terrorist incident at a hotel with his name on it in a foreign country for his businesses to be absolutely tanked"

"He views Trump as his daddy, so naturally he gets extremely upset when people talk out against his daddy"
"He calls me a tankie, too. In the same thread where I was defending pure capitalism and personal nuke ownership."
He calls everyone a tankie if they criticize Trump because he's a little authoritarian that craves to be subjugated.
First time i saw him use it he wasnt even using it correctly. I suppose at least he listens to some criticism lmao.
He's a noise troll. <strong>Do not</strong> respond to him.
He calls them tankies because he's a tankie. A Panzer tankie but a tankie none the less.
"If you want to know what a trump supporter believes, just listen to what they accuse you of"

"Great idea, realy"
Its great watching redditors non ironically cheer for international terrorism on American soil.
Well some of the properties aren't on American soil. 
Also we're not sure if they're cheering the idea of actual attacks or just the threat of attacks.
"Because threatening to attack Trump's properties could be argued to be a ""Great Idea"" especially in response to Trumps threat to destroy Iranian Cultural sites which is a war crime."
"Because realistically, should we as Americans give a shit if a Trump hotel in Turkey gets bombed any more than if a Hyatt in Turkey gets bombed?   "
"I'd say ""No.""  We regularly ignore that shit all of the time as ""Not our Business."""
Soooo if the President reacts to threats on his personal businesses which he lied about removing himself from as if they are attacks on America - that sort of says more about our situation than anything.
Then again if they attack a bunch of Americans in America I'll be pretty pissed.  
So all things considered I'd rather us not be in a pissing match of threats with a nation that supports terrorism.
"It's funny when people describe Iran as a nation that funds terrorism when we literally trained and funded the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS and a slew of other radical groups throughout the world."
How the fuck is it funny?
​
"Its what they do, they are fighting a proxy war for decades with Saudia Arabia as the other nation fighting in the proxy war in the Middle East."
"Its what (the US) do, they are fighting a proxy war for decades with (Iran/Russia/China) as the other nation fighting in the proxy war in the Middle East."
Glad you are an Iran sympathizer.
Glad you eat up propaganda and have an inability to understand nuance.
Maybe pick up a book instead of insinuating someone's ignorance. Seems someone already warps their mind base of social media bubble. 
​
You probably don't know the following three decades after the American puppet regime was overturned in Iran.
"I know that the US had also armed and trained multiple organizations we now consider to be terrorists, often to fight ""Communists"" and sometimes to fight whoever we point them at. Do you disagree?"
Humor is subjective so what's funny to me might not be funny to you.
Guess if you can't explain the joke then its not really a joke then.
Sorry that's not how humor works. If you dont get it that's ok.
Its ok you suck at telling jokes.
Oooh you really got me there.
Well what do you want me to do? Call the United States a terrorist nation?  
We call them terrorists because it suits us.  We called military aged men militants because it suited us and made us feel better when we blew them up.  
"One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.  I'm looking at that as ""another man"" but I accept your view on things."
Do you not call a thief a thief because he comes from your country? I am in no way superior to you or your opinions just an honest question.
"I call the thief a thief, but I don't say that America is a nation that supports thieves.   "
"And honestly, that statement even by itself can be argued."
"America and Iran both have very active militia membership. However in the United States, those militias essentially stay within our borders and don't operate as proxy arms of our military.  Iran uses their militias to wage military campaigns that they can disavow in the same way that we use mercenaries."
And the nearly twenty years since 9/11 has me associate their militia more with terrorism than freedom fighters or conventional American militia.  
"So rightly or wrongly, I see their actions by proxy as closer to terrorism.  Whereas  I see America's actions by proxy closer to ""Policing / Occupation"".  "
"I think there are solid arguments that America has no business doing these things the way that we've done, and that it's been a huge wasteful mistake costing millions of lives and trillions of dollars and I'm willing to say we should just not be in places where we aren't welcome."
But I have a hard time saying that because we funded and trained people in Cuba to overthrow the government that we funded terrorists and not a coup.   I think it was a mistake.
But that's the kind of shit I have to live with. 
"We pardoned a guy who bragged about running ""Concentration Camps"" (his words) in the United States.   Do we support Concentration Camps?  I'd like to say ""no"" but we have a fucky history don't we?"
but I don't say that America is a nation that supports thieves. 
"What the fuck lol. You don't call America a nation that supports terrorists, when it objectively supports terrorist as a nation."
You could say it's not a <em>terrorist nation</em> but it is indisputably a nation that supports terrorists
"Well, technically terrorists are who <em>we</em> say are terrorists."
"When we supported Al Qaeda we were supporting ""Freedom Fighters."" "
Same with when we supported the Taliban.   
And the only record I've seen of us supporting ISIS was enabling it to form whilst also training the New Iraqi Army so piss poorly that they just gave ISIS their American military equipment.
And you can argue that it is just a shitty semantical rule to wiggle out of having to say that we support terrorists.  
"And I'd agree with you.  But it is what it is.  Iran calls us terrorists but to the rest of the world, or our major allies at least they wouldn't dare call us terrorists. "
"We've destabilized regimes for decades around the world, often democratically elected leaders.  "
But our allies know we aren't terrorists.
"Whether there's a Democrat in charge, or a Republican, the people who are terrorists are the ones we say are terrorists. "
"Which is why when we negotiate with the Taliban some more this year for a draw down in Afghanistan, it won't be negated by ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"" talk.   Because we'll call them ""Tribal Leaders."""
"Isn't that neat?  The Taliban goes from ""Freedom Fighters"" (yay Rambo III), to Terrorists, to Tribal Leaders.   "
"<strong>And it's all because we say so, even though the only thing that changed was the nationality of the people they were blowing up.</strong>"
This is some next level MURICA.
Maybe it's not in any official capacity but I guarantee plenty of western allies see republicans especially as terrorists
"You've basically made a wall of text saying ""it's only terrorism if we agree with calling ourselves terrorists""."
America funds terrorists. It doesn't matter what you designate them in official capacity when.
What a non argument
So all things considered I'd rather us not be in a pissing match of threats with a nation that supports terrorism.
"What do you think these fucking idiots are gonna do? Targeted attack on just a empty building or kill every family inside a occupied building? Honestly fuck your retard answer, just get the fuck out of here and go jihad with them!"
"Honestly fuck your retard answer,"
We civil as fuuuuuuuck bruh.
I don't think you're even coherent at this point you're so upset.  
I don't think Iran is going to level a golf course if that's what you're asking.   I also don't think Iran has the stomach to blow up a hotel. 
"But if you're asking me if I think we should care whether or not a hotel blows up in Turkey and it's a Hyatt or a Trump Tower, I'm going to tell you that we should feel the same about it."
"And we either care about that hotel and any others that come under attack, or we don't give a shit because it isn't our business."
I also don't think Iran has the stomach to blow up a hotel.
Am I arguing with fucking 10 year olds? Do you have any idea of their track record of atrocities?
We talking about Aleppo during the Syrian civil war?  
Nobody in the World gave an actual shit about the Syrian people as seen by how no nation did anything to actually stop the gassing of civilians.   So don't compare genocides and war crimes in Yemen and Syria to hitting a non-warzone with a terror attack.
"Seriously, Iran has you hot as fuck angry so go ball out with your comparable list of atrocities."
"But on the same hand, Russia blows up shit on the daily and dropped a civilian air liner out of the fucking sky, but they still knew better than to put their name on that."
", Iran has you hot as fuck angry so go ball out with your comparable list of atrocities."
"No its you spineless self loathing losers cheering for terrorist attacks because of how fucking butthurt you are. We did one drone strike and killed a fucking terrorist, get over it. Iran will get over it too because they have ZERO other option."
Oh so you <em>don't</em> have a list of atrocities?
Neat - O.
"Off to war we go I guess because you simultaneously believe that Iran will ""Get Over It"" but also that anything they do is worth war level military action over. "
"And make no mistake, assassinating a General via drone strike is a war level military action.   "
"But a CIA agent that popped him with a sniper rifle or any other method, like maybe an IED?  Maybe that wasn't us.  Oh all the evidence says it is but that's how proxy wars work."
Sheesh you're a hothead but you've got nothing but anger.
Oh so you don't have a list of atrocities?
"Oh hey they shot down a plane full of Civilians at almost the EXACT same time you made this retard comment, that is simply amazing. Maybe shut the fuck up next time?"
Let’s have this list filtered down to properties in red districts. 
Trump was probably salivating at the thought of an attack on a major city like Los Angeles or New York which are mostly democratic.
People were trying to make Trump look like the immature one.
What does socialism have to do with this?

His account was bought most likely

"Constitution would still provide the president with sufficient authority to use force to prevent a future attack on American troops, personnel, or facilities abroad."
"This is the crux of it.  But every time I hear Pompeo or someone else talk, they speak incredibly vaguely about future imminent attacks, and then immediately resort to historical acts by Soleimani."
Retribution for past acts is not the same as preventing future acts.
because the “future attack” is just another lie used to excuse warmongering.
"Most likely, yes.  "
"And if so, this would be cause for removal, unlike Russian collusion or Ukrainian aid.  But do the American people have any appetite left for impeachment."
The future attack it's the retaliation that they provoked. 
"Aka, a self fulfilling prophecy"
The thing about Iran's Soleimoni is you can guarentee he was going to have a future attack on American troops.  Its his job title in a nutshell. His whole job was assisting terrorist in hunting their enemies. America is his enemy.
The vagueness is because they didn't know what the attack is. They do know he would do it because its his job. Its like suggesting a creecher soldier will bomb someone. Its the job title.

"Neither the President, nor any other single individual, should ever have the authority to unilaterally start a war.  Only protective measures from specific and imminent threats."

"Alas. He does. And Republicans wont remove it from him. Democrat wont remove it from their presidents, and libertarian are somewhere picking daisies."
"No American law prohibits the targeting of specific enemy leaders. Neither the Constitution nor federal statutes prevent the direct targeting of individual members of the enemy. Only Executive Order 12,333, issued by President Reagan in 1981, states that “no person employed or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.” This was a continuation of a similar ban first issued by President Gerald Ford in 1976, which was subsequently reaffirmed by President Carter, and has been followed by every president since."

"The NewsHour dedicated a good portion of Friday's coverage to the drone strike, and a lot of the commentators shared the same concern, that there is no diplomatic solution in the short term.  They noted that both countries are increasingly aggressive in their actions, and that the killing of the Iranian General will almost require a response from Iran so that they leadership does not appear weak or lose face.  And I think it's fair to say the same goes for Trump in an election year.  They all noted that they do not see any type of diplomatic off ramp for this escalation of tensions/aggression.  That is my biggest concern in this situation, especially now that Iran has formally backed out of the nuclear agreement, and we have burned a lot of diplomatic bridges with the EU and other allies that were working with Iran to keep that agreement in place."

I know right.  I don't know why Trump Jr. tries so hard.
He has a right to put whatever he wants on his rifle magazines. I don't like the Trump family either but this is a stupid article and a stupid place to post it.
He has that right and I have the right to call him stupid for it.
I'm not debating that I'm just telling you this is a stupid post and no one other than the far left actually cares what pictures he has on his rifle magazines
I care because that's the kind of toxic gun culture that gives guns a bad name for the rest of us.
God you guys are such a fucking snowflakes. If some left gun owner had a picture of trump behind bars on his magazine you redhat faggots would do nothing but scream about it all day fucking long.

"If US troops are kicked out of Iraq, and if Iran manages to show some restraint, this might be a net win after all."
Iran? Restraint? You are certainly an optimist.
Looks like the end result from this is a nuclear armed Iran with close alliance with Iraq. Pretty funny the Iraq War resulted in a significantly strengthened Iran.
Iran about to get nukes = Israel attacking Iran to prevent it = U.S. attacking Iran.
"Equals probably the end of Israel, Saudia Arabia, Iran and US force projection."
"Maybe the intentional use of US force projection, but make no mistake, the US would absolutely be capable of fighting a war with Iran and maintaining the MIC."
"I'm sure they could in the sense they have the tech, weapons and resources to do it but how many Americans are ready to go get their arms and legs blown off fighting Iran?"
The same number that signed up last time. The US will of course make up some shit to get the useful idiots to sign up.
If it ends Saudi Arabia I'll take it
Its almost as if this plays right into the hands of Putin.
"More so it plays into the hands of China. They are working 24 hrs a day for technological superiority over the USA, they are getting close and every war the USA gets into the further the US falls behind."
Iran is more closely aligned with Russia than China.
True and irrelevant.
"Fair points, I would just like to say that both can be true. I think Trump is more likely to help Putin than Xi but I could be wrong."
"It certainly does help Putin, that's why Putin had him elected."

The US better arm the Iraqis if they leave or the Iranians are gonna slaughter them. The only thing Iranians hate more than Americans are Sunni Muslims.
The majority of Iraqis are Shia Muslims.
That doesn’t mean it’s okay to slaughter the minority.
Of course not.
"But this is just business as usual for the Middle East. When Sunni-backed Saddam was in control of Iraq, he slaughtered ethnic minorities and Shia majority Muslims both."
"Saudi Arabia executes gays, women, and non-Muslims for medieval era crimes."
"That's just how that part of the world works, unfortunately."
The Kurds aren’t working that way.  Neither is Jordan. And hopefully we won’t either.
"Sorry to say, but the Kurds have been apart of terrorist killings in Turkey. Kurdish military group YPK has orchestrated bombings and shootings of innocent civilians in Turkey."
More specifically the PKK and its offshoots.
Iraqi Kurds?
Yes. Iraqi Kurds. They're involved with various paramilitary groups which have targeted Turkish civilians in the past.
Are you talking about the Iran that unrestrainedly shot some 200 protestors recently?
No I think he's talking about the Iran who sent a terrorist into Baghdad who got killed for ya know being a terrorist.
Sent *their equivalent of the Chair of the Joint Chiefs as a peace messenger. Who got killed because trump literally abused the white flag of parley.
**send their peace messenger to organize a terrorist attack on a U.S. embassy
What's the superior alternative?
It comes back to the old question: should the US be the world’s police? 
"Most libertarians (and I think most people inside and outside the US) agree the US should mind its business, but as a foreigner in the US I can tell you Americans have big hearts. They see children in Syria being torn to pieces, see horrible oppression in North Korea, see Venezuela ravaged by socialism and feel they should do something about this. "
"If Americans want to retreat from the world they should get ready to see absolutely horrifying women, children, LGBT, minority and human rights abuses world wide and be ready to NOT do anything about it. Quite frankly I don’t think most people realize how bad it would get and I don’t think we are ready to witness it"
The US does mind its own business as it protects trade routes like the Strait of Hormuz and ensures tyrants and autocrats don't exclude the US and its allies from global markets.
"Some decisions are terrible, but if you don't want the US to be ""world police"" then get ready for China, Russia and others to be the world police."
"You want ""no world police"" okay tell that to Russia and China LOL"
Noone would object to non-military humanitarian missions.
"I'm not big on military interventionism, but do you really think non-military humanitarian missions are going to change anything for countries like Saudi Arabia? For example, even if almost certainly the most extreme of the Middle East, this is a government that's been run based on Sharia law for literally centuries, criminalizing and executing their people for being LGBT or committing adultery, where religious freedom doesn't exist as a concept, and the <em>vast majority</em> of the people are absolutely okay with it. It was considered a massive breakthrough on international news when they legalized <em>women driving,</em> and that's after several years of non-violent protests where women were imprisoned, tortured and executed."
I would say don't start military invasions before you solve all other problems that allow for peaceful solutions. There is a lot of poverty and suffering in the world where people would welcome help and it would bring a lot more QoL improvements for the world as a whole for the same buck to go there first.
Fair enough
"They see children in Syria being torn to pieces, see horrible oppression in North Korea, see Venezuela ravaged by socialism and feel they should do something about this. "
They see this because the us foreign services beat the drums of war and us media takes up the call every single time. It's not a coincidence that every group you mentioned is aligned against us political interests. 
"I've lived in America too, and I struggle to see this extraordinary empathetic war advocacy you're talking about. They pay lip service to moral war goals but when the US military just up and murders everyone theres never any popular support for institutional reform of the military and to this day it consistently ranks as the most trusted institution in the country, despite nothing about it deserving such public trust."
"If America wants to bring about superior moral environments by force then first it needs to acquire the capability to actually do so, because all they're capable of right now is piling up corpses then tripping over them."
"American intervention does little to nothing to fix any of those things and usually just results in bombing, raping, and torturing innocent civilians including the women and children you mention. Oh, and also greater profits for weapons manufacturing and oil executives. Can’t forget about that one."
Now this is a very optimistic take
4d chess
Iran manages to show some restraint
good luck with that
When did Iran  last start a war?
When did Iran  last start a war? 
"They already have half a dozen proxy wars going on atm, mostly aimed at fighting against Saudi backed fighters in the ME.  On top of that Iran could go back to attacking oil tankers, attacking Saudi Oil Refineries, drive more instability in Sunni areas of Iraq, the list goes on.  Iran has the advantage of picking the place and time, along with being very friendly with the new Shia led Iraqi government (why they are kicking out the US now) along with Syria's government.  Their reach has become great since the fall of Saddam."
"They already showed restraint by continuing to abide by their nuclear agreement. In this situation, Iran showing restraint would be to only assassinate a US political figure."
Aaaand they are no longer honoring their part of the nuclear deal.
Not really unexpected.
Oh not at all. The JCPOA was surely flawed but President Trump has offered nothing better. It is far easier to tear down a building than to erect one.
This would never have happened if they had nukes
They already showed restraint by continuing to abide by their nuclear agreement.
Iran has been violating it for at least a year. It's been a political issue for Europe.
"They weren't complying with some of the restrictions the deal would have required were it in place, but they were incapable of actually violating the deal after the US broke it in 2018."
Hell the sanctions themselves blocked Iran from fully complying. It's hard to export potential nuclear weapons precursors that the civilian process produces as a byproduct when the US sanctions block them.
"In this situation, Iran showing restraint would be to only assassinate a US political figure."
Maybe we can let them drone strike Bush and Cheney and call it even?
"Or how about the drone king Obama himself, if we are looking to see a former US leader killed?  How dumb are you?"
"Also, and this is no way meant to be Obama apologia, it's almost certain that Trump already surpassed Obama months ago as the ""Drone King"" well before his first term is even up. So yes I say send them all to the Hague."

Good! Pull the fuck out of Iraq. I'm sure most would agree
"Except for when Trump tried to do so, he was totally lambasted for his efforts in leaving Iraq open for Russia to take over, you know, because he is Putin's pawn and all that."
"That is the problem with current year political analysts. When Trump cooperates with country X he is the bootlicker of X’s government, but if he is combative with country Y, he is going to plunge us into WWIII with Y. "
Analysts are as bombastic and extreme in their language as Trump.
"He’ll remove some token number of troops, people who will criticize him no matter what will do their thing and then he’ll send more troops back"
"Trump gets lambasted for whatever he does. He attacks, he’s a warmonger, he withdraws, he’s dishonoring the sacrifice of our soldiers."
"He says he will bomb cultural sites, people act like its equivalent of the Taliban bombing the Buddha’s.  He tells the Kurds to give up their defensive positions then leaves so they are quickly overpowered and has an air base fall into Russian hands... as if that couldn’t have been handled better!"
"He bombs an Iranian leader, gets legislation passed saying US troops must leave Iraq, he threatens the legislators saying if they make us leave they will suffer, like a leader of democracy who exemplifies rule of law."
"Zero to complain about.  Everything he does is perfect.
/s"
"It's almost like when you look at them as a whole, and the individual context of each, he's incompetently making rash decisions without thinking them true."
I like how the fact that he fails both ways is proof that he's vindicated
he flipflops because he's right! Both times!
"More importantly, when Trump's predecessor tried to pull us out Iraqis didn't step up and defend their own sovereignty, and the power vacuum we left behind was filled by ISIS/ISIL.  If we leave this time the vacuum will be filled by Iran.  Sadly, that probably mean the Shia population in Iraq initiating sectarian violence against the country's Kurds and Sunnis."
"Sounds good.  Bring em home.  While we are at it, bring home troops from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanastan, Kuwait, and every other desert hell hole over there and leave them all to kill each other like they have been for thousands of years."
But... Muh oil and arms sales

That totally won't result in worldwide terrorist attacks. Good plan!
Correct
"maybe terrorism is a rational response to extended attack and occupation by US forces, and if we stop subjugating them they’ll stop having to defend themselves."
Surely generations of anger and hatred will disappear over night!
"so your solution is to continue to create generations of anger and hatred, continuing the evil that we justified with lies? it’s too late to stop sinning so keep going?"
Or maybe there's a middle ground between starting yet another war and creating a power vacuum in the region?
"there is no middle ground. they cannot invade us. if we leave, they may continue fighting, but with less firepower and less justified hatred towards the foreign body. these people are not children and they deserve autonomy."
surely perpetuating it further will speed up the process!
Sounds good to me. Are we supposed to be outraged over this or something?
Democracy for Iraq until they vote for something we don't like.  Zero chance we abide by this.
"Well, yeah. They voted. We didn't. When Gaza elected internationally recognized terrorists to lead them, that didn't mean we suddenly love suicide bombings. Democracy is a way of making group decisions. Different groups can still disagree."
"""Well, yeah. They voted. We didn't ""  So the US gets to make decisions over another country sovereignty ? interesting .  Well i guess i ll just move into my neighbor's house and tell him that i didn t agree to it when he tells me to get out."
Bring a friend with you so that you will have democratic majority.
Looks like Iraq needs a bit more liberating! Time for regime change! Isn't that the American solution to everything?
Democracy for Iraq 
"<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-05/iraq-parliament-expel-u-s-military-qassem-soleiman"" rel=""nofollow"">It's hardly ""democracy"" when there was just barely a quorum for the vote because it was boycotted by Sunni and Kurd members of the parliament.</a>"
"Something like 60% of the voting population in this country doesn't vote.  By your definition, we're not a democracy.  They voted according to their rules.  That's democracy.  Are you going to say we can ignore the results because we don't think a sufficient number of their representatives voted?"
Apparently they voted that we have to leave sometime and it’s not binding.  Who knows.  It’s going to be a mess since the Kurds will want us to stay.  And maybe they don’t get the right to choose.
This would be perfect! This is the way out.
"Fine, but that means no US embassies. No embassies means no US citizens. 
Without troops for defense, any embassy or consulate would be overrun in a day. "
"Pack everything up, pull everyone out. No Americans in Iraq, ever."
Inshallah.
"FYI, minority Sunni and Kurds refused to participate in this vote. It was Shia only. Iran is Shia. "
"So we can pull our troops out, but that’s exactly what Iran wants. Then Iran is clear to invade Iraq. 
Probably inevitable with Saddam gone. Thanks Bush!"
Still had over 50% of the vote.
Good. Bring them home
"For posterity, I am going to make an important prediction:  The facts will show that Iranian general Soleimani was not in Iraq for military reasons when he was bombed by the US, but rather was there for peace negotiations <strong>orchestrated by the Trump administration via discussions with Saudi Arabia.</strong>"
"Iraq's Parliament today voted to expel all US troops from Iraq because, according to Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, ""[w]hat happened was a political assassination.""  According to him, ""Soleimani was in Baghdad to meet with him about a Saudi request for dialogue to relieve tensions in the region—not, as the U.S. has claimed, to plan attacks against American forces."" <a href=""https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/05/iraqi-parliament-votes-expel-all-american-troops-and-submit-un-complaint-against-us"">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/05/iraqi-parliament-votes-expel-all-american-troops-and-submit-un-complaint-against-us</a>"
What do peace negotiations requested by Saudi Arabia have to do with the US?  One need read only the tea leaves to see the obvious red flag:
"<strong>12/30/2019 - US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss ""efforts to enhance security and stability"" in the region.</strong> <a href=""https://www.arabnews.com/node/1606201/saudi-arabia"">https://www.arabnews.com/node/1606201/saudi-arabia</a>"
Three days later ...
"1/2/2020 - Iranian general Solimani travels to Iraq, reportedly at the request of Saudi Arabia, to meet with the Iraqi PM.  The US knew he was coming and bombed him at the airport upon arrival.  <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-02/iran-general-qassem-suleimani-killed-airstrike-baghdad-airport"">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-02/iran-general-qassem-suleimani-killed-airstrike-baghdad-airport</a>"

"People need to read this. The US has just violated one of the oldest tenets of war, we just killed someone under a flag of truce. Now NO ONE will trust us for negotiations, they don't know if they are showing up to talk or deliver a message, or to be assassinated."
Maybe trump found a secret way out of the Iraq war be such a bad guest they kick you out.
Still hoping for that 4d chess move eh?
I hate war so yes I’m hoping we have a way out of war.
It's their country their call. We don't need them to fight Iran but hopefully it gives Iraq and Iran some breathing room and things can calm down.
"Assassination sure, political assassination, meh. Dude would be a legit military target."
If they were at war...
What do you call hundreds of Americans killed by Iranian militias?
"Trump's been surprisingly restrained up until now. Iran attacks our allies, our troops, international shipping and shoots down a drone, and he did nothing. Even some Obama era Iran appeasers were starting to call them a threat to US interests."
Then declare war. And maybe stop threatening war crimes by deliberately targeting 52 non-strategic and non-military cultural sites.
52 non-strategic
Delusion beyond belief.  Targeting petroleum sites would collapse entire Iranian regime.
"Well if a nation kills hundreds of you people and you got a problem with it you got that thing called"" war declaration"" you fucking own your shit ."
What do you call hundreds of Americans killed by Iranian militias?
Maybe they're still mad about the 100's of Iranian civilians we killed when we shot down a commercial airliner in the 80's.
"Mahdi said Soleimani was in Baghdad to meet with him about a Saudi request for dialogue to relieve tensions in the region—not, as the U.S. has claimed, to plan attacks against American forces."
He was only there for peace talks but those talks are a guise to lure him there to be assassinated. He was a political target in this situation.
"So it's he says/he says and despite not knowing anything, you've somehow managed to determine which 'he' is telling the truth. Fascinating."
Well the US made the claim he was there for terrorist attacks and we haven t seen any proof of that . You know how the burden of proof works right ? If you claim shit then prove that shit .
Oh do you have a link to the proof Iraq provided for their claim that he was traveling back from peace talks?  You do know how burden of proof works right?
"You do know that the Iraqi pm stated he was there for talks with the saudi right ? Do you realize  that Iraq is a sovereign state ? They decide who s welcome and who s not in their country .  The guy was at a fucking international airport , he wasn t hiding or sneaking around ...he was a guest ."
The PM literally said he organized the trip - what more could you want?
US committed perfidy. Fucking low.
"Now we're going to see whether Trump respects Iraq as a sovereign nation or not - we still have a lot of troops and equipment in Iraq. Will we follow orders and leave, or refuse and likely spark a rebellion against us there?"
What a fucking idiot Trump is
Bahahahahaha. Trump respecting others... bahahahahaha
It's funny because orange man bad!!!! Get it???

I know this comes as a shock but the people running Iraq are agents of Iran. The current prime minister is a member of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq which was founded in Iran and its members fought for Iran in the Iraq-Iran war. The militias of this party have Iranian officers. The whole point of Trump's action was to check Iranian influence. This is btw a non-binding resolution.
I know this comes as a shock but the people running Iraq are agents of Iran.
"So what? It's their fucking country! If they want to be friendly to Iran, it's their choice to"
"Now fuck off, Redcap"
You undermine your otherwise good point with juvenile insults.
"But no, it's not really their country. It exists artificially, first as an imperial territory of the Ottomans, then the British, then briefly under rule of a brutal dictator, and now under reconstruction by the US. The people ruling it now were placed there by us to restore some semblance of order, and even that's been a rocky road."
"If it were left completely alone, it would split into 3 or 4 countries based on regional ethnicities."
Then so be it ? What happened to the right to self determination ?
"So what? It's their fucking country! If they want to be friendly to Iran, it's their choice to"
Now do Trump and Russia.  Or is that off the table now?  I can never get the stories straight.
Trump is not a country.
That’s not what his waistline says.  Heyooo!
"Whether this is relevant to the US depends on what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92myDzAFgU4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> people ultimately want."
"The thing about those people is that they have a reason for chanting that stuff, and it's to do with America's actions in <em>their countries</em>."
"If any country were doing in the US so much as half of what the US has done and continues to do in their countries, you'd be chanting death to that country as well. "
"It's always so insane to see people defend all this shit and then go ""oh my god have you heard what those nasty people are saying about us?!"" "
"Yeah, of course they're saying that stuff, it's a response to what we're doing. So would you be."
Yes Shias are friendly with each other. This is not some great mystery.
Who could've possible seen this coming?
"Good, this is trumps chance to pull out of iraq, im sure this will help him in the election"
Sadly this is essentially a symbolic gesture. 
The Iraqi government has no way to enforce this resolution (i.e. to force US troops out of the country). 
"In addition, I think the Iraqis know that, like it or not, they rely heavily on US military presence for security and stability. "
"Finally, the country’s largest monetary benefactor is — wait for it — the US. No way they’ll jeopardize that revenue stream. "
The whole thing is just incredibly distressing and upsetting. Things were bad enough before we ordered a political assassination in a sovereign country. You know shit is fucked up when Iran and Iraq are aligned...
"In addition, I think the Iraqis know that, like it or not, they rely heavily on US military presence for security and stability. "
According to middle east sources this vote went the way it did because Iran backed terrorist threatened any MP who voted to allow the US to stay and did kill ones family possibly.

"Hezbollah threatens Iraqi parliament, Kurdistan region"
"The political office of the Iraqi Hezbollah guerrillas threatened members of the Iraqi parliament and the Kurdistan Regional Government, and said, ""Kurdish forces tend to keep these forces for purposes related to dreams of secession."""
"The statement of the political office of the Iraqi Hezbollah Party stressed the necessity of canceling the strategic framework agreement with the United States, threatening those who reject this decision that ""this session will be a ruling on the political forces and personalities that will be with the people and unity of Iraq, or those that tend to have narrow interests and suspicious links and its national, sectarian, or factional tendencies, and it records a black supply in the register of traitors, sellers of conscience and honor, and our people will not accept any excuse or justification. """
"The statement also directed its threat to ""some Kurdish forces tend to keep these forces for purposes related to dreams of secession."""
"The statement concluded with a direct threat to Parliament, saying: ""These days in the history of Iraq, we will not hesitate to expose traitors and conspirators against the sovereignty of our homeland, and we will deny them entry to Baghdad and prevent them from dealing with them, and we will not allow their interests to continue."""
"The Hezbollah Brigades had warned Iraqi security to approaching US bases starting from Sunday, in reference to attacks on US bases in Iraq."
Could cause problems for supply routes to US bases. The green zone may have to completely abandoned as unsupportable along with rocket attacks on it.
Lmao and how exactly do they plan to enforce that?
"Oh no, they're writing a formal complaint to the UN? Not that. Anything but that..."
That's right.  Fuck them.  We're the ones who brought them democracy so we get to ignore any votes we don't like.   They're a vassal state and they better get used to it.  Democratic votes only count when they suite our interests.
Tribal and religious loyalties once again manifesting themselves in Middle East politics
Fuck Iran.
So brave
"This is very good news! The U.S. should certainly accept this and pull out. Like Chess, Iran has been put into check by the killing this vicious leader (smart move branding his organization a ""terrorist organization"" months ago). Like Risk, the U.S. presence in Iraq can be forfeited due to troops stacked all round that territory including carrier strike forces and Marine amphibious forces en route. Trump at this point will go into election fulfilling a campaign promise of getting the U.S. out if Iraq and can also say before he did he killed another key terrorist leader. I guess get your popcorn and wait to see what happens next!"
Ok i ll try to explain to you why this is a disaster.  
If the US pulls out of Iraq now then Iran obtains precisely the thing they were seeking by doing what the general was doing ... do you get that ? They didn't fund militias in Iraq for fun . They did it to get the US out of Iraq and away from their borders . So now they get it as a Christmas gift .  
And it gets even better because they can spread their influence in Iraq without military intervention and no opposition from the west .  So the end result is a worse position than before the invasion of Iraq ...that s what s called a critical failure .
"Finally they are standing up for themselves, good for them."
That's awesome. I hope that place doesn't turn into a shit hole now.
Hey I think we were there with permission from the pm and had nothing to do with their Parliament. So does this matter or just a show?
Must be this 4d chess Trump blowhards are all talking about
Good
Good for them.
Trump just pulled all the troops out of Iraq. Art of the deal.
"Good...pack up and leave, take payment from them for every penny we spent plus $1mill for each American killed/wounded over there, and leave the Iraqi people books on how to speak Farsi because they will need it once we're gone."
We destroyed iraq. The people there don’t owe us a single damn thing

I know its closer to international standards but blue for Tories and red for Labour confused me for way longer then I care to admit.
"Tbf, the Democratic party would be center/center-right in most other countries."
"Depends. Socially, yes. Economically? No. (UK only)."
A single line doesnt work. Also plenty of further right parties in the EU now then Democrat on multiple issues.
"Italy, France, UK. All have heavy right wing immigration parties compared to DNC. Poland has shifted heavily right to fight ""communism."""
Far right parties don't make centrist parties less centrist.
"Corbyn was a republican who supported land-values taxation, and Labour party was opposed to increasing VAT. Labour under Corbyn was, on certain issues, <em>more</em> libertarian than either Tories or Lib-Dems. Their defeat, on some issues, was a loss for libertarianism."
If American right libertarianism is popular in the UK its the result of dark money propaganda and the americanization of the UK.

If cops cared about violating constitutional rights we'd live in a far different country.
"Cops aren't going to get fired over this, much less go to jail for it.  They might slow-walk enforcement to a degree, but they'll enforce it some (probably selectively against poor people and minorities), and when they do it'll just be more heavy-handed.  They'll just tear gas your house and shoot your dog to avoid the possibility of someone shooting back if that's what they're worried about."
probably selectively against poor people and minorities

"His cultists will stay with him so long as he is around, but after he has an amphetamine stroke or a triple Big Mac induced coronary in the next couple years, his brand will die and his family name will turn to shit. His cultists won't stick with fucking Eric or Jr."
His name's legacy is going to be shit. It would have been better if he didn't run for president. 
"Sucks that he won't be alive to see that. As much of a narcissist as he is, that'd be worse than hell for him."
🙏🏻
Cultural sites....like the Taliban destroyed in Afghanistan before 2001?
Yes.  Just like the Taliban.  Was your point to compare authoritarians to authoritarians?
"Or like ISIS, which Soleimani and Iranian backed PMUs played a large part in defeating."
"They played a part, but not a large part. And it was mostly a feel-good excuse for the international community so Iran could better establish their presence in other countries in order to facilitate their national objectives, like supporting the Lebanese Hezbollah and taking subversive action against Israel. The Kurds had the greatest effects against ISIS. With our support, they took back the entire region of Syria east of the Euphrates."
"No, Iranian forces under Soleimani played a substantial part in ground operations during Iraq's fight against ISIS especially in the Siege of Amirli and the retaking of Tikrit. I'm aware that this is part of Iran's larger goal of creating a buffer on their border while they also take actions to defend their allies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. This also includes subversive actions against US allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia as well as undermining orher governments in the area, but I'm not going to hand wring too much when all those governments have been doing many of the same tactics (or substantially worse in the case of Saudi Arabia) while engaged in the ongoing proxy war with Iran."
"Yup, trump is working his hardest to put us on the same moral ground as the Taliban"
"Ah yes, let’s be just like the Taliban or ISIS..."
This comment couldn't be less relevant had you actually tried.
"“Pay us back for the base we built, from the war you never asked for.” "
This fucking guy has got to go
You'd think most people would realize Iraq has paid enough at this point. They got handed a massive disaster they wanted no part of and now we're talking about how they owe us? Absolute insanity. The cost they paid with their people's lives should be more than enough to forget any financial debts but when we're the ones blowing shit up over there for years I can't see how anyone could be so delusional to think we're owed anything out of that war.
I'd say 1.4 dead Iraqis is enough
"and watch them just take it. Is the USA really going to start a war over a military base, when we just left one in Syria no questions asked?"
Gave it to our loyal comrades and allies Russia
"""Iran-backed insurgents have captured Iraqi airbase..."""
"There's a pre-prepared spin here, regardless of who takes any action in Iraq, or how popular that action is."
"we all know he does not give a shit about the base, this is a pissing contest and his feelings were hurt."
Trump would.
And how much does the US owe to Iraq for the nearly 200.000 dead civilians ?
$170 billion in multiple currencies loaded on pallets on a plane
"That was Iranian money that we seized and were about to lose a court case to give back. Because like I said, it was Iran’s money."
Wait a sec the US paid Iraq 170 billion dollars ? Source ?
"I've been reading this as iran the entire time, ya iraq doesn't owe us shit, we fucked their country up, but I mean if we went into civil war, it would be which ever party is president vs the opposing party, then libertarians would be another faction, but foreign governments would have to choose a side"
I don t see the relevance to the fact that Trump claims Iraq owes the US billions .
"Is the US gonna pay for 2 decades of destroyed roads, hospitals, towns, parks, sewers, and other shit that we destroyed cause we treated Iraq like an open battlefield?"
I mean...bombing a major airport alone is gonna cost a lot of money eh?
"Iran, probably: ""We'll pay for the air base when Mexico pays for the wall."""
Dont we owe them money for slaughtering their people and bombing their cities?
"I sincerely hope the Iraqis reply with ""Sure we will repay for the airbase, once you get done repaying for all the damage you've done to our country and all the people you've killed here"""
"Excellent job, Republicans"
It amazes me how Trump continually tops himself. Just when I think he can't get any worse he manages to surprise me.
"Well, this presidency is a non-stop dumpster fire."
"Just yesterday, I was reading all the people excited that the US would be leaving. Leave it to Trump to piss off Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians all in one go."

"Fuck Iran, we shouldn’t have had diplomatic relationships with them in the first place. They are obviously set on nuclear weapons even with the nuclear treaty, and they hate our way of life. Trump is just ripping the band-aid off instead of coming to a peaceful solution that I’m convinced doesn’t exist. I’m glad he’s put pressure on the Iranian economy to the point of bullying. They deserve it and need to learn that it won’t stop until they get along with other modern cultures around the world. "
"We have the power and resources to impose our will on them, so Iran has to deal with it, or pay the consequences. Look how quickly they resumed enriching uranium after the treaty broke, like they weren’t already trying. I’d rather just get a war over with than tip toe on egg shells with Iran, for the next however many decades."
Well the nuclear treaty you're speaking of they were following perfectly
"Trump, for literally no reason, voided that treaty"
Perfectly?  Looks like they were operating 60 centrifuges covertly.

"You seem determined to cover your tracks instead of admitting that prior to 2018 they had already violated the treaty according to the evidence; and at the same time you are admitted the new centrifuges were under construction??  They were supposed to stick to the older (slower) centrifuges, instead opted to put new (faster) ones in - despite the obvious restrictions in the treaty.  (personally, I don't blame them for upgrading for efficiency) "
"It's not like Iran was going to negotiate anyways, they were already operating outside the treaty."

More than half voted in favor of kicking them out.
It is just over 50% of the total actually.
They be inviting Iran to occupy the country next.
How is that our problem?
Because Iraq is of strategic importance to the US
"I'm not so sure that it's of ""strategic importance to the US"".  I think it is of strategic importance to certain plutocrats in the US.  As in most things, when they say ""important to the US"" they don't mean ""important to the US people""."
"Iran holds sway over Iraq. Iran threatens the oil in the Persian gulf. They get mad at the US and shit down the oil fields. Boom, you have the oil crisis of the 70’s on steroids. Do you think the American people care if gas is 5$ a gallon?"
"The US would probably just subsidize it.  The USA isn't a net importer of oil anymore, so these subsidies would go straight into the pockets of the same industries who pay lobbyists who elect the government.  I'm sure they'd have no qualms printing enough money to pay for it, given that we are already running a $1T deficit."
Price is a rationing tool. The problem is supply. We would not have enough oil.
"The USA produces enough oil domestically to supply all domestic needs; we import more oil than we export.  A price spike would hit China, who import more or less all of their oil, MUCH harder."
Never said it was. But you know these show your dick contests can get out of hand.
Good
"Looks like another country needs some ""freedom"""
Iraq shouldn't even be a country. Absurd mismatch of 3+ different ethic groups.
Let Iraq decide that
They had a civil war over it. And arguably they still are.
Then we need to get out the middle of it and let them figure it out
Couldn't agree more
Ethnic states are a good idea now?
Ethnic states are a good idea now?
They're pointing out that Iraq was formed by the British after World War I.
"It's not a country that formed ""organically"" by the wishes of locals, but instead was cobbled together by a distant colonial power out of Ottoman remnants in a way that never would have happened if locals had sorted out their own borders."
"Illustrating this is hardly anyone advocating for ""ethnic states,"" but you choose to strawman the point."
colonial 
ohhhhhhhhhhhh!
"No, but a groups of people with centuries old feuds make bad neighbors. Those same people removed from that situation can be good neighbors."
"I dunno, was France a good idea?"
"France has multiple ethnic groups, so does Spain, UK, America, Canada, Finland, Germany, etc."
"Yeah, but not really. The French live in france. There is a French nationality that is held above any other ethnic groups. And even though America is no where close to single ethic group, there is an undeniable American nationality. Iraq was founded on colonial trading, there isnt a nationality, they fucking hate each other. It's creation was a mistake. Maybe after 200 years of iron fist rule something related to a unique nationality would emerge. "
Do these people even wish to share a country? Obviously no. The Iraqi Kurdistan is a defacto separate country. The only reason it's not lawfully a country is because Turkish pressure. The Shia population essentially controls the government with the Sunnis in permeant opposition. This is why Iran meddles and this why ISIS exists.
Always were. It's pure biology. As animals we fear unknown and prefer known. Too many different groups will always cause friction and with democracy will cause even deeper conflicts of interested.
"we are animals who learned that we are actually animals, and then quickly forgot."
Look what happened to Yugoslavia.
Now part of 6 relatively productive countries.
"Sure, just took literally ethnic cleansing with a side of genocide to make it happen. We only bombed quite a bit of it and executed more the a few leaders too."
"Breakups are messy, but usually for the best."
what sovereignty lmfao Iran has their hand up Iraq's ass using them as a puppet
How'd they manage that considering America's been Billions at them for a decade+?
Could it be that occupying the middle east is a pointless waste of time?
It's immoral for the US to regime change to begin with.
It's ineffective if US can't stay there for decades to squash any violent uprising.
But US will never be able to do that because they change leaders so often. So it's pointless to bother with these regime change wars. Immoral and not possible.
I hope they come home but let's all agree thus means nothing. We were not there because of parliament we were there on a pm order so good on them but means nothing and they know it that's why they did it.

"It's called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_simple"">fee simple private property</a> and it was crafted out of the feudal era, as lords wanted more autonomy from the king, these would soon be called <em>landlords.</em> This meant freedom from bonded labor, freedom to sell and rent, and enclose. There are four limitations though; taxation, police power (law), eminent domain, and escheat (if you have no heirs after death the state assumes the property)."

"At the root of Marxism is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialist_conception_of_history"" rel=""nofollow"">materialist conception of history</a>, known as historical materialism for short. It holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production"" rel=""nofollow"">mode of production</a> and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle"" rel=""nofollow"">class struggle</a>. According to this analysis, the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into a new mode of production: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">capitalism</a>). Before capitalism, certain working classes had ownership of instruments utilized in production, but because machinery was much more efficient this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor, working through making use of someone else's machinery and therefore making someone else profit. Thus with capitalism the world was divided between two major classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism#cite_note-32"" rel=""nofollow"">[32]</a> These classes are directly antagonistic: the bourgeoisie has private ownership of the means of production and earns a profit off <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value"" rel=""nofollow"">surplus value</a>, which is generated by the proletariat, who has no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie."
"Historical materialism goes on and says: the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism, through the furtherance of its own material interests, captured power and abolished, of all relations of private property, only the feudal privileges and with this took out of existence the feudal ruling class. This was another of the keys behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production, which is the final expression of class and property relations and also has led into a massive expansion of production. It is therefore only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism#cite_note-33"" rel=""nofollow"">[33]</a> Similarly, the proletariat will capture political power, abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production, therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie and ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into a new mode of production: communism. In between capitalism and communism there is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat"" rel=""nofollow"">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage"" rel=""nofollow"">universal suffrage</a>.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism#cite_note-34"" rel=""nofollow"">[34]</a> It is the defeat of the bourgeois state, but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production."

Critical of objectively unjust and oppressive authorities kiddo. You'll realize it when you're older
"Yet you defend the negative externalities of divorcing command from action. Critical? You probably don't even know what a negative externality is, and how it might stem from absentee ownership. Lmao, you're a joke. Libertarian, my ass."
haha you know more about that man than he does! i'm impressed! i bet you know his favorite food better than him too! what else can you read from his mind? ooh! do me next!!
Libertarians are supposed to be critical of authority
Not true. Libertarians are critical of one thing and one thing only: the initiation of force
"Probably need to flesh that out some more. That could mean all the things that infringe on our freedoms and individuality. Without force, those infringements have no power.... maybe idk"
So... you're saying libertarians are not supposed to be critical of authoritarianism? Smdh.
"Not all authority is authoritarian. Authoritarian governments violate the NAP and initiate force, that is what makes them bad. If the government didn't initiate force, it wouldn't be authoritarian in any way."
Not all authority is authoritarian.
Yeah almost like there's some critical thinking that goes into deciding legitimacy...
"If the government didn't initiate force, it wouldn't be authoritarian in any way."
Propaganda is still authoritarian and it's antithetical to Liberty it; deceives and manufactures consent where there should not be any consent.
"anyone with authority over another is ""authoritarian"" huh? its just as simple as that right?"
no nuance at all huh?
no wonder you think communism would work.
"I mean, your claim to property only exists in any tangible form because of state recognition and protection, so there's that."
Guns give tangible protection to your own property
Do you want to defend against all conceivable enemies? Is violence to be the only source of your ownership?
Because I could just wait outside the gate and snipe you when you go to the market.
"Yep. Sure do. And anyone with <em>more guns</em> than you can come and take your property. Sure, the state can do that now, but if the state didn’t guarantee your right to own the property, then literally anyone could come and take it if they have the power."
"Your personal guns vs the guns of your neighbors, police, wandering marauders, and the military, right?"
"I agree that property ownership relies on force and the threat of force. But since we would like to be able to sleep in peace, we allow the state to have a monopoly on violence."
When I think NAP I think violently murdering anyone that stands on a piece of land I like.
Isnt that not what the nap is for?
"Ownership requires government, otherwise it's simply possession."
So...
Can the government work for us or are we it’s bitch just because we formed it to recognize our property rights from each other?
"It's because after enacting the Articles of Confederation and stating the federal government was only going to tax states according to the price of land and not the value of the tangible property stored on or moved across it, Congress failed to appoint federal assessors to conduct appraisals. They never got around to appointing federal assessors until 1798, and needed to raise revenue before then to pay the debt from the revolutionary war, so they enacted the second and current constitution to give themselves the power to tax tangible property both directly and indirectly."
"Adam Smith said unproductive wealth should be taxed and invested in creating more equal opportunity, to create freeer markets."
What is an example of unproductive wealth? Stuffing it in one’s mattress?
Land value.
"Wealth consists of tangible products resulting from the combination of labor with land. ""Land-value"" is not wealth. It's a political advantage which allows one to extract wealth from others."
"Any wealth that isn't derived from productivity, owning shares in education for example, you are getting paid to do nothing while making education more expensive."
What does that mean? How does one own shares in education?
it was just an extreme example. 
"If there is for profit education and there are shareholders, education must get 7 percent compound interest more expensive every year. "
"So, share holders in education stocks are a good example of useless parasites that should be taxed."
"“... activities Smith would have described as being unproductive. Answering emails, eating, sleeping, finishing assignments, reading and exercising would all be considered unproductive labor. The effort spent doesn’t fix itself in an investment.”"
"None of those things involve profiting from others work while doing nothing, they aren't freeloading."
How does one profit from another’s work while doing nothing?
"Owning shares, renting out property."
"Owning shares and renting property is part of an efficient allocation of resources. This is not a useful application of Adam Smith if true. To get one’s mind around that thinking, although reasonable, one needs to see things as ownership by a state or collective rather than individuals. I start all models from a small collection of individuals taking care of themselves. They own private property and voluntarily cooperate with others to fund collective services. There is no state or collective to own anything. The state serves the individual and protects their property. The fact that I rent my acres of farm land at all, rather than just ignore it, is an efficient allocation of resources. This efficient allocation is possible by the invisible hand of self interest making sure said resource goes to the best use to the most people as measured by what they will pay for it. Efficient."
That concept of Adam Smith is something one would see in Marxism where it is assumed that a collective owns everything and we all serve a collective.
That isn't a valid example because those shares are created by human productivity.
"The people that create them are productive, taking a cut for doing nothing isn't."
"Under capitalism the people that create something owns it. The thing you are missing is that most often people borrow capital from others, and pays back in the form of giving away shares."
"The workers create the value of the shares, the people that own shares in oil stocks arent out drilling."
They lend their capital which the workers use to buy drills.
There is no need for it. For 100s of years we have provided education without them.
"If there is no need for capital, why do people keep borrowing it?"
"Adam Smith isn't a god. He had a lot of good ideas, but he had ideas that libertarians disagree with too."
Right wing libertarians are for what smith and libertarians were against.
"No, you're not ""renting"" it."
It's possible for it to be <em>siezed</em> to pay the taxes that you owe for government services related to protecting your property. 
"There's a difference. In one case, someone else owns it and controls it 100% of the time, no matter what you do, and you are just paying for the privilege of living on it."
"And in the other case, you own it and control it 100% of the time until and unless due process determines that it must be seized in order to pay your lawful debts. "
This would be no different if there were no government and private court systems had the power to seize property in order to enforce contracts.
"All that would change is your ability to hypothetically (for a short time, until someone stronger came along) opt out of that particular contract."
"To think like a writer of tax code is almost impossible for most of us. Many look through a prism of fairness, decency, or even just efficiency. A tax code simply considers <em>relative price elasticities</em>. A tax code does not consider <em>values</em> but functions like a con artist. How can I collect the most money? From places people are less likely to see it or less likely to care."
Yes.
"I’ve been thinking of the same thing. We’re technically renting our properties, mainly house and cars. If you stop paying rent (tax), you’re evicted. "
I love Constitution on paper. It’s a mess in practice.
"If you stop paying rent, you’re evicted. "
"Most libertarian support this. Stop paying rent - Landlord boots you. They only seem to struggle with it when they are the rentee to the state.  Then, horror, they suddenly have an issue with it."
All the normal arguments they apply even apply.
"Don't like that particular landlord policy, move."
don't like that particular policy or won't move. Negotiate with the landlord. This may require a large group since landlord is has more power then individual you.
"Etc, etc."
"If the landlord came to possess a certain piece of land by way of violent conquest, fraud, extortion, or other illegitimate means, libertarian principles would oppose his charging of ""rent"" for the right to occupy that particular space."
If the landlord came to possess a certain piece of land by way of violent conquest..
"So functionally all land then. Or do we get into the argument that because the state conquered it for you in the past, all sins are absolved?"
"I don't think espousing right libertarianism necessarily commits one to endorse actual claims to land (of the sort made by landlords), but rather the theoretical possibility of legitimate land ownership. It is an empirical matter whether any given landlord's claim actually holds up against Lockean/Nozickian principles (like you, I suspect most wouldn't)."
What is happening here? Am I seeing the actual acrobatics that collectivists use to look back far enough to justify the confiscation of all private property for the collective? Then... once owned by the collective it can be allocated by whatever the collective’s model is... etc etc. And why do we care? We care about this because so many people feel this way that if we don’t legitimize ownership of resources there will be revolution. It’s just haves and have not stuff. When those people get the resources they will have adopted them in a shitty system. We already have elements of a system that allows access to private property for everyone. When IQ factors and AI make ownership unfeasible as fewer jobs then can talk about the Universal Basic Income.  We are not there yet.
"If the landlord came to possess a certain piece of land by way of violent conquest, fraud, extortion, or other illegitimate means, libertarian principles would oppose his charging of ""rent"" for the right to occupy that particular space."
If that were true you'd oppose private property full stop since that's where it all came from and plenty ended up where it is
"I mean, a wage is a time preference payment for human capital... or in less jargonish terms; wages are just renting a human as an objectified means to a profiteering end. If you stop renting yourself, you don't survive."
You're compelled to buy (or at least pay for) services the state has a monopoly on.
"""your property""  "
How cute the property you got from the government that stole it from the Native Americans you think it's yours
When can an economic model put into consideration private property? Assume a Native American was given land by an evil whatever person. The Native American now owns private property. Now.... 
"I assume that Native American has all rights over that property. You, via your collective, would like to take which rights away from him based on what legitimacy exactly?"
What an incoherent mess of a comment.
"Also, which word didn’t you understand?"
word
That's not how incoherency works but I'm not surprised you didn't know that
You seriously didn’t understand what I was going for?
I mean not really dude sorry.
It was clearer in your follow up comment
What is the point? It gets frustrating to people that are mainly here to discuss theoretical systems when people conflate with some other issue. Can’t we just set up some dominos and see if they fall straight? Nope. We will talk about native Americans now. Why?
How are native Americans and how their land was taken not pertinent to a discussion about the legitimacy of private property?
When people talk about MUH PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DUH GUBMENT they are conveniently forgetting how state aggression have them those property rights to begin with.
There's a common thread of Libertarian ideals only applying to the specific Libertarian who believes them
"""Voluntarily"""
"Yes, you're just renting."
Why can’t we own property and then collaborate (government) to fund mutual services for our community? The dog should wag the tail. We made the government. Why does the tail now wag the dog? I know why practically. We didn’t write an air tight constitution to prevent it.
You seem to philosophically agree with people serving a government rather than vice versa. Why?
"No, I'm just observing reality. I hate it, but facts are facts. Don't pay your taxes and they'll take it from you. It's not yours if government can do that."
"I'm more concerned with income taxes than with property taxes, although the property tax is a form of double taxation."
Funny because something being legal or illegal is just that.
I think OP is saying that declaring it legal does not make it so.
Except it is legal in US law? International law is questionable but doesn't matter because they can't enforce it. The drone strike being legal or not isn't whats causing all the commotion.
"Did Congress authorize the use of force in this case, or are you saying the executive branch has unilateral authority to identify foreign officials as terrorists and kill them?  If the latter, could the president kill a head of state in the same way?"
"Did Congress authorize the use of force in this case, or are you saying the executive branch has unilateral authority to identify foreign officials as terrorists and kill them?"
"I don't think the State department broke any US law by designating his organization as a terrorist group. In terms of the drone strike it is apparently legal in US law for the president to order one if its a response to an ""imminent threat"" without caring about what congress says. "
"People can argue about what is an ""imminent threat"" and can it be demonstrated that there was an ""imminent threat"". But does that matter in the current setup? Even if it was completely illegal by US law, congress won't do anything and the justice department won't do anything. All of this is in the practical sense, I'm not trying to say the concepts of laws and separation of powers are pointless."
"If the latter, could the president kill a head of state in the same way?"
And thats the issue this brings up.
"Even if it was completely illegal by US law, congress won't do anything and the justice department won't do anything."
But nothing will spare the guilty the judgment of people on reddit.

"I'm not an expert, but I don't see the War Powers Act as giving the president the power to make military strikes at will until Congress stops him.  What's next?  Nuke Tehran? Pyongyang? Moscow?  Congressional power to declare war is pretty meaningless if the president can <strong>start</strong> a war with any country based on a decades old general law.  I would argue that such an interpretation is not Constitutionally valid, nor what Congress intended.  Furthermore, it's a really bad idea unless you effectively want an emperor."
I don’t necessarily agree with it but it’s why the executive has been able to do what they’ve been doing for 40 years.
"Even if we recognize the war powers act as legal, there is a separate question whether Trump has complied with the law.  I think killing a foreign general without any authorization from Congress to act against Iran is illegal.  (Seriously, how is killing a countries generals in a military strike not tantamount to declaring war?)  Perhaps someday the Supreme Court will provide a definitive answer, but in the meantime, I stand by my opinion.  The fact that other presidents have done illegal things doesn't change that."
It’s why we’re able to bomb foreign countries without approval.  
"And I believe the Supreme Court has refused to see it because it’s up to congress?  I’m not sure, I believe the link said they refused a case back in 2000."
Theoretically I’d say so. It’s the same AUMF we’ve been using since 2001. Congress continues to pass it every year. Basically whatever group they state wants to call terrorists we can bomb.
"There's a little more to it than that.  Where's the evidence of an ""imminent threat?""  If you think Congress can delegate so much power to the executive, and you want to take the White House's word that they complied with the law, then I understand why you think it's legal.  I do not."
Seems pretty cut and dry to me. It’s why we should be screaming at our reps but let’s just keep making memes!
Irrelevant. Perfidy is a war crime.
"""Foreign Official"" is a nice way of saying brutal murderer and hostile agent against the US. I get what ur saying but dont like let your distrust of the government blind you to reality, the man was an active enemy of America and the government was no less within reason to act as it did as any other drone strike on terrorism like it or not"
"I'm not disputing that he was a terrible person and a threat the US.  North Korea also has  a terrible government that is a threat to our people and our allies, but we can't just let the White House attack them at will.  If the president had gotten authorization for the strike from Congress, that's one thing, but the president acting alone is not the same as ""the government."""
"If a general in the north Korean army was actively arranging and funding attacks on the US then I would expect the same thing, trump was within his democratic mandate as leader of the US to kill the Iranian general as he was a direct threat to the US where a north Korean general at most would be a potential threat"
"North Korea has nuclear weapons FFS.  Your approach is naive and juvenile.  There's a reason the Constitution doesn't give one person the power to use the military as a private army to go around killing whoever he perceives as a threat.  If JFK thought like you, we'd be lucky to be alive.   The president is not an emperor."
"It's not that he was perceived as a threat he was actively hostile, I dont think america should be exploding anyone in sandy shitholes but killing the general was no different to the US killing any other terrorists other then it provicating Iran who is in no position to do anything all the provicating does is tell Iran that it cant consistently act against america without retaliation"
You don't seem to understand the nature of my objection.
Did Congress authorize the use of force in this case
"Yes.  Congress authorized broad use of force to kill terrorists back in like 2001.  They may not have specifically authorized this action, but Congress abdicated their responsibility 3 Presidents ago and Trump was acting within the framework Congress created."
If it violates the NAP it is immoral. I’m surprised to see so much talk of legality on a libertarian sub.
Two reasons.
"A lot of people are saying it wasn't legal.  Thus, the focus is on legality and not morality."
"Even operating from the assumption it was immoral, some people have noticed a far greater focus on this than on other drone strikes despite other ones being arguably more immoral.  Thus, there is some doubt as to if the claimed immorality of it is the actual issue people have with the action.  In effect, plenty of people are jaded to the point that they do not think others are engaging in honest discussions of issues.  It reminds me of the issue where people demand sources and citations but then cease a discussion once provided.  It indicates they didn't actually care, they were just using it as a tactic to waste the other sides time.  In response people care less about linking sources they know the other side will ignore and arguments devolve into name even quicker than before."

Identify those instances and distinguish them from any other military leader in the region.

"So, by that logic, Iran acted, and has acted, in self-defense according to the NAP in its response to the US."

Why? Most military leaders in the region also fall under the same category. Fuck all of these assholes. They deserve no right to their fucking lives. They steal the lives of others. This is against the NAP.

Yes. Fuck those guys. They also have violated the NAP. Why the fuck would it only apply to Iranians.

They deserve no right to their fucking lives. They steal the lives of others. This is against the NAP.

"So you agree with me, then."
"My entire response to OP is premised on the fact that the US violated the NAP, therefore simply designating Soleimani as a ""terrorist"" is irrelevant. If the US is the initial aggressor, the NAP is already violated. So where is the confusion with what I've said?"

"Like who, exactly? Sunni soldiers that also attack Shia Muslims and Iranians?"

It is ALSO against the NAP to kill these people without legitimate justification.
Them ordering the killing of innocents is against the NAP. Them killing innocents is against the NAP. Those are legitimate justifications.
"You cannot simply murder someone outright, without question because they violated the NAP against someone else at some point in time."
"Umm... if they actively killed many hundreds of people, then I think that certainly is them breaking the NAP is such a heinous way, that anybody should have free right to take their life, since these people obviously have no regard for the right to life of others."
That's what a trial is for.
"And then you decide to murder him after the trial. Your stupid statist way, is stupid. You need the governments permission to kill someone who got government permission to kill lots of innocents. fucking statists. "
"It's funny how you list a bunch of murdering assholes, and then pretened like they are not all fucked up and deserve to die."
You're a delusional fucking lunatic. Guess who killed Soleimani? IT WAS THE UNITED STATES. 
A STATE extrajudicially killed Soleimani. And you're sitting here applauding that.
You're not a libertarian.
I dont care who kills him though? He was free game.

He was directing non-Iranian groups to attack US assets in another country. Whether he had a title in Iran seems rather irrelevant. Also the attack in the US embassy was conducted with protesters mixed in with militants. So not something national military do. During WWII German soldiers who were captured wearing US uniforms were executed on the spot.

"You left out the most important part. ""And did it while not being the US government or US military, which makes it terrorism."""
I'm sure he snuck into Iraq so he could visit old folks in nursing homes and do charity upkeep work on homes for orphans (/s).
"Snuck into Iraq? He was part of the coalition fighting against ISIS there. You know, the same one you guys were in."
"You realize Qasim Soleimani and the US military fought side by side in Iraq? That US military command acknowledged that without Suleimani's support and the strength of his forces on the ground the coalition wouldn't have been able to defeat ISIS and take back Iraqi cities the way they did? General Dempsey said that without their support it would have all been a very different situation right now, and that a lot of those cities wouldn't have been recaptured. "
"What the US did was bomb them from the skies, Soleimani was the one leading the assault on the ground in many cases. "
"The group doing the fighting on the ground in Syria were the Kurds who the US abandoned to the slaughter. In Iraq, it was Suleimani and the Quds forces who the US has been indiscriminately bombing to pieces on civilian ground in an allied country (if one of <em>them</em> does something like it's called terrorism, luckily it's the US doing it so no probs)."

Kinda new to this.
I thought that this was under the guise of retaliation for the embassy riots.  Apparently this general had given the rioters the green light.

"No, the US military, Bush administration said there were WMDs in Iraq. So this is completely different. Also, is this new administration arguing for an invasion of Iran? Doesn't seem like it. So what's the same? "
"Whatever the deal is, I don't see any reason to get upset about a military guy getting wacked by another military. "
"All that said I think the US should close all overseas bases and bring all military personnel home. Also, only fight to defend US citizens and borders."
"And you have no idea what evidence the US had, what evidence the US military requires, etc. "
<em>That is the point</em> . We don't know the evidence and <em>will never be provided with the evidence</em> .
"Literally the same fucking playbook used to justify the Iraq invasion. Imminent attacks. WMDs, etc, etc. All BS."
"But I'm sure we can wholeheartedly trust the US intelligence community <em>this time</em> , right?"
"Whatever the deal is, I don't see any reason to get upset about a military guy getting wacked by another military. "
"That's a completely false characterization of how this is playing out in the media and general discourse. It's been labeled akin to the killing of Bagdadi, the leader of ISIS. That Soleimani is a terrorist leader of some kind. It's completely fucking wrong to assert that its merely labeled as ""one military leader kills another"". "
"See, the characterization of this event in the media and by the administration tells you <em>everything you need to know</em> . They are clearly lying about Soleimani's status and position, and yet you are perfectly willing to trust everything else about the situation."
"That makes you either a liar too, or a guillable moron."
That is the point . We don't know the evidence and will never be provided with the evidence .
So you don't have the evidence. You don't know if you'll see any evidence. 
Imminent attacks. WMDs
Two different things. And it seems likely this guy was directing attacks. 
"But I'm sure we can wholeheartedly trust the US intelligence community this time , right?"
"I don't support state employees at all. But again, why so concerned that this military guy got wacked? He's another state employee. "
That Soleimani is a terrorist leader of some kind.
Well there are years of articles from media around the globe detailing his different activities. Seems like a lot of evidence. 
"It's completely fucking wrong to assert that its merely labeled as ""one military leader kills another""."
"That's what it was, why so upset about it? "
They are clearly lying about Soleimani's status and position
And you determined this from the evidence you say you don't have?!
"That makes you either a liar too, or a guillable moron."
You're a bit strange.
So you don't have the evidence. You don't know if you'll see any evidence.
Yea. And neither do you. Meaning you're relying on complete faith.
Do I need to spoon feed it to you?
Two different things.
Wrong. The intelligence community is not substantially different. Try again.
And it seems likely this guy was directing attacks.
According to <em>WHAT EVIDENCE</em> ? You DO NOT HAVE IT.
"I don't support state employees at all. But again, why so concerned that this military guy got wacked? He's another state employee."
"Because it escalates a potential war with Iran, which does concern Americans very much."
Well there are years of articles from media around the globe detailing his different activities. Seems like a lot of evidence
<em>WOOOW</em> So media outlets owned and advertised by literal military contractors are good enough evidence for you?
So I'm guessing you still believe that Iraq had WMDs. There are mountains of garbage articles claiming that BS as well.
You're getting stupider by the second.
"That's what it was, why so upset about it?"
Liars like you will refuse to acknowledge that it this isn't WHAT IS REPORTED by the media and administration.
You're a bit strange.
You're a fucking liar and clearly don't care about BS propaganda that intends to have more innocent civilians and American soldiers killed.
Yea. And neither do you. Meaning you're relying on complete faith.
"I don't have faith at all, so the logical thing to do is just consider the situation one military kills a guy from another military. Done."
Do I fucking need to spoon feed it to you? Do you need to speak like a toddler for you to understand?
Calm down Francis. 
According to WHAT EVIDENCE 
"Many articles, statements from various governments. Take these as you will. Is there any evidence that he wasn't involved? I mean he was killed while travelling with the guy who ran the org/militia that conducted the attacks. "
Seems you're being a bit irrational. 
Because it escalates a potential war with Iran
"Escalates to potential war? What does that even mean? So it might increase the probability of a war, but the guy traveling with the militia leader doesn't support any argument he was involved. Seems you have really different standards here. "
So media outlets owned and advertised by literal military contractors are good enough evidence for you?
"Nope, it could be true info, it could be false. You asked for evidence this was one of many links from a web search. "
So I'm guessing you still believe that Iraq has WMDs.
Strange.
You're getting stupider by the second.
Deep breaths. 
Liars like you will refuse to acknowledge that it this isn't WHAT IS REPORTED by the media and administration.
"Liar? Based upon the information available, the huge amount written about the guy the past 10 years, my position is reasonable. But even if he wasn't involved with the embassy attacks, providing material, training to militias which create IEDs to attack US military personnel, wasn't involved in killing Iraqi protesters recently, what has be been doing as an Iranian general traveling throughout the M.E. the past 20 years? Charity work? "
You're a fucking liar.
Do you need a napkin?
"[Edit] Look, I think I agree with you about war, the US empire, etc. But I think the response to this action is the wrong hill to defend. Those in the media and the state who are criticizing this killing aren't doing so because they have an ethical issue or even a procedural compliant, imo, they're just vying to control power themselves or for their team to control the power."
The US should use this issue to leave the area asap. I wonder what new critiques would appear if Trump actually attempted to do this? It would be great if my guess that it would be fought tooth and nail were incorrect.
The Iraqi PM is saying that Soleimani was in Iraq to negotiate with the US. The Iraqi PM was supposed to mediate the negotiations.
If it violates the NAP it is immoral.
"Pithy, but I don't think that it addresses the fact that this man is known to have American's blood on his hands. He reputedly ordered and supervised combatants that literally killed American servicemen."
"Now, while we might both agree that our military shouldn't be anywhere overseas, the fact is that we do not allow the killing of American soldiers to go without some kind of response."
"This man was a know military leader in a foreign country. Military targets are never off limits. There is an old saying, ""Live by the sword, die by the sword."""
"Are we going to war like rn? Seeing ""troops being deployed"""
Luckily Soleimani had broken the NAP so many fucking times he doesn't even the pleasure of being 'protected' by it.
Trump: I am the senate!
If it was legal for Obama to kill an American citizen without due process then it’s likely legal for Trump to kill the head of a group designated as a terrorist organization.
Guess that’s what happens when you let both sides abuse power for decades on end.
Not that the bootlicker op actually cares about that.
When did Obama kill an American citizen? <em>Genuine inquiry; not trolling.</em>
Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011.
Thanks I'll check that out.
Anwar al-Awlaki
His 16 year old son was also killed. Also an American citizen killed in a separate air-strike.
So was his 8 year old daughter.
Killed by a Trump raid.
"Yep, 0 due process. Obama got the fucking Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 and then ordered the murder of two US citizens without due process two years later."
The 16 year old and the 8 year old were killed by Trump. Their dad was the one killed by Obama.
"edit: actually the 16 year old was also killed by Obama, not Trump. The 8 year old was killed by Trump.  Apparently I worship the government of a country I've never even been to, because I got that one wrong."
Fair enough. Both have violated our constitution
"And this is why you retards need to be booted from <a href=""/r/Libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/Libertarian</a>:"
"""Abdulrahman Anwar al-Awlaki was a 16-year-old American of Yemeni descent who was killed while eating dinner at an outdoor restaurant in Yemen by a drone airstrike <strong>ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama on 14 October 2011</strong>"
Bolded the part you seem to have misread because you're another bootlicking government cocksucker.
"Ah you're right, the 16 year old was killed by Obama, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawar_al-Awlaki"" rel=""nofollow"">the 8 year old was killed by Trump.</a> My mistake."
this is why you retards need to be booted
you're another bootlicking government cocksucker
"Jesus, calm down, no need for a fit. I got the details wrong about which administration killed which child, therefore I'm a bootlicking cocksucker? Of which government exactly, Obama's or Trump's? Because I have a longstanding history of criticizing both, and I'm not sure why you're so weirdly angry out of nowhere. "
"Whatever it is you're on, you're either taking way too much, or not enough."
"I <a href=""https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ekeq76/_/fdadfs4/?context=1"" rel=""nofollow"">JUST posted</a> a similar concern on <a href=""/r/Conservative"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/Conservative</a>. Ill probably get down voted to hell but I really dont like the idea of the government being able to hide the targets of operations behind the label of terrorist. We should all know exactly who we are fighting."
"The illegal act here isn’t necessarily about labels of terrorist. The war crime is perfidy. The Iraqi PM, during his speech to parliament to remove US forces from the country mentioned that he had invited Soleimani there at the request of the US who then had him assassinated. "
That’s the war crime.
Where is that published?
That the US requested they summon him?
"It's been published by a bunch of places. It was part of his speech before the vote to make the USA leave. I've seen it from multiple accounts on Twitter (incl. bluecheck journalists), and here's one in <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7854971/Soleimani-Iraq-discuss-escalating-tensions-Saudis-killed-PM-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;ito=1490"" rel=""nofollow"">the Daily Mail</a>."
"Here's a couple of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/janearraf/status/1213823941321592834"" rel=""nofollow"">people</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hxhassan/status/1213830321478737921"" rel=""nofollow"">tweeting</a> to confirm he stated as much."
Neither of those links says that.
"Given how extremist some Republicans are getting, I'm now have to serious entertain the idea that Trump designates the Democratic party a terrorist organization and orders the arrest of Pelosi and others."
He's already done something similar by labeling antifa a terrorist organization while simultaneously easing up on enforcement against right wing and white nationalist groups.
"Regardless of legality, few libertarians believe a preemptive strike is moral. If you want to argue that he's already been responsible for the deaths of Americans, I could accept it... except for the fact that he was open to such a strike for quite some time. This puts it squarely in the realm of a political move, which is immoral."
"I don't think saying that preemptive strikes are immoral is even a coherent position. If someone comes running at you with a knife, at what point do you strike? After being stabbed? All of those absolutes are not only nonsense, but immoral themselves."
"There are varying degrees, but there's also the difference between knowledge and Intel. If someone is running at me with a knife pointed at me, I would see that as a direct attack in progress, and respond according. If I've heard that Bob is angry at me and I see him on the street with crowbar, I'd be wary, but there are many non-aggression reasons for him to have it. If I hear Bob is made at me, so I get a sniper rifle and shoot him before he sees me, that's murder  (immoral)."
"Government has no knowledge, except for maybe first responders that happen to be on site during an attack. Instead it relies heavily on on Intel. Intel is at best second hand information, and often much further removed. Intel stated that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction which they planned to use on the US, and this Intel was used as the basis of our invasion. There have been varying reports about the accuracy of these weapons, and so we don't actually know if any of it was true, or merely bluster by a dictator to intimidate his neighbors. Thus a preemptive attack is based on hearsay, which is little different than me using the sniper rifle."
except for the fact that he was open to such a strike for quite some time. 
Do you think his latest actions were different than previous actions? 
"This puts it squarely in the realm of a political move, which is immoral."
How many military actions aren't politically motivated?
preemptive
You people keep using that word.
I don't think it means what you think it means.
"If he is a terrorist, by what means is any involved US general not also a terrorist? That's without mentioning the fact that the US has backed Al Qaeda and ISIS."

<em>republicans that think they are libertarians</em>
"What are you talking about? Just about every thread in this sub regarding intervention in the Middle East is against military action.

So much for a fair trial...
"Hostile foreign power? I must have missed it when the US declared war on Iran. Last I knew, the last time the US government constitutionally declared war was 1942."
"Hah we’ve never not been at war, but you’re right in that defining them as hostile is doublespeak."
This was a commissioned officer in the military service of a hostile foreign power who was covertly infiltrating territory under American control.  Either he was in his uniform and subject to the rules of engagement and a fair target or he was acting as a covert agent and would have ended up dead regardless because it's traditional hang enemy spies during military conflicts.
Either he was in his uniform and subject to the rules of engagement and a fair target or he was acting as a covert agent and would have ended up dead regardless because it's traditional hang enemy spies during military conflicts.
Neither is true.
"He was there because the Iraqi Prime Minister had scheduled a meeting with him that morning. Soleimani was delivering the Iranian response to the Saudi's initiative to diffuse tensions. Iraq is treated as ""neutral ground"" in that. "
"<a href=""https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/iraqi-pm-says-he-was-schedule-to-meet-with-soleimani-the-morning-he-was-killed-20200105"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/iraqi-pm-says-he-was-schedule-to-meet-with-soleimani-the-morning-he-was-killed-20200105</a>"
"""I was supposed to meet Soleimani at the morning the day he was killed, he came to deliver me a message from Iran responding to the message we delivered from Saudi to Iran"" the Iraqi PM said, highlighting that Soleimani was carrying a response from Iran to a Saudi initiative to diffuse tensions in the region. That came after Trump called the Iraqi PM and asked him to mediate."
"Well, you can't fault me for not know information that was printed an hour after my post.  Considering the cooperation Iraqi Shiites have provided Iran's covert forces I'm hesitant to trust the PM's version of events.  <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-05/iraq-parliament-expel-u-s-military-qassem-soleiman"" rel=""nofollow"">That this announcement was made during a vote of parliament that was boycotted by the Sunni and Kurdish representatives makes it all the more suspicious:</a>"
"Still, the session had a tortuous start with legislators struggling to achieve quorum even as Kurdish and Sunni lawmakers held back from joining."
"The vote was finally taken with 173 of the 329 Iraqi lawmakers, almost all of them from the Shiite sect."
"Maybe attempts to retain Iraq as a single state are futile, and the country should be divided between the Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish factions (the Kurds would probably appreciate having a legally recognized homeland again, anyway).  If Iraqi's Shia population wants to align with Iran, that's their business, and we should step aside and let them do it."
If the prime minister is telling the truth then you're right.  Baiting Soleimani to enter Iraq under the pretense of a legitimate invitation then killing him is definitely not kosher.
Either he was in his uniform and subject to the rules of engagement and a fair target or he was acting as a covert agent and would have ended up dead regardless because it's traditional hang enemy spies during military conflicts.
"That seems to be predicated on there being an open war between the US and Iran. And the whole discussion of ""why"" assumes that the important decisions were made by someone without dementia."
"You’re spreading misinformation. The war crime is perfidy. The Iraqi PM, during his speech to parliament to remove US forces from the country mentioned that he had invited Soleimani there at the request of the US who then had him assassinated. "
Perfidy is a war crime.
That is only for American citizens. The government isn’t obligated to afford the full rights of citizenship to everyone else.
"Edit: There’s a difference between human/natural rights, and constitutional rights. But, if I’m wrong I’m wrong."
Wrong. Rights come from the nature of being a human. They Government s doesn't afford them. It is only supposed to protect them.
"Murdering people is fine, so long as you don't share the same citizenship."
"Wasn’t murder, but yeah. An enemy combatant isn’t afforded the same rights as a citizen is."
Who decides who is and is not a combatant?
More or less our constitution. You’re ineligible to be an American citizen if you’re working for a foreign military. 
"So if you’re ineligible to be an American citizen, then you definitely aren’t one, and as such, aren’t given the same rights."
Go fuck yourself bootlicker.
Get this shit out of here. Don’t throw insults; it only makes you look like a child.
You are a shill and everyone knows.
It’s not even for citizens given the Obama killed an American citizen without due process.
Not that the Democrat boot licker op cares about that.
Well according to the due process clause of the 5th amendment is it by definition illegal.
The constitution applies to citizens...
"It specifically states ""no person"" not no citizen."
Lol.
"I can’t tell if you’re trying to be funny, or if you’re really that dumb."
"The Constitution and law is extremely specific about which laws apply to everyone and which ones apply to citizens. Laws that say ""no person"" are for all humans. If you might recall your history courses, the founding fathers of the US were very into things like ideals and rights, and not making sure that people who belonged to the same country as them were the only people who got any protections"
Go read the bill of rights.
The one that makes a distinction between persons and citizens? Am I supposed to learn something new there like how the founders decided to redefine person to mean citizen of the United States only and everyone else doesn't count as a person?
"It's funny how we waste our time in these countries when it isn't our fault they're so messed up in the first place, the real ""bad guys"" of these countries should be early 1900s France and Britain whom royally fu*ked over the Arabic state. We have no use being there the war in terror is a waste of money, time and lives I understand the want to help the people stuck in those countries but national diplomacy is truly our best option war gets as much done as diplomacy in these places (little to nothing) so why risk our citizens lives over something that although very sad, isn't out problem. The military should be a defense force not a terrorist kill squad because in actuality killing one terrorist just makes 2 more replace him."
America overthrew a democratically elected leader in Iran in the 70/80s leading to the current religious government. We definitely played a part here
"Oh we definitely did, but the start of the issues is due to the french and British, look up the Sykes-picot agreement it explains a lot of why the middle east is the way it is and how extremism through the sadiurabians came to be as prevalent."
"And the founding of Israel after WWII. The Arabic leaders involved agreed the Jews deserved a state after what happened, but asked a question, why there instead of cutting out part of Germany, the country that did it."
That obviously adds to it but it's all a domino effect and the start happens to be die to France and Britain.
"Debating legal when it comes to the president's action is like debating what size bucket to use to extinguish a volcano. Legal doesn't seem to be a priority here or any president for that matter. The issue now remains Iran response and thus, ours to that. All the rest is just commentary for 24 hour news."

"This guy doesn't have to be a terrorist.  He's not even close to a civilian; most drone strikes are bad, but he's not some innocent guy.  It's when people start droning civilians that's the big issue."
"No, high ranking foreign government officials are kinda a big issue."
"It's the sort of thing where, besides the moral issues, you open yourself up to those same sort of attacks."
"Bingo, we just declared open season on high ranking government officials, and made ours free game too. Pompeo is now considered a fair target for assassination, as both a former CIA director and now Secretary of State, he's about on par."
"Even better realization...When Democrats ignore Obama's warmongering in 7 countries for 8 years with multiple terrorist leaders taken down and then act ""concerned"" about the middle east when a White Republican is in office..."
Or when republicans act “concerned” about Obama drone strikes.
"Glad he's gone, just not crazy about how it was done. Can we agree on that?"
"I don't believe any Americans on US soil were in an danger, so there's not really a libertarian argument to assassinating a foreign leader here."

"There is nothing legal or moral about war in any sense.  There is no legal system in which killing, the main activity of war, is legal.  Also, there's no ethical field in which killing is considered moral."
To argue that legality or morality is even a consideration in war is just ignorant and unproductive.  
"Killers kill and killers end up getting killed, more often than not, by other killers ... that's war.  Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist, a person who was directly or indirectly responsible for countless deaths, and a willing participant in the actions of war.  He got himself killed by doing so ... there's no need for arguments of legality or morality.  "
"Every soldier knows the risk associated with participating in war, he would have gleefully killed as many of his perceived enemies as possible without thought or consideration of legality or morality.  Why should anyone else give a second thought to either on his behalf???  Answer: They shouldn't, fuck him."
Was he not a terrorist?
Please provide a definition of terrorism that does not simultaneously implicate the United States and Donald Trump as terrorist organizations or persons.
George Bush----total 100% terrorist.
How was he a terrorist
Anyone defending a terrorist general of a terrorist government that oppresses terrorized countries is an idiot in my book.
And yet i see quite a few people people here supporting the US ... i feel you pal.
"Lmao...get fucked Iranian shills, go suck goat dick"
"maybe unsubscribe from this sub, neocon chickenhawk PUSSY"
How many americans does the guy have to kill before it becomes morally acceptable to end the threat he creates via lethal force?
By that logic there's plenty of American government officials who deserve a drone strike or two.
And if the countries wishing to do so had the situation reversed they would do so.  But they don't because they know the US response if they tried.
"This touches on an issue that I don't think gets enough recognition.  At the highest level of human interaction (currently nation vs nation), might seems to be the dominating factor in deciding right and wrong.  Things like morals are only left to the victor to enforce.  No matter how much something violates your moral system, if you don't have the power to enforce it then you are at the whim of the moral system of the one with power, and oftentimes that moral system seems to be a nice coat of paint and sophism on top of ""heads I win, tails you lose""."
How many people do we have to kill before it's morally acceptable to end our threat with lethal force?
"The difference is that when we bomb someone, we do it in the name of Freedom. But when they do it, they use the Persian word for freedom so it doesn't count."
How many civilians has he killed?
Nowhere near as many as we have
Same guy also said twitter wasnt official executive information.
"Same guy also threatened war-crimes over Twitter, so now those are official communications too..."
Just add it to the impeachment pile I guess
"Standard Trump... He doesn't mean what he says, you need to understand Trumpism to understand Trump, but he tells it like it is."
So many hardcore leftists with Trump Derangement syndrome on this sub. Sad
"I remember when it was called ""Bush Derangement Syndrome"" when people were upset about the President starting a war."
"Well that clears up the whole ""you can't use twitter as evidence in my trial"" thing..."
Trump is literally the dumbest shit to be president
100%. Dumbest president so far. Hopefully he will be the dumbest of all time because if someone stupider than him somehow wins we'll go full blown circus.
Look at his adoring followers they’re just as if not dumber than he is.

"In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is a virtue signaling cuck, after all."
"There is still a bunch of Qultists in the tweets, that level of stupid is hard to grasp."
No. This was on purpose.

What was the outcome of that again?"

They attacked the embassy (as well as years and years of other attacks).  There is no legal issue here guys.  Sorry.  There is a well-established doctrine of “anticipatory self-defence” 
Step #1 of any strategy is to stop letting terrorist regimes attack us without repercussion.
Yeah it's not like the government uses false flags or anything like that to garner support for illegitimate conflicts.
"Yeah, we’ve <em>NEVER</em> done anything bad to them or anyone else in the region.  This is totally unprovoked!  I’m disgusted, frankly."
"I’m not meaning to utter absolutes here, but the dude is Undeniably responsible for heinous crimes against humanity."
"And sending a missile strike to every person responsible for heinous crimes against humanity, no matter what country they’re currently in, would only serve to entrench us further in incessant military involvement, lead to the death of more Americans, and cost further trillions of dollars."
"They killed our guys because we killed their guys because we killed their guys because they killed our guys, and on and on.  Remove us from the cycle as much as possible, don’t feed us further into it."
I agree with most non intervention principles.  But my main point was there was no legal issue.  I have to admit I am happy he is gone.  His crew has been shitty for so long and only getting stronger and more aggressive.  I do wish it could have been another country to have taken care of it.....
"While I agree in principle, I don't think leaving these people alone has proven to be a very effective way of making them stop attacking you."
"Neither is the way we’ve been doing things, evidently."
"I mean, there haven't been a major islamic terrorist attack in the US for like 4 years. So it seems to be working somewhat."
"Just out of curiosity, since Al-Quada seems to be making a comeback. What do you suggest the US should do if/when they start attacking the US directly again? Just hope they'll eventually grow tired of it and stop?"
Are the only two options “completely giving up trying to stop attacks” or “invading more countries and killing tens of thousands more civilians and American troops”?
"No, you can also try to take out specific targets without an invasion I suppose. Like, I don't know, maybe killing genocidal, high ranking Iranian generals. Although, perhaps it should be done a bit more covert."
If you have a better idea I'm open to suggestions.
"How was this guy ""genocidal""?"
They attacked the embassy

Why are mods <strong>stickying their opinion</strong> on popular posts <strong>and locking it</strong> so no one can reply?
I'm pretty sure the mod was just making a meme.

One of tge reasons why i left the Restaurant party was because of their history  of voter suppression
exposing crimes is illegal 
Why should the census count (and therefore assign house seats) to non citizens?  It clearly gives an unfair advantage to states that don’t enforce immigration law and obviously benefits democrats at the expense of other parties.
"Because that is what the constitution says. Also that many people live there and participate in the economy and all that, so it makes sense that they would have some sort of representation."
"And that's why they're gerrymandering, is it?"
Because that’s how it was drawn up by the founders. And they intentionally did it that way. But let’s make a deal to change it. Non citizens won’t be counted but partisan gerrymandering will be outlawed and the artificial cap on house seat lifted by repealing the reapportionment act of 1929. True proportional representation in the house for states. That’ll give California 11+ house seats as more house seats for other populous states as well.

"So far nothing much has really ""happened"" but what's your point?"
"There are tons of articles posted here and elsewhere, many politicians have been crying about something that hasn't happened yet, and people do believe laws have been passed."
OK. So FYI no laws have been passed and these are still allegations. So other than an opportunity for a meaningless downvote what is your point?
I'm pointing out manufactured outrage.
I would ask why but I'd obviously be wasting my time.
Non citizens maybe I’m okay with making sure they don’t mean harm.. but citizens? Like some dude went to Canada for a New Years fishing trip and now he can go to work on Monday because of where his parents lived when he was born? That’s some bullshit.
Wow Republicans acting as fucking fascist cunts. Vote libertarian not Republican
California has a jungle primary system. The libertarians could very well replace the Republicans here if they made an effort. The Republicans here are full on fucking crazy and disorganized.
"it is always reasonable to challenge the national entry of suspicious people regardless of their origins. the state's primary obligation is to defend its people from other people. given recent events, it is reasonable to suppose that people from iran (especially non-citizens) who are entering or re-entering this nation after the act of war committed by trump, should be subject to extra scrutiny. until the f.b.i and n.s.a goons start rounding up people from their houses et al, this is perfectly acceptable behavior in my opinion."
You see that this included American citizens right? How are their rights being protected?
Yeah - the (faulty) implication is that we have different levels of citizenship and if you're a Type B citizen you don't get the same constitutional protections.
"and if you're a Type Brown citizen you don't get the same constitutional protections.
Ftfy"
I mean... That's been the case in the US since our founding. The differentiation is money
"the people are not just u.s citizens. they are u.s citizens who were iranian citizens who were not in the country at the time of the attack and have attempted to enter directly after the attack. certainly, that is a reasonable precaution and not out of the question for any citizen who reenters the united states. it is many times more likely for retaliation to come in the coming days and if delaying entry to ex-pats while they are investigated is what it takes to increase the safety of the american citizens, then i fully support that. u.s citizenship entitles people within the united states to the protection of the government, reentry into the united states during what is essentially a period of new war should obviously be scrutinized."
Land of the free and home of the brave except when actually put to the test?
national entry of suspicious people regardless of their origins
Is it reasonable to detain all iranians and Iranian born American citizens entering the country because of their birthplace? Why are you talking about some shit that isn't the issue?
Their origins are relevant.
yes it is reasonable. it is far more likely that an iranian born citizen would be willing to act out at the death by an attack on an iranian. you may not understand it but it is empirically more likely.
"Oh yeah good point. Fuck reasonable suspicion of guilt and all that gay shit, we've got assumptions about marginal statistical differences in societal danger."
the threat is both apparent and significant enough for an investigation. their origins + timing of their entry = reasonable suspicion. that is all it should take to make dig a little deeper into their motivations and delay their entry. it's not like their being executed or tortured. were talking about a little paperwork to weed out potential retaliatory threats.
That’s not how reasonable suspicion works.
what is the definition of reasonable suspicion?
I think we should take it a step further and put all people of Iranian descent in one area so they can be easily monitored.
I want open borders cause that's libertarian.  We want globalization cause everyone is equal.
"So that's why so many of you are an embarrassment? Are you seriously saying you vote one way, simply because it may be a libertarian view rather than what makes sense &amp; is best for the citizens? Having open borders is a danger to all citizens. Too much of a risk for danger &amp; why would you want that? I agree that anyone should be able to enter our country, but there is no reason not to expect them to be able to do so in a legal fashion &amp; are good, law abiding people. I don't understand at all how anyone can argue against this."
How are regular people more dangerous than other regular people? Where people are born does not make them more dangerous than others. You watch too much propaganda.
So Somalis are as nice as canadians? Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit
Probably? Do you know any?
"Exactly! People trying to make a point so bad that you must be watching propaganda.......couldn't be expecting some common sense instead. I so wish this country was split in half &amp; they could have all their homeless &amp; aliens running around....it would be good because they could keep making programs for them &amp; just tax, tax, tax their few working people to death!"
"Serious question:  how do you know if someone is of Iranian descent?  The name could be Persian, Arab or could be Indian (a lot of Zoroastrians and Jews fled from Persia to India before Israel was founded).  Obviously depending on their background and lineage, they could look anywhere between Mediterranean/southern Italian to arab to lighter skinned Indian."
"Also, I don’t trust CAIR to be honest on this."
Passports have place of birth
Ever heard of passports and immigration records?
"These are American citizens. They could be 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation Americans. They would have no connection to Iran other than their skin being a little dark and a Iranian sounding name."
"Either way, American citizens should not be treated this way, ever. Iranian Americans should not have their loyalty questioned."
"When in doubt, pull the race card; I wouldn't trust a word from CAIR."
"Meanwhile we have Americans getting shot for not playing Simon Says, not wearing seatbelts, holding a cell phone, and walking around in their own home at night...and not a peep from the MSM. No one really gives a shit unless the TV tells them to. Today the TV says to be upset about Iran. Tomorrow, Orange Man will do something else bad and Iran will be forgotten until it suits the narrative."
"Didn't know ""Iranian"" was a race for one. "
"And two, infringing on anyones rights is terrible. Especially due to their heritage."
Nice dissembling
"Getting shot for not wearing seat belts, source?"
There's dashcam video (from cop) of shooting a man in a gas station and saying he pulled him over for not wearing a seatbelt. Can't recall any names but it's out there.
I wouldn't trust CAIR on this.
Good
I'm not sure I understand - do you think it's good for the American government to detain American citizens with no probable cause?
Haven't you heard? Fascism is good now.
Hmmm - perhaps it's time to start printing up some Chè styled Mussolini t-shirts!
I'm sure this won't harm our future efforts to start talks with hostile countries.  No way this could possibly backfire!
We will never convince another country to give up nuclear weapons research.
"Especially when they consider Libya, too."
Almost as “weird” as the US being surprised that Iran has pulled out of the Nuke deal.
Perfidy. It’s a war crime.
"And you know he was doing that, how exactly?"
you actually think that?
Attacking a civilian airport is also a war crime.
At some point you're just going to have to admit to yourself that your master is a criminal and a tyrant
except he was like 1 foot over the red line (or something similar based on what i read) 
"basically he'd JUST moved into an area outside the airport.. (i could be wrong, but thats the report i read yesterday)"
That really doesn't help his case.
"well, if we were NOT supposed to kill a terrorist (on the big terror list and everything) AT the air port, and we wait until he's just left..."
"also, he was not ""attacking a civilian airport"" - watch the video, the terrorist's suv, and only the terrorist's suv, explodes and thats it. air port is fine."
​
"seems to me like trumps doing everything to stay just inside of the rules... so TECHNICALLY, i think that negates the ""war crime"" part."
"besides, didnt obama drone strike an ACTUAL hospital? no one freaked out because it was a ""target AT the hospital"", the hospital was not THE target. (if i can remember, i was much less politically involved back then)"
"but imo, this is the same thing, except trump's move was a lot less riskier. less collateral damage"
Everybody freaked out. Did you forget? That was just another reason for the Mideast to hate us. I remember it all over the news for days and I remember thinking how absolutely fucked it was.
whataboutobama
so what? you got an argument or are you just gonna parrot what you see others say?
"so yea, what ABOUT obama? the mofo did some shitty shit and no one blinked an eye. trump is under the microscope for every decision he makes, there IS something to that. you dont get to just dismiss my argument with ""what about obama"" as if thats my entire point, you sidestepped everything else i said to back up my ""what about obama"" squawked out your fucking echo chamber trademark catchphrases you see others getting fat karma for, and assume'd you'd won. you aint won shit, tell me, how is me asking wtf its ok for obama to do and not trump a bad thing? you wont be able to answer because you're not capable of actually thinking for yourself. you're just another echo in your chamber."
if you fuckers didnt have double standards you'd have no standards at all.
debate me on the fucking issue at hand if you dare pussy.
"Your point is shit because you're apparently aware that Obama doing this is wrong, but also defending Trump."
whats your argument? that trump was wrong to do this? why? he was a terrorist. there was no collateral damage except for the terrorists fucking suv... unlike when obama killed something like more than 700 civilians in collateral damage over his 8 years.
"so tell me, why are you so worked up about trump killing this terrorist? why is it a problem for you? i suspect its because the msm is telling you to be upset. telling you ww3 is coming. telling you that trump is a war hawk, when the numbers show he's one of the least prone to use the military since probably nixon. so bring on your msm canned and packaged talking points. i'm ready and willing to bust them all the fuck up with some logic. lets go"
"i would argue that some of obama's targets were legit too. and applaud him when he managed to pull off a strike with no collateral damage, but that was not always the case with obama, and yes, i condemn his killing of innocents TO INCLUDE A YOUNG AMERICAN GIRL...."
"trump has killed zero innocents. but you're told its ""the same thing"" by msm and you just squawk that out over and over. you think msm is giving it to you straight?"
the top military general in charge of elite and covert combat units is sent for peace negotiations? am i the only one that finds that concept ridiculous? it would be like sending the top navy seal commander to negotiate peace. 🙄
He’s the top brass of the military. Who do you see sitting around negotiation and treaty tables? 
"Luring in a politician with peace talks and the killing them in bad faith is perfidy, a war crime. On top of the assassination itself. What the fuck were they thinking?"
"The attack was an a civilian airport, also a war crime"

War mongering boot licker. Let the state kill everyone it deems a terrorist? Ignoring the sovereignty of other states and risking escalation to war. Neocon ghoul.
"That’s for the downvote, and the gross mischaracterization. I don’t want war, I don’t think this is gonna be war. But you’ve revealed far more about yourself with your false assumptions than a proper argument ever could."
I don’t want war
Then riot and stop defending American imperialism
"Buzzword buzzword, riot, oh yes aren’t you just a treasure trove of good ideas and solutions."
"Edit Clarification: You’re suggestion of riots are a numb-nuts idea. Protest, demonstrations I could understand but rioting is no better. "
Mischaracterization of people and calling them warmonger’s and bootlickers ain’t gonna win you many favors. 
"I asked you a question above, and all you do is call names. 
You do realize that the intelligence community, who’s no fan of trump, are the ones that designated this guy a terrorist? That’s how we know there’s agreement about this guys future, I.e. he has none. He’s now dead, good riddance"
You say words but you say nothing.
"actually, he's right. you suggesting rioting and protests clearly shows that you're either young and naive, or you're just outright dumb.. tell me... which recent protest was it that changed a god damn thing?"
"even better. which protest EVER stopped a war or changed some foreign policy in some way... i'll wait, you clearly have all the answers. i know you'll get back to me"
Then riot and protest harder. Where is the massive civil disobedience? 
Americans in general are fine with this shit. That's the sorry truth.
"no don't fight! It won't work! Give up, give in to your apathy and join us on our fascist conquest to destabilise the word. It's the only way!"
"Protest, demonstrations I could understand but rioting is no better."
"Peaceful protests only work if the people in power care what you think, and that's not the case here. When the people in power basically tell you to eat cake, protesting is useless unless it's backed up by at least a credible threat of public violence. "
Those who make peaceful revolution impossible yadda yadda yadda.
I have seen people say he was pretty much in charge of everything military. Doesn’t seem too far out of the realm of possibility.
the top military general in charge of elite and covert combat units
"Let me guess -- you heard this from the same source that told you he was ""bad guy number one,"" and that his assassination was absolutely necessary to prevent an imminent attack on the U.S."
Or having Trump go to NK.
I’m sure he was. i bet it was one of many of his alibis. Just like it was hardly his only “appointments “ that day. 
"My point being, what’s the point of those tweets? As I see it, one thing doesn’t disprove another or vice versa."
Do you think the Iraqi PM is covering for Iran or something?
"On the contrary, I sure it’s true. Just as I’m sure he also had other motives, other engagements, nefarious ones for going to Iraq. I base this on the statistical history of his position and previous actions."
"I agree that's likely, however is that sufficient justification to the US to perform a strike on a foreign diplomatic official who had been invited for negotiations by the host country, without notifying the host country?"
That's a really big line to cross - diplomatic protections are supposed to be strong for a very good reason.
"Well, If the majority of the intelligence community believe and rank him as no.1 terrorist, then that’s the same as having a kill on sight order as far as I’m concerned. Otherwise that title means nothing. Let the punishment fit the crime. "
"Lastly, While the US is trying to help out in Iraq, Iraq is also trying to satisfy both major powers: US and Iran, I think I would have been foolish to contact the Iraqis before an attack as that would have ruined the operation. "
"Does that show distrust? Yes, is that uncalled for, imo no. Corruption is obvious, as is discontent. "
"Lastly, Remember that the US is authorized to make military actions on Iraqi soil, signed and accepted by the Iraqi democratic government. Yes, that includes without prior notice or so-called permission. "
"I agree wholly with your last statement, diplomatic protections have been broken, and that’s a slippery slope. On the other hand, the US have been preventing an ally (Israel) from assassinating him on at least one previous occasion. (Sorry is not sourcing this, I believe is pretty easy to find)"
"Totally agree. Hell, people in our own country were trying to warn the guy about getting blown up at the meeting from half a world away. Certainly someone in the Iraq infrastructure would have called off the meeting if they had known."
"Yeah, the PM of Iraq -- which fought a bloody and protracted war with Iran during the PM's lifetime -- is very publicly lying to the U.S. to cover for Iran.  Totally makes sense."
You do know Mahdi's history with Iran right? Your comment makes zero sense.
You don’t get it. This is the type of ammo the US needs so that when they do the false flag attack it looks plausible
It says nothing about the US “using” anyone to do anything...
I’m confused how you reached that conclusion.

Sweet Republicans are being more communist every day
communist
You mean authoritarian.  Sate ownership of the means of production has nothing to do with this.
The military is communist.
Are you... Joking? The military could not have a more rigid heirarchy.
"What!??  Is that really how you define communism?  By that definition, every corporation in the word with an org chart it communist.  People on the right throw that word around so much, it's lost meaning to them."
Uhh what? Did you read my comment and the previous comment back to back not realizing they were different comments? I was saying that a rigid organizational hierarchy would include the military from being communist. The military is about as far away from being a communist group as possible.
"They are a communist program.  How do you not see that.  State owned, that provides free healthcare, housing and college."
"State owned, that provides free healthcare, housing and college."

Ok then don't respond but seems like you support politicians that take my money for socialist programs. Dirty communist.

"It depends on probably cause, being a different race should qualify as a reason"
At least you've stopped even pretending to be Libertarian
"This has little to do with libertarianism, if you dont protect your freedom your just an anarchist."
The founding fathers saw this when they allow for 3 days of detention without charges. For any reason. *spelling.

We're just diabetic pawns of the fast food statists anyway.
Are you suggesting that our Soulless Lady of the Copper Top has no interest in our personal well being? For shame.

Thank you for this comment. Why the hell does OP make it a point to say that he’s white. No one gives a shit.

"Springer, is that you?"
LOL maaybe his identity has more to do with his libertarian ideals than actual philosophy does.
"Bro, do you have any idea how government works? If they draft black people, that's slavery. Only white people can be drafted. Asian too, I guess, but they're too busy being engineers or whatever."
"Edit: I love the amount of virtue signalling going on here. We get it, you're not racist. That should be the default, if you feel the need to go out of your way to prove how not racist you are, well...."
"Only an inbred, cousin-fucking, trailer trash retard would think this way.  I'm obviously joking, so if you get offended it's because you're a thin-skinned baby."

I'll try
Step 1: John Stuart Mills wrote in En Liberty: “It is not because men's desires are strong that they act ill; it is because their consciences are weak.” 
Step 2: Don't care
Step 3: Up-votes please!!!!!
That's the comment of the day!
You sly fox you
"Weird flex, but ok."
Good thing you told us you're white. Otherwise it doesn't matter at all why the hell did you write that?
"Because libertarianism for him is about his identity and feeling self-important.  Its not about government for him its about politics. Its not about philosophy to him its about rules and ruling.  He’s a white male, and he hopes you feel the same.  Hopes that he is not alone."
"The real question is why he did not also specify whether he was gay or transgender, as well as his income and possible disabilities."
Virtue signaling is bad. Lets not get into the habit of doing so
Then don’t join the military. You’re not going to be drafted.
"If you’ve already joined the military, you are obliged to follow lawful orders. You don’t get to decide what you will and won’t do."
Shhhhhhh. He’s being stunning and brave.
I’m still confused what his race had to do with anything.
Idk man. A White male posting on a libertarian board? Color me shocked.
And colour him white
Age too. Wtf OP?
I think that's referring to being within acceptable age of being drafted.
And also white
Don’t forget that he’s white.
In every war there has been a draft more white men have been drafted then black men! /s
"I mean, yeah. Technically that is the case. Poor people get drafted from all races, and there are a lot more white people. Even during Vietnam only 11% of the troops we sent there were black."
About 10 % of the population is black so is anyone shocked ?
Is it just me or does he look taller
You don’t get to decide what you will and won’t do.
Yes you do.
"Nuremberging from <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a>."
...you are obliged to follow lawful orders. You don’t get to decide what you will and won’t do.
"Wrong.  You <em>always</em> get to decide that.  You might be punished for the choice, but that's another matter, and it's another person or entity's choice to do the punishing, not yours.  If you're ordered to (help) murder your fellow human beings, you should damned well be breaking any orders and laws which tell you to do so.  Let the blood be on the hands of those willing to spill it.  There are no excuses which offload the guilt involved in pulling that trigger."
"What tipped me over from being a libertarian to an anarchist was realizing that not only do we get to decide what we will and won't do, we have to. Regardless of what orders you were given or what papers you signed, your actions are your own and responsibility for them cannot be abstracted away."
"That’s why orders have to be ethical, moral, and legal."
Double-double. Animal style. Large Coke. 
"My order is ethical, moral, legal, and delicious."
What do you do when the only ethical and moral order is an illegal one?
Then you would technically be in the right and should not face any UCMJ action assuming it was the only ethical and moral choice.
Who is to decide what is the ethical and moral choice though? A committee? I should have been clearer. My point was not meant about certain actions taken by a member of the current US military. Regimes change. It was more an idea that might be beneficial to have in the back of our minds when we find ourselves following orders for the sake of following orders.
"Sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. That’s fair enough."
"My fault, I could have been clearer from the outset."
What if the responsibility for your actions means you forfeit the right to decide what actions you must take?
"I suppose I mean that I don't think it's possible to forfeit that right. Even if you sign a paper saying you forfeit that ""right"", the responsibility remains. Either people are responsible and rational agents or they aren't. You can't have it both ways."
"Seems like a, ""are you powerful enough to create a rock you cant lift?"""
If someone is completely responsible and a rational agent he should be able to make the decision to trust in another person enough that he forfeits free will (to an extent)
"Thank you for being civil so far in this conversation. I appreciate it as it is apparently something hard to come by on Reddit nowadays. My point is that after you make that decision to trust in another person you are still responsible for your actions. Just because somebody else told you you have to kill somebody doesn't mean you don't have a choice in the matter. Of course there are consequences, but there are consequences for any choice."
"You obtain the maximum freedom for all  by letting freedom be curbed ONLY by respect for other people's freedom, but that restriction is necessary, even in an anarchy."
You do not have to follow orders that are war crimes
You do not have to follow any order.  Whether or not you are punished for doing so depends on the order.
I'm technically giving my life for possible war games just so I can have the oh so privilege of driving. Didn't we all agree to a draft when we accepted or drivers license?
Didn't we all agree to a draft when we accepted or drivers license?
"No, once you turn 18 you have 30 days to register.  It has nothing to do with driver's licenses as those are state instruments and Selective Service is a federal program."
Up to a godamn point let’s not forget.
Obligated to follow LAWFUL orders.
If they're unlawful you can do the polite version of telling the person in charge to get fucked.
When an libertarian upholds laws...
No wonder we dont take you american libertarians serious.
Dollars to donuts we will see a draft during the next administration. Sending young men to die overseas is the best way quell the increasing dissatisfaction with our government. It's a big reason why they started the draft during Vietnam. They managed to channel energies into ending the war rather than more genuine political change.
Did I miss something that somehow makes OP's race relevant to his statement? I understand the relevance of age and sex due to US draft eligibility.
"Its his White ‘privilege’ to resist, but since he is a Canadian its not like they ever figured out how to profit from a war."
savage
those canadians were fighting world war 2 a couple of years before the yankees joined the battle.
"As subjects of the Crown, but they were doing such a shit job America had to step in."
"Be careful guys, he’s a hero"
We should all thank OP for their potential future service. So brave.
"Cool, you don’t have to fight if you don’t want to, we have over two million voluntarily enlisted soldiers, they are more than enough for any conflict to come."
Right?  And I really don’t think there would be a draft needed in today’s type of warfare.  We don’t need hundreds of thousand of soldiers in trenches like world war 1.  Today’s warfare is technology based
dont jinx that shit
"Everyone seems to think this will result in a full fledged war and an actual draft, that is extremely unlikely. At worst it will be a prolonged remote conflicted consisting of drone strikes, technological espionage and economic sanctions."
"I doubt it would even be prolonged. US cruise missiles and bombers have much longer range than anti-ship batteries. Give it two weeks for the US to get air superiority, at which point it's over for Iran. Surrender or be destroyed kind of thing."
I doubt the US would even need a ground invasion.
"As a 47 year old white male who served in the military, but didn't fight in any war: Okay."
Don't join. They'll be fine without you.
"I know, right? I to am 47 and served during war time. I never once lifted a weapon against another person (or at all actually). I never even left our borders. The war happened, and I'm pretty sure they didn't miss my lack of participation in it."
Yeah. I joke that I'm a Gulf War <em>Era</em> veteran. Didn't see a whole lotta combat in San Diego. I saw the war...on TV.
I watched the last US Convoy leave Iraq on TV in 2010.
At the MWR. On a convoy. In Iraq.
Family still judges me for not trusting the news...
I saw the war...on TV.
"I was in college for the Gulf War, CNN was new, and Wolf Blitzer was bringing the news. It was awesome. Live footage of Tomahawk missiles flying past hotels! "
"Lately, it seems like the news channels are chasing the next war so they can re-live that high like an addict. And foreign policy has delivered..."
Happy cake day.
"I agree 100%. Let’s be real though, nobody is getting drafted, we have <em>multiples</em> of the minimum number of recruits necessary to avoid a draft."
"Edit: if you had not fear of being drafted already, then just ignore the second sentence :)"
Thanks for the copypasta
That’s super. Fly to Hong Kong and start fighting!
As a 37 year old white male who cares?
Just say you're trans lmao
"If you compare Iran today to Iran in the 70s, then it seems a bit like a fanatical tyrannical government. Iran used to have Coca Cola, rock and roll, and bikini girls and stuff; quintessential symbols of freedom."
Here's a little secret on how to win a war:
"Kill the other guy, don't get killed."
And no bullet ever made cares what color your skin is.
Well too be fair the government in Tehran is absolutely a tyrannical government
"I wouldn't give my life for any government, but it think we are in agreement that none of us would die for Republicans, democrats, or Trump."
"I think you're confused as to what a tyrannical government is. You're not being drafted. If you signed up, then you willingly consented to what conflicts the US enters into.  I'm no longer active duty, but had made my oath to do the same."
There are plenty of tyrannical governments you could go fight against right now.
Need clarification. Your home countries gov turned tyrannical or your home country fighting a foreign countries tyrannical gov?
"It's all just, you know, tyranny. &gt;waves hand vaguely around face&lt;"
Need clarification. Your home countries gov turned tyrannical or your home country fighting a foreign countries tyrannical gov?
"Technically I think the oath specifies ""enemies within"" too so you should have more loyalty for America rather than its federal government"
<strong>but I would gladly give my life fighting a tyrannical govt</strong>
"Fight the US government's foreign policy branch :). No one wants an invader telling them what to do. No one will believe in the US' ""Librations"" ever again after Iraq, Libya and Syria."
The only point you have to argue is organization vs. Opression. What alot of you compatriots have lost. Unless you are armchair anarchists who just like to rail against the interwebzbronywaifusphere?....
"What does your age, race, and sex have to do with that tho?"
"Agreed, but why do you state your race and gender?"
iran's government is tyrannical.
But Libertarians only care if it's the US govt. Everyone else can get fucked apparently.
"Yes, we live here, this is our country"
If everyone else wants to fight their own tyranny they're more than welcome to.
All your credibility went out the window when you wrote white male.
"Don't join any military, then. Especially American, as we are a military industrial complex gone amok."
Do it nerd. Commit a praxis. 
​
Also: You can become a minister with the church of your choice (easiest is the FSM) and be exempt from any draft under US law.
Lucky for you Iran is a tyrannical government. Say you look like a good fit for the military! Why don’t you sign right here.
I'm only giving my life to safe my close friends and family from immediate and severe harm.
"I originally read the title as ""but I would gladly give my life fighting for a tyrannical govt"" and I got very concerned."
"Not sure I would gladly die for anything.  I mean, I might die but pretty positive I would be a little reluctant."
What about fighting a fire? You’ve just been drafted to the Australian RFS. Report to the blue mountains at 0800
I'll surrender to which ever side has more guns.  Plz buy more guns.
You won’t do shit pal
"Iran just executed 1500 protesters. Look at Hong Kong. 
Trust the US Constitution"
I trust the constitution.  I dont trust those who are currently tasked to uphold it.
I am not super worried about this whole Iran thing. Their geography makes any invasion HIGHLY unlikely to succeed. Mountains man.
Tbh I would gladly sign up to serve my country if say it was WWII situation. The problem with America today is we lost our vision of what made us great. 
American troops fought Nazism and Japan's State Shinto that justified Japanese soldiers to rape Nanking. That would be worthy of death imo.
"Regardless of if you agree with any war at anytime, just please remember all those that serve our heroes. Everytime I bump into an Iraq vet, I say the same thing ""I disagreed fundamentally with the mission you were given. But I thank you for going and fighting for all of us."""
"Well, the Pentagon is closer than Teheran to your home, isn't it?<br/>
Or how do you define a tyrannical government? Only the ones the TV tells you, or all governments who opppress their citizens?"
Then do it
From time to time I think about Nathaniel Hale.  How his only regret was that he could only die for his country once.  And I wonder what he would think if he saw us today.  
He was 21
"“Give me liberty, or give me death.”"
Relax junior. you're in the 8th draft class by age. Odds are you can't pass a PT test or drug screening.  You can keep on enjoying your white privilege on your mom's couch.
Just remember posts like this when this sub claims not to play the race card and is 'against' identity politics.
"To be fair, all of the top comments are rightly tearing OP to shreds for that."
"lol settle down, you ain't gonna be fighting in no war"
"Good, because you’re never going to see any of the profit from this war, and Iran has a tyrannical government."
Step right this way.
I'll give my life to stop <em>my</em> government from being tyrannical but not some other nations.
Yeah! Fuck everyone else except America!
Sorry my man the military does not want you or your friends.
The only point you have to argue is organization vs. Opression. What alot of you compatriots have lost. Unless you are armchair anarchists who just like to rail against the interwebzbronywaifusphere?....

Okay
"News flash, you can start with the U.S. Government first."
"""Why not both!"""
-U.S. government.
So you are joining Iran to fight against the tyranny of US imperialism? O7
Iran is a tyrannical government.
Washington DC is that way.
"As a non-binary gender-queer jelly donut, I fervently oppose the compression that war injects its jelly-like hatred into the spongy membrane of our society. We cannot dough on being baked by our oppressors like this."
Its interesting how few people know Americas foreign policy is the reason Iran has the government they have today. They literally deposed the shaw who had basically a western culture there. Never mind those pesky details though MURICA
"Are you mildly retarted? The Shah (do you always spell phonetically), was a close friend of the West. The revolution kicked off in 1979 deposed the Shah."
Yes I am mildly retarded. Wanna fight about it!
WORLDSTAR!
Just say no to the draft; it is involuntary servitude.
All wars are for profit.
"According to many, now is the time to grab your rifle"
So you want to fight Iran <em>and</em> the USA?
The sky is falling
XxTURDxTACOxX...
I'll only fight in one hypothetical war. I'm such brave.
"All joking aside, can we all just admit how <em>stunning and brave</em> the OP is? "

I SCREAM SALTY TEARS AT OUR YOUNG BRAVE TROOP!
You're nuts if you think this is going to start WWIII.
People on the left have been saying Trump is owned by Putin.  Now they're saying Trump is starting a war with Russia?  Really?  Who else is going to defend Iran?  
There's no WWIII here.  There's no real war here.
"I agree that WWIII fear mongering is bullshit and not gonna happen, but that’s not to say war with Russia wouldn’t be beneficial to both sides. Have you read 1984? Iran is the perfect battleground for a proxy war to indefinitely fund the military industrial complex."
You’re not exactly wrong. A conflict with Iran would be very beneficial to Russia as oil prices would skyrocket leading to more demand for Russian gas and oil
"The age of drafts have ended. There will never be another draft. War’s are about how much money, intelligence resources, and technology you can throw at a conflict. Any need for manned personnel will be more than met by the willing. The fact that we don’t get congressional approval for War’s anymore supports this. The political capital required to declare War is less than what is needed to call for a draft."
Are you going to stand up to this government? Or where it's the line on tyranny?
"Oh good, another crazed militia member is born."
Dafuc does your skin color and gender have to do with it?
"Are you in the milk? If not then you are worried about something that isn’t going to happen. And if you are in the military, you made an obligation that should be honored."
You’re not going to be drafted.
Join a militia
Words are cheap
"What if ""fighting"" requires pacifism to be effective?"
"What if ""refuse"" means life in prison?"
"I do share your sentiment, but it is important to talk about the details. Escalating violence against those who hold a monopoly on it will not be effective imo. Pacifist methods such as labor strikes immediately effect <em>all</em> of those wielding power within a tyrannical govt, whereas violence would be significantly less likely to affect even a modest minority of the same group."
Then why haven't you started a revolution?
Every politician that encourages it or votes for it should be the front line.
"As a human bean, I refuse to die for a tyrannical government, but would gladly give my life and possessions to preserve 90% of liberty"
"Thank you for your service, may I please buy you a drink?"
"As a white man, I just came here to say that Epstein didn’t kill himself and that the left can’t meme and that most republicans and “conservatives” are RINOs. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Everybody stop identifying yourselves
"As a 47 year old asian transgender female, I’m offended"
"LMAO. You don't get credit for shit that you ""would"" do, kid."
"Really now. How do you, in your spot in the world, determine what is ""for profit"" and what isn't? It's actually an excuse, knowing all war would be ""for profit"" in your mind and that you will never have to risk your own death to fight the government."
Well played
"I feel like a statist posted this, in order to perpetuate the idea that libertarianism (which should be about leaving people alone, non-aggression, essentially) is actually just an alternative form of white identitarianism for the developmentally stunted male who is afraid of women."
Clearly the most important part of this post is that you are white.
Get this the hippie shit out of here
Let’s face it...you weren’t joining anyway and they probably wouldn’t let you in regardless.
As a 25 yo white male
Why tf does that matter?
No you wouldn't.
Kid just STFU with your retarded ass virtue signaling.
"You are a 25 yearold brainwashed lefty soyboy fatty, who has never even been in a real fist fight, and you're here talking like your some kind of brave/ morally superior person willing to die fighting against your own (righteous) government."
"You won't do fucking shit except hide in your parents basement playing video games and drinking mountain do, you Cheeto fingered pasty pussy."
Also you'd have to literally be a smooth brained NPC to call Trump tyrannical or authoritarian. People in the deepstate literally committed treason and crimes against him and he hasn't done shit to them despite overwhelming evidence. If he was actually authoritarian/ a tyrant you pussys wouldn't even dare talk so much shit.
There will be no conventional war with Iran and there will be no draft so just stfu and let the adults deal with Iran.
"I wish there were more people like you in charge.  Maybe one day they would get really upset over relatively nothing and rage-exterminate the rest of us like we were nothing.  Then we'd never have to listen to another one of you hormone jacked war-whores speak again ever, and you could have a great time raging and frothing until you bashed every last one another to a pulp.  You're an empty hate filled shill and if your parents were worth a damn you wouldn't speak to people like that"
He’s not entirely wrong though. The average 25 year old in 2020 is not fit to fight any sort of war. I’m 35 and my knees alone would probably make me ineligible. It is a virtue signaling post and the people eating it up are weird.
You should travel the globe then
As a early teen I would like to wait a couple years to fight in any war
"Listen here, Liz Warren, no, you may <em>not</em> rape my income with a knife."
OP is climate change real. Answer that and I'll read and respond to this article.
Humans likely have some impact on climate
So this is wrong too? Tech icarly this is so.ething I heard about billion dollar disasters
"Its right in that humans now live more and more in disaster areas, its wrong in that the disaster areas are expanding and the storms are getting worse. NOAA expects Katrina level storms to become a far more common feature based on current models."
Tldr: The studies suggesting increasing costs is misleading due to an arbitrary cutoff (billion dollar incidents) and ignores increased property values and population growth and urbanization. If you look at natural disasters damage as a percentage of gdp it's actually declining over the last few decades
you look at natural disasters damage as a percentage of gdp it's actually declining over the last few decades
Sounds like an argument in support of building regulations
"Don’t question the information handed to us about climate.  Do not dampen the frenzy. Thunberg the Great has spoken. The only viable solution is that we put an immediate end to all humans who convert oxygen to harmful, planet-warming CO2.  Please report to your extermination stations immediately."
We def got him now Impeach 45 (sound of dentures falling out)
Do libertarians typically prefer democrat or republican appointed judges?
"Trump: “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way."""
Reminder: 
Deliberately targeting cultural sites that do not have a military value is a war crime.
Killing people could be a war crime depending on a lot of factors but in general killing uniformed members of the armed forces during a war is not a war crime
"Torture is definitely a war crime, unless you call it something else like enhanced interrogation of course ;)"
Roadside bombs are definitely not a war crime
How can someone actually support the words coning out of this mans mouth.
Oh my fucking God it's so infuriating.
The guy is literally using kindergarten levels of morality ffs.
kindergarten levels of morality 
Nothing new for him.
Just speaking to his target audience in language they can understand
History repeats itself
"Jesus fuck, how is that a real quote from the President of the United States?"
"Well, clearly they're using the freedom and democracy we brought them incorrectly."
"Clearly this is bad news for Bernie. He should never ..wait, whats my talking point?"
That’s it. I refuse to vote for Hunter Biden.
Wait - Hunter Biden and a Counterfeiting Scheme for $156 Million?  Is this just a complete fabrication? Or is this something that still needs to be looked into?
Sounds like a lot of hot air.
That is probably 25 to many

I’ll go back active today if shit pops off
"Dude you've never served a day in your life, all you do is talk about video games and post to right-wing subs like T_D"
"You can try and stalk my life all you want, you don’t know me and no pacifist chickenshit is going to tell me what I have or haven’t done.  Judging by your attitude, you’d be the first one to dodge if there were a draft."
Lol. Triggered. 
He doesn't need to stalk your life. He can probably smell your cowardice like everyone else.
What you’re actually smelling is your own stench.
"In my experience you're a lot less motivated to go to war when you've already been to one, the only Soldiers I see that actually want to go are the guys straight out of AIT who don't know anything and feel insecure for not being a combat veteran."
So nothing about you whatsoever makes me think you've ever served a day in your life because everything you say sounds like you're talking about a video game
"Did I say I’ve been to war?  No, but keep assuming things, idiot.  I know plenty of others who’d come back for a purpose."
"I thought you said you'd ""go back active"". How were you active duty and never in a war if the US has been at war for almost 20 years?"
Interesting take. What’s your opinion on draft dodgers?
"I disagree with them, although Ali as a black man in the 60s gets more of a pass than President Trump, plus Ali's legacy as a warrior and a champion was undeniable because of all that he left in the ring."
Thank you for answering. Have a good one!

"LOL sure you would, but I guarantee your bone spurs would keep you from service.  But by all means, go sign up to any of the armed services."
Bone spurs?  Guarantee I’ll outrun and outlift your fat ass.  Not everyone you talk to on the internet is going to be like you.
LOL five bucks says you can’t make it up your mom’s basementstairs before the bone spurs start killing you.  Don’t hurt your finger slamming the downvote button and spilling the Mountain Dew all over your Big Mac

"You're right, I don't"
You’re making two key mistakes here:
"1a. Thank you for responding, firstly. I just wanted a place to air out my thoughts and put my ideas out in the marketplace, so to speak. I hope you'll listen to what I have to say once more and respond in kind. "
"1b. True, but that doesn't mean that the ideology has nothing to do with the children being born, or their success in creating children of their own. Christianity enshrines making a strong male/female pair and sticking together to raise that child with the same morals that the mother and father had.
Religion loses here because stronger philosophical minds have picked apart religion for what it is, a fantasy. But they failed to realize that there's a reason that fantasy was present.
A good ideology will equip children to be successful in life and procreation."
So are you a moral consequentialist?
I'll have to look up that school of thought. I guess maybe I am.
"Consequentialism is a form of utilitarianism. Basically it's the idea that morality is determined by its outcome. Often this gets shortened to ""the ends justify the means""."
"I suppose that I agree with that, but with the additional stipulation that the only end by which the means are justifiable is that humans survive and thrive as a species, otherwise you're just creating unnecessary pain and suffering."
At no point in your .....
Please go on.
"Jordan Peterson is a drug addict, dude. Maybe not the best guy to listen to if you're concerned with ""degeneracy"", whatever that means."
Fair but his ideology has nothing to do with that.
Maybe you should stop listening to Jordan Peterson
I disagree. Here we have two opinions that cancel out. What now?
Here are my fav pieces on JorPete: 
"Have you ever heard the phrase ""winding diatribe""? That's what Jordan Peterson does. Think critically and research who you're getting your information from instead of taking their word because you think they sound clever."
"<a href=""https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson</a>"
"Rationalwiki? Yeah no thanks I'd rather not be lectured at by a community of socialists why exactly they hate one guy's ideas. I care more about what <em>you</em> think, so I can respond to it. Why do <em>you</em> take issue with what Jordan Peterson says?"
"Yeah why read anything that contradicts your worldview. $50 says you love Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson, Steven Crowder and Candice Owens too"
"No, maybe, not really and no. And no it's not ""why read anything that contradicts your worldview,"" it's ""I'd rather not read propaganda that's written through the lens of an ideology I'm already familiar enough with""."
"If you don't read what the socialists have to say, then you will never understand what the socialists' argument really is, but more importantly, you will never truly understand WHY socialism is a bad idea."
So what if you read something that you might disagree with.  What are you afraid of?  That the socialist cooties will rub off on you?
Yes
lol
So you doubt your own critical thinking skills?
I was messing around.
Could you explain why you think rationalwiki is socialist and in your own words describe what socialism is
I'm guessing no you can't.
"Alright well you called my bluff on it being specifically socialist, I was being dismissive and I apologize to you. I promise that I'll look into it later and get back to you.
 I appreciate that you took the time to look at my post ."
Maybe you should stop randomly calling people words you don't understand when they question your sources.
"Yeah well to be fair I was already aware that RationalWiki was a propaganda mill. 
Now I get to make a suggestion to you: why don't you stop relying entirely on the opinions of others to inform your worldview? Why is it that instead of talking with me you simply linked a page to a blatantly biased ""wiki"" site."
"And another ""libertarian"" turns to good old fashioned fascism. Funny how easy that happens. "
"I also like how you believe the whole ""successful societies had religion"" correlation as causation but completely ignore that in the modern world shitty societies are extra religious while successful ones tend to be far more atheistic. "
Population growths are slowing down across the world. I wish they would slow down faster but that is not up to me. The only societies that are a danger to us are the ones that have the technology to be on equal footing with us. Numbers matter little in the modern world. And as soon as a country starts to develop their population growth drops rapidly. 
"USA is a nation of immigrants and we have plenty of evidence that shows that 1st generation immigrants have a lot of kids, 2nd generation more than average, 3rd and so on have as many kids as their social class peers. "
"If you really care about your success and the success of your people, invest into education and technology."
"I am not a libertarian by the way, I also understand that libertarians are just edgy teens justifying their inaction as something morally superior. That's why I believe in investing into the future as a society."
"Hey! I appreciate the thoughtful response, and I'll do my best to respond in kind. "
"Firstly I would like to take issue with your labeling my thoughts as ""facist"". While the state is a good candidate for enforcing this ideology, I don't believe necessarily that it specifically <em>needs</em> to be enforced. (Also I don't care about ""muh racial purity"" or imperialism)"
"If communism or socialism or facism or liberalism promotes the biological success of the species, then it has succeeded as an ideology. "
"I don't think that religion is infallible, I believe that religion is simply an outdated form of ideology, and the fact that it is so rigid and empirically incorrect is specifically why it leads to ""shitty societies"". But even that is subjective, because within our own short lifespan we can't know if it will turn out to be successful or not (though it's gotten us this far, so I don't think it's entirely useless)."
"All that stuff about immigrants is useless to me, I don't care about race, because it doesn't matter."
"And yes, I agree that education and tech is the way to ensure that the human species continues on."
"I don't really consider myself libertarian any more, I guess. Maybe moral utilitarian, focusing on the long game?"
"Except overpopulation is actually the greatest threat to our existence as a species. So by that logic these ideologies are leading to their extinction. Hell, Syrian civil war happened after a 5 year drought which combined with their population boom made a war for ever decreasing resources inevitable. "
"In fact, most projections about global warming state one thing: the highly populated regions will be fucked. Either from droughts and mass starvation. Or from plagues due to changing climate and new parasites and bacteria and viruses spreading where they usually would not have. Both obviously exacerbated by higher population density."
"Libertarians are idiots so that's fine. Utility is great but never forget that at the end of the day there is only race, the human race. Skin color is ethnicity and does not matter. So other people being successful hurts you very little."
This is the greatest mistake of xenophobes and racists. They think that success is a zero sum game. When in reality it is better for everyone to succeed. Libertarians get many things wrong but their support of free trade is the one redeeming quality of their ideology. And trade is not possible without participants being on roughly equal footing. 
"If you want to truly focus on the long game then you definitely need to look at which politician supports investment into science, education and infrastructure. There is a reason why USA, Europe and East Asia keep producing the latest innovations."
Well then overpopulation is the greatest threat to our species.
"I only believe that ideologies that ensure the long term success of the group are worthwhile, so if it causes harm to the group in the long term, it's bad. If too-high population density is detrimental to the human race, then it's bad."
"Yes, I agree with you! Race is something pointless to get hung up about, and I would encourage different ideologies, so that the most successful one could emerge."
"I'm talking about the long game here, as a method to look at the success of an ideology. "
"I suppose that I've got to do some reading of my own to determine whether the path we're on is one worth walking, though."
As someone who almost fell into the same trap as you did. Let me just tell you what helped me:
There is always evidence for a position. Never trust a person who has a position and now is seeking evidence to support. They will inevitably find it. 
"I am an atheist who hates religion but if you pay me, I could argue for why religion is amazing for hours without ever lying. This only makes my atheism stronger because I can agree with a person on a specific point while still disagreeing with them overall. "
"Read about common fallacies. For me, the ""appeal to moderation"" or ""golden mean"" fallacy was something I fell for several times. Learning about it was very useful in protecting myself in the future."
"Travel the world, if it is possible. As an immigrant it is funny to me when Americans freak out about certain things. It was especially amusing to me when I travelled to Europe right in the middle of the whole ""BROWN PEOPLE TAKING OVER EUROPE AND EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE"" hysteria. I was the brownest person around and only because I got a tan. And I have never felt as safe in USA as I did on the streets of Berlin and Paris. "
Look at what critics say about you. Communists had valid criticism for capitalists. Autocrats have valid criticism for democracy and so on. 
Follow the money. Always ask yourself: Who benefits? 
"Do not assume that you have all the answer. My arrogance has gotten me into trouble multiple times. That's why I have a philosophy of ""better to follow someone who tell me I am wrong rather than someone who tells me that I am right"". And also why I make sure that my hands are on my wallet when someone starts to suddenly compliment me. "
And do not be afraid to dismiss someone or something. Me included.
There is always evidence for a position. Never trust a person who has a position and now is seeking evidence to support. They will inevitably find it. 
"Agreed, and I don't assume that I'm always right, firstly. I'm also loathe to dismiss someone outright. Everyone's got another story to bring to the table."
As far as common fallacies? I'll look into it.
Thankfully I have the ability to visit a lot of other places and I'm going to be doing that as much as I can.
Thanks for the response!
"Being a ""procreationalist"" is totally consistent with libertarian thought, provided you don't want to use aggression to force people to procreate against their will.  Go right ahead and advocate for people having lots of babies.  "
"But if you do want to use aggression to force people to procreate, then that is decidedly not libertarian."
But it's not <em>just</em> advocating for people to have babies. I guess I'm not really specifically stating that it's a government's job to ensure this happens.
"I guess it's more like a philosophy about the success of an ideology, and I don't believe that libertarianism is the most successful ideology when I think about it over the long haul."
"AFAICT anyway, libertarianism is more about putting your trust and faith in individuals to decide what is best. Individuals will figure out a way to solve problems via voluntary action.  If you can persuade individuals, without force or coercion, that they should have more babies, then that is a SUCCESS of the libertarian philosophy.  Because you changed people's behavior without resorting to force."
"Not everyone will be persuaded by your sales pitch, and that is fine too.  You have to be willing to accept that.  If you can't accept that, and want to institute government aggression to FORCE people to have babies, then that is wrong and unlibertarian."
"I think what I mean here is more of a philosophy about which ideology that I should ascribe to. If it produces individuals best equipped to survive and procreate, then that is what is important. To me. Whether that means that libertarianism is the right choice or not depends on how societies that follow it's tenets survive, in my opinion/philosophy."
"What sense does it make to ""let everyone do what they want, if they're not hurting anyone"" if that kind of laissez faire approach leads to behavioral sinks like this?"
"I'm not sure that you understand what laissez-faire is. Laissez-faire was a radical political program which advocated abolition of private taxes collected by lords and churches, abolition of internal and external tariffs, abolition of serfdom and conscription of labor, and direct taxation of the privileges of landholders. This program was aimed to prevent public expenses such as infrastructure and social services to be funded from charges on poor workers, by instead requiring all public expenses to be funded by direct charges on the richest landholders. The idea that laissez-faire means doing nothing is propaganda spread by rich landholders which didn't like the classical economists talking about taxing them so much."
"Okay dude you just skipped entirely over the argument to take issue with my phrasing. Just imagine that in place of ""laissez-faire"" I had written ""totally lax"". Better? I just wanted to spice up the diction damn."
Where my fellow groypers at?
You have a hate boner for this kid. I can't imagine why someone with a wolf-furry avatar would be against him!  
"'Rational Outlaw', were you 14 when you thought of that name?"
Something about him makes me very uncomfortable. I can't quite put my finger on it.
He is an egomaniac and has many traits of a sociopath or cult leader. It is definitely unsettling.
"Nick Fuentes isn't a conservative. He's a progressive. When it comes to US conservatism, it was the ultimate goal of the founders and framers to eliminate slavery and to live as a singular people. The founders toasted to ""United we stand, divided we fall."" Dickinson wrote, "" join hand in hand, brave americans all."" Not brave white americans. Nationalism doesnt and never included race. Creating a country that preserves a man's right to free speech and guns andwanting to protect that country is nationalist, but nations are not a race."
"When people talk about progressivism, they only talk about the triggered fascists that hate white people. They dont talk about people wanting to progress into the removal of minorities. We were never a country of just white people. Hispanics were here as well as Black americans and Native Americans. I'm sorry, but the far right is the Libertarian's seat at the table of political discourse. Not this leftist jackass."
Nick Fuentes isn't a conservative. He's a progressive.
Lol
You're an idiot
"You're clearly imposing your own libertarian ideology on the Founding Fathers. I wouldn't classify most of the founders as conservative, since staying under the monarchy would have been the conservative position at that time, but they certainly wouldn't be modern day libertarians either. Just two obvious examples of the Founders white nationalism. "
"The Naturalization Act of 1790,  This article of legislation allowed an individual to apply for citizenship if they were a <strong>free white person, being of good character</strong>, and living in the United States for two years. Upon receiving the courts approval they took an oath of allegiance which was recorded. The individual's citizenship was also extended to any children under the age of 21, regardless of their birthplace. If the applicant had never been a U.S. resident the application was disregarded. "
The Constitution restricted voting was to free white men who owned property.
"You're clearly imposing your own libertarian ideology on the Founding Fathers. I wouldn't classify most of the founders as conservative,"
"The founders were progressive and libertarian. We are conserving their values, making us conservatives. They are called founding fathers for a reason. It looks like you dont understand the difference between a progressive and a conservative."
"he Naturalization Act of 1790, This article of legislation allowed an individual to apply for citizenship if they were a free white person, being of good character, and living in the United States for two years. Upon receiving the courts approval they took an oath of allegiance which was recorded."
"Completely ignoring the fact that even though they were against slavery, they needed the south to ratify the constitution. This reflects that as soon as the constitution was ratified, they started to abolish slavery immediately. Revisionist history at it's finest. Good job."
"Shifting a culture isnt immediate. It's a subtle act that requires finesse. You can revise history all you want, but the fact remains that you dont know as much as you think you do. Also, if it was meant for slavery, why did new territories under washington had slavery abolished from the start?"
The Constitution didnt really describe race until the 14th amendment intentionally to make room for the abolishment of slavery.

"Im on a 10 minute timer because of illiterate fascist retards like you, so you wont get another reply."
"You have fairy tale view of American history. I really think that anti-American Leftists have a more honest view of American history than conservatives and libertarians. Both sides accept modern liberal moral premises about universalism, multiculturalism, diversity, and egalitarianism. The difference is an anti-American Leftist looks at this nations history they see white nationalism, patriarchy, segregation, and racism and they are disgusted and hate it. Conservatives and libertarians hold the same premises as Leftists but want don't want to hate this country's history so they just tell themselves a fairy tale about it."
"The fact is even most of the anti-Slavery sentiment was motivated by what was in the best interest of working class whites. Working class whites didn't  want African slaves living among them and saw slaves as undercutting their wages. You see the same sentiment today towards non-white immigrants. Even Lincoln didn't view blacks as equal and was more interested in preserving the union. After the Civil War ended he wanted free slaves so he could deport them back to Africa, something that almost everybody glosses over."
"The history of this country, and most of the world is extremely right wing. White nationalism, or at least the sentiment that this country belongs to white Europeans has a long history in this country. The country was 90% white up until 1965 in which immigration laws were radically changed. Even when they did that they had to lie to the public about the demographic effects that the change. There were laws against miscegenation and interracial marriage in many states up until the 1960's when it took the Supreme Court to strike them down. In the early days of the Republic many states endorsed the death penalty for homosexual behavior. Even just recently same-sex marriage was put to a vote 32 times and voted down, including twice in California, one of the most liberal states in the union. In 2008 Obama and most of the Democratic Party opposed same sex marriage. It took the Supreme Court to foist it upon the nation in 2015."
<strong>You don't have to agree with the morality of the founders or this country's history. I certainly don't endorse slavery or killing homosexuals but you should be honest about this nation's history and what people in the past actually believed.</strong>
You have fairy tale view of American history. I really think that anti-American Leftists have a more honest view of American history than conservatives and libertarians.
That's a bold statement. Especially after I had already substantiated and sourced mine. You have a huge burden to prove.
"There were laws mostly made by democrats like jim crowe, sure. Slavery got abolished, but like I said, change isnt immediate, trying to push change leads to conflict as we learned from abraham lincoln. Then affirmative action further created the divide because now black people are being hired regardless of qualifications. It goes against the very system of meritocracy that conservatives push for."
"Even Lincoln didn't view blacks as equal and was more interested in preserving the union. After the Civil War ended he wanted free slaves so he could deport them back to Africa, something that almost everybody glosses over."
"This is where you discredit yourself. Slavery was a reason for the civil war. After the civil war, slaves were already free. He didnt want to deport them back to africa, but was wanting to take free slaves to other british colonies. "
I really dont have to continue on about how you are wrong. People look back and see white nationalism because people like you lie to them about it. Revisionist history at its finest.
You're an idiot

"Actually, Obama attempted to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons diplomatically, and without spilling more American blood in the Middle East. Whether his strategy in that endeavor was a wise one is up for debate but he was no doubt attempting to advance US interests in the region"
"But he's draining the swamp, right?"
Bullshit
"These idiots need to go read their Miranda rights again. ""Against you"""
"You are correct. We have 3 branches of government that are separate but equal. There is also such thing as separation of powers. The house majority leader, one half of one branch of the federal government, is not more powerful than the president, and the President is not legally obligated to bend to Nancy Pelosi’s every whim.The president can also challenge congressional subpoenas through the courts, the judicial branch being the 3rd separate but equal branch of the government, which is exactly what he’s doing."
"Liberals and leftists are upset because our education system failed to properly teach them civics, or they weren’t paying attention in class 🤷‍♂️"
I'm anti war but just to clarify in the event of war...
1) It would most likely be limited to an air campaign. Bomb Iran until it submits to whatever the US demands are. Cruise missiles and carrier aircraft greatly out range anti ship missile batteries. Iran could close the straight of hormez but that would just make enemies with a lot of the rest of the world (except Russia who would love to see oil prices rise).
"2) If the US did decide for regime change (it might, Iran's Theocracy govt is fucking awful) it would probably be more successful than in Iraq. Iran has a modern, educated population much of which is at odds with the religious govt. However the issue is if what the US govt wants for Iran is the kind of change the Iranian people want."
Again I'm anti war but Iran is a pretty shitty nation that has been causing a lot of trouble for a lot of nearby nations. If Iran is stupid enough to attack America they might give the war hawks in Washington exactly what they want.
It would most likely be limited to an air campaign. Bomb Iran until it submits to whatever the US demands are
"So basically Kosovo 2 electric boogaloo, except this time redfor has even <em>more</em> mountains, as well as advanced aa systems that can shoot cruise missiles, PGM's, and advanced stealth aircraft out of the sky."
Iran could close the straight of hormez but that would just make enemies with a lot of the rest of the world
Yeah the rest of the world will definitely blame the defensive nation in an unnecessary war for taking a necessary step for their defence. They definitely won't blame the us.
However the issue is if what the US govt wants for Iran is the kind of change the Iranian people want.
Hahaha are you high? Iranians don't want a us enforced regime change and they'll want it even less after they've had the shit bombed out of them.
Iran has some surface to air capability but not what you describe and certainly can’t stand up to a full-on attack by the US.
S300 batteries are the second most advanced SAM systems in the world and are capable of everything I mentioned with high success rates. Iran has 8 of them.
"I won’t quibble with you about it being “second best in the world”, but the s300 is the capability to which I was referring, and they can’t engage VLO targets. And defeating A2/AD is not one-dimensional."
"Syria has S300 and Russian deployed S400 and yet they weren’t able to protect Shayrat, or shoot down the jets that shot down their Fitter."
Yeah i might be wrong about it being second best. Its not like we have access to the detailed performance records of comparavle systems.
"All vlo aircraft are detectable by all radar systems, it's just a matter of how close they are and what profile they are presenting. VLO is much more effective against air based radars as it's easier to keep presenting a less visible profile, but with ground based systems they have a much easier time spotting the most visible profile they have (The one seen from directly below), not to mention the reduced weight and size restrictions of ground based radars that allows them to target smaller signatures. Add in the mountainous terrain and you have a very dangerous environment for aircraft unsupported by ground forces."
defeating A2/AD is not one-dimensional.
"It's pretty ridiculously hard without support from ground troops, just look at Kosovo."
"Syria has S300 and Russian deployed S400 and yet they weren’t able to protect Shayrat, or shoot down the jets that shot down their Fitter."
"The fighter was shot down before either system had been deployed, and the shayrat strike occurred on the other side of the country to the s400 deployment."
You’re almost there but missing some basic concepts.
Being able to detect is not at all the same thing as providing a weapon’s quality track.
"Mountainous terrain adds some wrinkles, but not a big deal to our 4++ and fifth gen platforms."
"By “pretty ridiculously hard” you mean almost 40,000 sorties, 2 loses, and 0 fatalities? Because that’s what Kosovo was..."
You’re right; I didn’t realize the fitter shootdown was prior to their deployment.
It would most likely be limited to an air campaign. Bomb Iran until it submits to whatever the US demands are.
"I’m sorry, but that won’t work. Iran is a large country with a full-fledged military. They have advanced anti-air missile defense systems supplied by Russia. In the event of any conflict with Iran, you can be your ass that Russia will be supplying more weapons and maybe even direct military assistance. "
"Furthermore, Tehran is not located near the Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean, so aircraft would have to traverse over a large area of Iranian territory to reach the Iranian capital."
"If the US is going for regime change, then the US 100% has to conduct a land invasion to assert authority and enforce regime change. "
"It’s also true that Iranians are educated and have somewhat disdain for their government. However, launching attacks like Trump has suggested would provide a catalyst to unify the country."
I don't think you fully understand how the US starts these kind of wars.
"Each US carrier group has between 200 and 1,000 long range cruise missiles as well as ~75 aircraft. Satellites maintain constant up to date targets so the moment war begins these missiles are going to be launched at hundreds of targets at first focusing on air defense and communication networks. Iran isn't a third world nation but it's not exactly able to withstand the full US navy for very long. Sure Iran's advanced air-defenses might shoot a few fighters down but it's not like that's enough to stop the assault. The goal wouldn't initially be to target Tehran at least not until the anti ship batteries are neutralized. Remember the US has 10 of these carrier groups so you could potentially see 2-3 of them swapping out with others for re-armament / replacing damaged equipment."
"Eventually air superiority would be achieved. This isn't an if, it's an inevitable when. Bombing runs of targets such as factories, communication centers, power plants, oil refineries, etc. At which point Iran can either surrender to the US demands or continue the fight which all but guarantees full economic destruction."
Again I do not think a land invasion would happen but if it did we'd just see gulf war or Iraq 2.0 where the land army gets decapitated by constant precision bombing strikes. Huge portions of the Iranian army would surrender just like in Iraq. Remember Iraq had one of the largest armies in the world yet was completely gutted with only a handful of coalition casualties. Iran really isn't any stronger militarily. 
"After a few months of bombings and military buildup the US would invade through a land route in Iraq. Don't say ""Iraq won't let the US do that""... what the fuck is Iraq going to do, say mean words? Start another war? If the US demands it Iraq will comply, even if in public they ""resist""."
"US troops would push to Tehran with minimal resistance. At this point pretty much all major defensive positions, airports, bases, and so on have been bombed by precision weapons. I doubt there would be any major resistance besides perhaps the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or some similar elite groups."
Tehran would fall and from that point idk. How smoothly the new government sets up depends on how much the US learned from Iraq / Vietnam previously. The new government has to have the people's views in mind while still aligning with US interests. Maybe that will work out in the long term. Iran has a lot of people who aren't happy with the current Theocracy. Or maybe it would be Iraq 2.0. Who knowwwwws.
"But it 100% wouldn't be a meat grinder. Literally any war involving the US vs a non western or Russia / China nation ends the same. The US bombs it into submission, then sends troops in to face limited resistance."
"You can’t win a war on air superiority alone. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz"" rel=""nofollow"">The Blitz</a> is a well-known example of this. "
"I mean, look at ISIS. We tried bombing them into oblivion and it just doesn’t work. We had to get our hands dirty and train Kurds and arm militias to do ground fighting. We even had special forces on the ground in some instances fighting alongside these allies. If we don’t have someone else going in on the ground, we’ll be doing it ourselves."
"Do I think there’s any scenario where Iranian forces would beat US forces? No. But it will require a lot of resources, a lot of manpower, and a lot of wasted goodwill in the Middle East. These conflicts are terror organization’s wet dream in terms of propaganda for recruitment."
But it 100% wouldn't be a meat grinder. Literally any war involving the US vs a non western or Russia / China nation ends the same.
"If Iran has any substantial backing from Russia or China, our casualties will likely be significantly more than in the Invasion of Iraq."
"<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"" rel=""nofollow"">Korean War</a>: 36,500 dead - 103,000 wounded - 8,000 MIA"
"<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War"" rel=""nofollow"">Vietnam War</a>: 58,000 dead - 303,000 wounded"
"Compare that to the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War"" rel=""nofollow"">Iraq War</a> and the 4,500 killed. If we have any kind of proxy war like previously, things will be a whole lot worse than anything we’ve seen since Vietnam. "
"If we go to war, we will 100% have to invade with land forces and they will have to be committed long term to provide security for any newly established regime, just like in Iraq and Afghanistan. If we’re facing Russia/China too, it’ll be a crapshoot. I’d estimate we’d see 15,000-20,000 killed over a 10-year period. "
"For reference, we’ve lost ~7,000 between Iraq and Afghanistan. Iran has a population of Iraq + Afghanistan combined and then some. And that’s spread out over an area twice the size of Texas. I’m expecting that we will see a lot of extremist groups and resistance fighters popping up because that’s a lot of land to cover."
You can’t win a war on air superiority alone. The Blitz is a well-known example of this.
"WW2 air strikes were grossly inaccurate compared to precision laser and GPS guided bombing of today. Yes you can't ""win a war"" but you can make a modern nation answer the question of what's worse. Giving up nuclear ambitions (+whatever the fuck the US wants) or see every economic and military center in the nation bombed out. The US doesn't need to invade and occupy Iran to win. It doesn't want to, for all the reasons you said."
"I mean, look at ISIS. We tried bombing them into oblivion and it just doesn’t work. We had to get our hands dirty and train Kurds and arm militias to do ground fighting. We even had special forces on the ground in some instances fighting alongside these allies. If we don’t have someone else going in on the ground, we’ll be doing it ourselves."
"ISIS was an insurgent force without industries to bomb. We weren't making demands, our goal was their total extermination. No negotiation, they were going to be destroyed. Yes ground forces is needed if your goal is to take land."
"Do I think there’s any scenario where Iranian forces would beat US forces? No. But it will require a lot of resources, a lot of manpower, and a lot of wasted goodwill in the Middle East. These conflicts are terror organization’s wet dream in terms of propaganda for recruitment."
"Agreed. I am anti war, just arguing for argument's sake."
"If Iran has any substantial backing from Russia or China, our casualties will likely be significantly more than in the Invasion of Iraq."
"In terms of materials shipped over, unlikely. They lack the logistics to transport the armies required to slow a US ground force."
"Korean War: 36,500 dead - 103,000 wounded - 8,000 MIA"
"A literal full scale war against China, vs a nation bordering China. China can't just walk a million troops into Iran."
"Vietnam War: 58,000 dead - 303,000 wounded"
"We couldn't enter North Vietnam to stop the flow of arms and forces without fear of starting a war with the Soviets. Vietcong moved freely through ""neutral"" Laos and Cambodia so we never could really pin them down in a decisive strike. We weren't just fighting the north, we were fighting the south. The US installed an unpopular government in South Vietnam before the French left. We weren't fighting on behalf of some imaginary south Vietnamese army, we were occupying half of a nation that didn't want us there."
Important to note is Vietnam was an occupation. Iran would not have to be occupied.
"If we go to war, we will 100% have to invade with land forces and they will have to be committed long term to provide security for any newly established regime, just like in Iraq and Afghanistan. If we’re facing Russia/China too, it’ll be a crapshoot. I’d estimate we’d see 15,000-20,000 killed over a 10-year period."
"Why would we have to invade. If we invade the Iranian ruling class is getting kicked out of power and maybe even executed. If the option to ""cease whatever the US says is bad"" they would all but certainly take the offer of a cease fire rather than giving up power and risking ending up in front of a firing squad."
"Again the goal of the war would be (probably) to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions, and end their support of anti-US foreign fighters. I don't know why people think Iran's monarchy would fight to the death. The US's goal wouldn't be a regime change. Clearly they have experienced this over the past 20 years and don't want to start again."
"If the option to ""cease whatever the US says is bad"" they would all but certainly take the offer of a cease fire."
"The US isn’t the only country with pride and patriotism. It’s not always what the US says, goes. "
"Again the goal of the war would be (probably) to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions, and end their support of anti-US foreign fighters."
"This is an extremely nebulous goal, especially concerning proxy groups like Hezbollah. These kind of goals can almost 100% be achieved via regime change. If we go in, bomb the fuck out of Iran, and then ask the to stop developing nukes, they have 0 incentive to do so. "
"What, are we goi g to take their word for it, like we’ve down in North Korea? It won’t work. They will continue development <em>because</em> we’ve attacked them. Nuclear weapons is a surefire deterrent and the Iranians will be desperately looking to have a deterrent for the future."
"The same goes for their proxies. We’re just supposed to take their word for it? The whole point of Trump’s antics is because he says we <em>can’t</em> trust Iran’s word. That’s why we pulled out of the nuclear deal, according to Trump."
"Vietcong moved freely through ""neutral"" Laos and Cambodia so we never could really pin them down in a decisive strike."
"You’re right, it would be hard for China to send any reinforcements. But you’re forgetting about Russia. They are the likely supporter here. After all, Russia shares a maritime border with Iran via the Caspian Sea. The <em>last</em> thing Russia wants is another US ally bordering them. "
"On that vein, Russia can easily move weapons and troops into Iran via the Caspian Sea or via the Caucuses."
Why would we have to invade. If we invade the Iranian ruling class is getting kicked out of power and maybe even executed.
"If Iran submits easily after an air campaign, do you think that ruling class will make it? They’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t. It’s hard to say what would occur, but Iranians are a proud people."
"The US isn’t the only country with pride and patriotism. It’s not always what the US says, goes. This is an extremely nebulous goal, especially concerning proxy groups like Hezbollah. These kind of goals can almost 100% be achieved via regime change. If we go in, bomb the fuck out of Iran, and then ask the to stop developing nukes, they have 0 incentive to do so."
They have plenty of incentive to do what we say if we are currently bombing them into a third world nation.
"What, are we goi g to take their word for it, like we’ve down in North Korea? It won’t work. They will continue development because we’ve attacked them. Nuclear weapons is a surefire deterrent and the Iranians will be desperately looking to have a deterrent for the future."
"We never bombed North Korea into submission, though if we did we probably would go for regime change to unite the Korean peninsula and to free the NK people from a life of starvation and slavery."
"Edit: I mean outside of the Korean war lol. But say, in the 90s if Bill Clinton decided it was time for military action there's not much NK could do besides hope China would be willing to start WW3 over them."
"You’re right, it would be hard for China to send any reinforcements. But you’re forgetting about Russia. They are the likely supporter here. After all, Russia shares a maritime border with Iran via the Caspian Sea. The last thing Russia wants is another US ally bordering them. On that vein, Russia can easily move weapons and troops into Iran via the Caspian Sea or via the Caucuses."
"Who cares, that doesn't change the fact that Iran is getting smashed by 200 bomber sorties a day and has lost complete air superiority within a week. No doubt Russia has already sent over arms to Iran but it's not going to change the fact that <em>eventually</em> commander and control elements and radar stations are going to be bombed to the point that organized air defense if difficult. Also Russia isn't going to transport much over 640 miles of sea of a few hundred miles of mountain roads."
"If Iran submits easily after an air campaign, do you think that ruling class will make it? They’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t. It’s hard to say what would occur, but Iranians are a proud people."
This is a very good question. If the Iranian people legitimately rise up against the weakened Theocracy I could see the US assisting at least in some way.
I think war is very unlikely so I'm not sure if the US would actually invade via land or just attack via air. If popular elements of the Iranian people actually would support a US regime change I imagine the US might go in via land. I'm sure the answer to that lies within some secret CIA documents somewhere that neither of us have access to.
I'm just hopeful the US won't cause Iraq 2.0 but you know. 'Murica and all.
"Hi, I'm American and against war with Iran."
Thank you brother. I dont know what kind of people it is that eat up all the warmongering the US gov feeds them but im glad the ever growing libertian community is not one of them.
"Most Americans are against a war with Iran, for some reason our laws allow one guy to choose to take out a foreign military officer without authorization from Congress, which is why we’re even talking about this."
"HOPEFULLY, Iran will use this opportunity to look like the bigger man and try to de-escalate.... but since Iran is an ideological dictatorship and both our countries seem to be in a D*** measuring contest, that’s probably not going to be what happens."
"Also I have no sadness over the death of Soleimani given that he is responsible for some horrible things, however I think it’s telling that George Bush (a man whose not exactly known to avoid meaningless wars) decided that taking Soleimani out was too risky, but somehow Trump came to the opposite decision."
They are the same kind of people that eat up the Iranian war mongering: regular people.
The most terrifying people of all.
Yes. Also our brothers.  It is our job to sell them peace and freedom.
That sounds <em>hard</em>.  Can’t I just treat them like they’re less than human? :(
"Yes, absolutely.  That is actually the more popular option.  But it has certain negative unintended consequences, so I would encourage you to read the label carefully before you ingest that."
If we end up in a war with Iran it's only going to hurt Trump's chances of being reelected. I think it would actually cost him the election if the democrats had stronger candidates. No sane person wants a war with Iran. 
My suggestion to Iran is to take out John Bolton and then start negotiating.
K
The US isn’t trying to go to war with Iran it’s Iran that is further escalating things by threatening the US and if they force US troops out of Iraq like they are saying then that will lost likely result in isis coming back.
"STOP HITTING YOURSELF, BULLY"
The US had no right to bomb a sovereign nations airport without approval! I do not know if this is true so take it with a grain of salt but i read that the US asked iraq to bring Solemani to have talks with him wich would make this infinitly worse and now the president is stooping to their level and threatning with war crimes.
"First of all considering soleimani was the worlds no1 terrorist, has killed over 600+ Americans, attacked a US embassy and taunted the US saying “You’re not going to do anything about it”, and he even attacked US oil tankers and shot down some of our drones considering all this he was lucky he wasn’t killed sooner. And the US tried to be diplomatic with soleimani but it was clear that he wanted war and in order to avoid it we assassinated him. I have no clue what your defining as President Trump threatening with war crimes seeing as how he has not done anything of the sort."
He wrote on twitter that he was going to bomb 52 sites culturally important to Iran if they try anything which is a clear violation of international law.
So your saying that if a country attacks another country unjustly the country that was attacked can’t fight back? No where in international law does it say that.
worlds no1 terrorist
"Lmao yet this is the first time you, any redcap, or seemingly Donald trump has heard of him"
"No we’ve definitely heard of him since he has raided our embassy, killed 600+ Americans, tortured thousands of Americans and his own people, attacked our oil tankers and drones, need I say more?"
"since he has raided our embassy,"
And where's your proof of this? :)
"killed 600+ Americans,"
Foreign invaders*
"his own people,"
As if you give a shit. Want to target xi jigping too? :)
"attacked our oil tankers and drones, "
Maybe stop violating their sovereignty
need I say more?
"Please proceed, redcap"
“And where's your proof of this? :)”
There is video evidence and he even admitted to it
“Foreign invaders*”
*soldiers legally stationed there to protect them from terrorism and civilians
"“As if you give a shit. Want to target co jigping too? :)” 
So let me get this right you believe it’s ok for innocent people to be tortured and for gays to be killed for being gay? Looks like your the one who doesn’t give a shit."
“Maybe stop violating their sovereignty”
The tankers were from japan and had nothing to do with them they were just mad because we backed out of the nuclear deal.
Let me remind you that your trying to defend one of the worst countries that is full of terrorists and tortures and kills it’s own people because they revolt against their unjust and corrupt government or because they are gay etc.
There is video evidence and he even admitted to it
So... Show me
soldiers legally stationed there to protect them from terrorism and civilians
"Yes, foreign invaders. You seem to agree with me."
So let me get this right you believe it’s ok for innocent people to be tortured and for gays to be killed for being gay? Looks like your the one who doesn’t give a shit.
I notice you dodged the question redcap.
"Yes or no, should trump target xi jingping with a drone? He kills his own people - I thought you said you cared!"
You werent lying were you?
The tankers were from japan and had nothing to do with them they were just mad because we backed out of the nuclear deal.
I.e violated their sovereignty.
Let me remind you that your trying to defend one of the worst countries that is full of terrorists and tortures and kills it’s own people because they revolt against their unjust and corrupt government or because they are gay etc.

Why do you love war and war crimes? You even admitted you do
"“So... Show me” 
It’s called look it up soleimanu even said that he did it on Twitter and said the US won’t do anything about it well he was definitely wrong wasn’t he."
"“Yes, foreign invaders. You seem to agree with me.”
Do you not know what protect means?"
"“I notice you dodged the question redcap.”
It’s not relevant"
"“Yes or no, should trump target xi jingping with a drone? He kills his own people - I thought you said you cared!”"
"Xi jingling isn’t a terrorist and he hasn’t raided a US embassy or killed 600+ Americans or threatened America with terrorist attacks so it would be unjust to kill him when he hasn’t attacked America, also why are you going off topic and talking about trump it’s almost as though you don’t want to admit soleimani was a terrorist."
“I.e violated their sovereignty.”
Backing out of a nuclear deal has nothing to do with violating sovereignty.
“Why do you love war and war crimes? You even admitted you do”
"Where because I clearly never have
If anything you do since you support terrorism which you have proven."

In other words you were lying and you cannot. Got it.

Kinda like the Romans protected the French after killing them and occupying their territory?

Of course it is. It's the exact same thing. But you know it reveals your hippocrisy so you cant comment.

Oh so now all those people don't matter 🤷 turns out you <em>were</em> lying.
Backing out of a nuclear deal has nothing to do with violating sovereignty.
Unilaterally breaking an international contract then escalating tensions is a violation of sovereignty.
Where because I clearly never have If anything you do since you support terrorism which you have proven.
That's twice now you've said you support war and war crimes. I understand you support then. The question is <em>why</em> do you support war and war crimes

"Soleimani has killed 600+ Americans,raided a US embassy and tweeted that the US isn’t going to do anything about it, he has attacked US oil tankers and shot down US drones, and on top of all the he was the worlds no1 terrorist."
"How many people has the US killed in the same time period?  Retaliating against their retaliation against our retaliation against their retaliation against something we did in the 70’s doesn’t really give you a moral high ground.  Doesn’t give anyone involved any moral high ground.  Heck, we shot down an Iranian commercial passenger plane flying in Iranian airspace, killing hundreds of civilians.  That couldn’t possibly be a reason for them to retaliate, could it?  "
"Everyone actively participating in that cycle is to blame.  We don’t get a pass, and we shouldn’t continue it.  If they invade?  Destroy them.  Otherwise stop playing childish retribution games."
So let me get this straight your saying that I can’t claim the moral high ground over the worlds no1 terrorist that has killed over 600+ people? Also we reached an agreement and compensated them very well for the plane that was shot down and both sides were at fault for that incident here is an except from Wikipedia.
"“The reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries. According to the United States government, the crew of USS Vincennes had incorrectly identified the Airbus as an attacking F-14 Tomcat, a U.S.-made jet fighter that had been part of the Iranian Air Force inventory since the 1970s. While the F-14s had been supplied to Iran in an air-to-air configuration,[4][5] the crew of the guided missile cruiser had been briefed that the Iranian F-14s were equipped with air-to-ground ordnance.[6] Vincennes had made ten attempts to contact the aircraft on both military and civilian radio frequencies, but had received no response.[7] The International Civil Aviation Organization said that the flight crew should have been monitoring the civilian frequency.[8] According to the Iranian government, the cruiser negligently shot down the aircraft, which was transmitting IFF squawks in Mode III, a signal that identified it as a civilian aircraft, and not Mode II as used by Iranian military aircraft.[9][10] The event generated a great deal of criticism of the United States. Some analysts blamed the captain of Vincennes, William C. Rogers III, for overly-aggressive behavior in a tense and dangerous environment.[7][11] In the days immediately following the incident, US President Ronald Reagan issued a written diplomatic note to the Iranian government, expressing deep regret.[12] The International Civil Aviation Organization faulted the US for the tragedy, noting, among other things, that, ""American warships in the gulf had no equipment that allowed them to monitor civilian air traffic control radio frequencies, and thus no means of hearing the many radio transmissions between Iran Air Flight 655 and air traffic controllers that would have identified the aircraft to the Vincennes's crew.""[13]"
"In 1996, the governments of the United States and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice which included the statement ""...the United States recognized the aerial incident of 3 July 1988 as a terrible human tragedy and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives caused by the incident...""[14] As part of the settlement, even though the U.S. government did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran, it still agreed to pay US$61.8 million on an ex gratia basis, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims.[15]”"
"So we have paid them for us accidentally killing their civilians but have they paid us for killing our civilians knowingly and on purpose nope and they even boast about it. Sure both sides have done wrong but Iran has clearly escalated this shadow war and done way worse, soleimani was even planning terrorist attacks on the US like they did in 9/11. You say that we can destroy them if they invade but the already have invaded our embassy and that was part of the reason soleimani the worlds no1 terrorist was assassinated he’s had this coming for a long time and was lucky it didn’t happen sooner."
Do you think that Trump has only killed 600 people? lmao.
He hasn’t killed a single person in an unjustified attack. Also why are you so insistent on trying to justify actions of the was worlds no1 terrorist just wondering because unless you are a terrorist too then why defend his rein of terror?
"Maybe I don't agree with either of your appraisals? I don't think that Trump hasn't killed a single person in an unjustified attack, and I don't think Soleimani is the world's number one terrorist."
"I mean, first off, the drone attack on Soleimani also killed five Iraqi officials. Did those guys all deserve to die too? Or is collateral damage fine? Beyond this particular case, in general, American bombings in the Middle East have become more indiscriminate, killing more civilians, with less oversight, under Trump, than even under Obama (who was trash on this issue too)."
"Secondly, Soleimani was a general in military intelligence working for a sovereign nation. In some sense, yes, you could describe him loosely as a terrorist - but then, basically everybody involved in US foreign policy would be a terrorist too, and just by the relative scale probably a way worse one. Trying to cast Soleimani as a terrorist is just straight up noncentral fallacy. When you say ""terrorist"" you imagine an ideologically committed individual who ultimately can only be reasoned with via concession, and who primarily focuses on civilians due to a lack of proper military capacity. In reality, Soleimani was a major leader of ground forces in the fight against ISIS in Iraq (for example, <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/iranian-military-mastermind-leading-battle-recapture-tikrit-isis-311516"" rel=""nofollow"">here's an article about him leading the battle to recapture Tikrit from ISIS</a>), and who was working as the head of military intelligence while operating in the best interests of the government of his nation, which yes includes working with groups like Hezbollah, just like how the US hangs out with Afghani warlords, gave the Taliban their kickstarter package, still buddies up with the Wahhabist psychos in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, etc."
"He is not the ""world's number one terrorist."" Frankly, I doubt you even knew his name a week ago. I know I certainly didn't."
"They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim thousands of our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way. And the officials they killed supported soleimani’s terrorist regime so they were just as bad as him and why is it that they can kill and torture thousands of our people but when we warn them that if they do it again we will proceed with military action and then they do it again and as we warned them we proceeded with military then all of a sudden we are in the wrong? "
"“Beyond this particular case, in general, American bombings in the Middle East have become more indiscriminate, killing more civilians, with less oversight, under Trump, than even under Obama (who was trash on this issue too).” "
This is completely false President Barack Obama has authorized 193 drone strikes killing tons of civilians. Don’t let bias cloud your judgement it shows.
"“Secondly, Soleimani was a general in military intelligence working for a sovereign nation. In some sense, yes, you could describe him loosely as a terrorist - but then, basically everybody involved in US foreign policy would be a terrorist too, and just by the relative scale probably a way worse one. Trying to cast Soleimani as a terrorist is just straight up noncentral fallacy.”"
You couldn’t describe him loosely as a terrorist he literally was the worlds number one terrorist who has killed 600+ Americans and tortured thousands of Americans and Iranians his own people for crying out loud and in no way would a single person involved in foreign policy be a terrorist worse than him that is quite literally the dumbest claim that I’ve ever heard
“Trying to cast Soleimani as a terrorist is just straight up noncentral fallacy.”
Again he was rated the worlds number one terrorist not something you get by killing people justly.
"“ In reality, Soleimani was a major leader of ground forces in the fight against ISIS in Iraq (for example, here's an article about him leading the battle to recapture Tikrit from ISIS), and who was working as the head of military intelligence while operating in the best interests of the government of his nation” "
"He only helped fight isis because it was in his best interests you cant claim that that makes him less of a horrible terrorist, here is an example using your logic since Hitler was against smoking he is now a good guy and his actions are justified."
"“which yes includes working with groups like Hezbollah, just like how the US hangs out with Afghani warlords, gave the Taliban their kickstarter package, still buddies up with the Wahhabist psychos in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, etc.”"
Hezbollah is a terrorist organization there is no justified reason for Iran to help terrorists. Secondly Wahhabist helped in the fighting of terrorism which is definitely not the same as helping a terrorist organization.   
"“He is not the ""world's number one terrorist."" Frankly, I doubt you even knew his name a week ago. I know I certainly didn't.”"
Your right we is not the worlds number one terrorist he was until he was justly assassinated and literally if you actually do some research you would see that he was considered the worlds number one terrorist so just because you don’t think that he was doesn’t mean he wasn’t actually research I fully expect your next response to have actual links to your outlandish claims and if it doesn’t then I’m not responding.

Soilder? Solemani was the second most powerful man in Iran and their leaders closest advisor. He is like Irans version of Tucker Carlson.
Edit: It was a joke because Trump listens more to Tuckers advice than white house intelligence.

The drug lobby is an equal opportunity donation machine. D &amp; R get bribes from the drug lobby and thus have little reason to address price gouging.
Lobbyists pay the govt to make it not a free market at the expense of consumers. 
Why TF would politicians stop this? 
If they were good people who cared about making the economy as best it could be they wouldn't be in that line of work
This is bullshit. Why is the US government so much more incompetent than other nations on this matter? Are US politicians just that much more corrupt?
Nobody is willing to address and fix the root causes of our high prices. The CEO of Gilead directly noted the main reason when questioned by AOC in May. Even she glossed over any real solution.
And what did they say?
The US patent system. American patent protections allow for our incredibly high prices while simultaneously allowing our prices to indirectly subsidize the low prices elsewhere.
I wonder just how much prices would increase overseas if US drug prices dropped. I don't think buyers would be willing to accept much of a price increase after years of low prices.
"If prices don't rise, scarcity will. If a company cannot break even, at a minimum, it will cease to operate."
"They could break even with lower prices, they just want to spend billions on RnD and dividends"
R&amp;D
"R&amp;D is necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace. However, there's likely plenty of unnecessary or overbearing regulatory costs associated with R&amp;D imposed by government that could be removed to lower those costs. "
dividends 
"There's no question that going public tends to alter the goals of a business. Adding in the necessity to increase shareholder value does somewhat reduce a company's likelihood of improving for the sake of employees or customers, but going public is sometimes needed to create an influx of investment capital for many reasons. There's both good and bad to an IPO."
"That’s right. So when someone in Canada or Europe says their drugs are so much cheaper, you can say “you’re welcome”."
"That’s probably majority reason why it’s a problem is that sheer cost of R&amp;D, cost of getting through the FDA, and then theirs a smaller (but still valid) issue of marketing/advertising. "
"If the FDA and patent fees were cheaper then that’d cut costs. I don’t know how to really reduce R&amp;D expenses, but if it was illegal for drug companies to advertise on TV and by other means, that’s several million probably per drug per year! "
"Patients rarely come in mentioning drugs they’ve seen commercials about. Even when they do, I rarely put them on that specific one because it’s usually too expensive and/or not covered."
The tv marketing side is peanuts most of the marketing goes to drug reps taking you out to lunch and telling you about their new and improved boner pill.
"Man, I must be doing things wrong since I don’t get taken out to lunch ever."
"must, only make yourself available during lunch and see how often it becomes a lunch date."
You mean ex cheerleaders offering a free test drive
The marketing budget is like 3 or 4x time R&amp;D budget for most of these companies.  R&amp;D is already subsidized through research grants to universities where these guys have their basic research done. 
"I'd be glad to have the FDA fully take over all of the testing and have it funded by taxes just so I can stop hearing about how it's the FDAs fault and as a bonus, we would have much better information about the real effectiveness and side-effects of drugs getting approved."
The prices of Drugs have sky rocketed since the GOP signed a Libritarian Law banning Medicare and Medicade from negotiating with Pharmaceutical Companies on price.  
Now they must pay what the Market rate is.
Medicare and Medicaid buy half of all drugs used in the US.
"What is the solution to lowering drug prices, a lot of people say Medicare for all or whatever (not my main points of interest when discussing politics so I'm not too informed) but what is a legitimate solution or at least a plausible solution."
cut patent life in half but have them start the day they get FDA approval. Next disallow extensions and let anyone push forward FDA approval for new uses. The new uses should be expeditated as the safety of the drug has already been proven.
Yay capitalism!
"Remember libertarians, if you want to force companies to lower their prices, that means more government, which is bad."
Well in this case what libertarians want is for the government to stop doing what it is doing to artificially increase drug prices.
Such as?
Making competition illegal
Competition is illegal in the medical world?
Our regulatory and patent system makes it impossible to compete. The reason prices are so high is because very few companies have monopolies with patents that guarantee no competition
"But drug companies are all in competition, especially to bring new meds to market faster. So no, competition is not illegal."
Then you try to make a fortune by selling ethically cheap insulin and watch the government arrest your ass 😂
You can get insulin at $25/vial without prescription at Walmart today.

"Anyway, competition is not illegal"
"The more Uncle Sam gets involved, the more convoluted and expensive things get. Price controls never work, they create shortages or force up the price to some to subsidize others. Opening up the insurance market across state lines and doing away with the FDA would be a start. "
"Medicare for all sounds nice but as someone who did finance for a health insurer and had to occasionally audit Medicare Part D; it's a mess when it comes to subsidies. Each ingredient can be subsidized based on the patient's age, sex, and what county they live in. If we were lucky, 40% of Part D payments were correct. Uncle Sam is, by far, the largest customer of prescription medicine and negotiates price based on its favor...the rest of us subsidize that either thru our paycheck withholding or paying more for the same pill. "
Think about that for a second.
"As long as government is involved in any good or service , ... prices will always go up ... either directly or indirectly through taxation ( like how European healthcare is funded )"
Except people in those European nations spend significantly less of their income on healthcare then we do in the US even taking into account increases in tax rates.
So in this case when government gets involved every single real world example has had prices fall.
"The US not only spends more privately on health care per capita, our government also spends more on health care than the vast majority of nations."

Government is evil! The proof is clear. Look at European nations vs Somalia. Clearly the successful one is Somalia where no one would dare take my taxes.
I'd make the argument that it's less government protectionism that truly reduces prices in those countries for drugs. Many of those countries do not enforce drug patents for the length of time that we do here. This means generics are allowed into the market forcing prices down.
Certain countries do negotiate low prices on patented treatments. The result of this tends to drive prices up further in the US but still prevents competition from driving towards the price floor.
Precisely why we cant let the government get involved. Artifical low prices is worse than high ones

If the sick can afford medience easily what incentive do they have to work?
That is easily one of the top 10 dumbest things I have ever read on this subreddit.
I think its a joke
I really can't tell on this subreddit.

"""Now that we've accounted for the low cost of living in Mississippi, we find that Mississippi ($26,517) is no longer the state with the lowest median income in real terms. New York ($26,152) is now the state with the lowest median income due to its very high cost of living."" "
lol If you fudge your numbers enough anything is possible.
"Real nuanced understanding of economics you got there.  ""well government bad, so price go up"""
Patents are a plague of government appointed monopolies. They should not exist.
So basically anyone should be able to steal your idea and make a profit off of it at your expense?   Why would anyone put the money and effort into making something new?
Live and let live.
Yeah only when that individual is you. Anyone else can get fucked.
"When someone is born into poverty without opportunity for education, or has issues paying for medical care, or has a financial disaster that leaves them without retirement, then the Libertarian response is ""that's too bad""."
Sure we have things like social programs in most reasonable modern western nations to help the poor but a Libertarian's ideal of the perfect government type more closely resembles Somalia.
"Live and let live does not mean live and solve everyone's problems. You can make an arguement for that, but it has nothing to do with the original poster's statement."
"Yes I know, the entire Libertarian concept falls apart once you think about it for more than 5 minutes. There's a reason no modern nation outside of say, civil war Libya resembles a Libertarian society."
"Yes I know, the entire Libertarian concept falls apart once you think about it for more than 5 minutes. "
"Then stop spamming this sentence over and over again and get the fuck out of <a href=""/r/libertarian"">r/libertarian</a>."

"This is such a sad, pathetic, facile understanding of libertarian philosophy that I don't even know where to begin."
Do you understand the difference between voluntary and involuntary? Between consent and compulsion?
Are you drinking <em>so much</em> government kool-aid that you think <strong><em>it</em></strong> is the only entity which can provide social programs or assistance?
Are you so cynical to believe that the reason that the US is the most generous/charitable country in the world is due to tax breaks?
"When someone is born into poverty without opportunity for education, or has issues paying for medical care, or has a financial disaster that leaves them without retirement, then the Libertarian response is ""that's too bad""."
"This is a gross mischaracterization and a straight-up straw-man, because you can't actually attack the REAL response."
"When someone is born into poverty without opportunity for education, or has issues paying for medical care, or has a financial disaster that leaves them without retirement, I'm sure that <strong><em>some</em></strong> libertarians may respond with ""that's too bad."" But many others will respond with ""how might we be able to help people like this <em>without</em> using the force of government?"""
It is genuinely sad that you appear to think the government is the only entity which can address these problems...
"If you had spent one <strong><em>minute</em></strong> of your life volunteering or working with charities to help those in need, you wouldn't be able to make such statements, purely due to the perspective of that experience. So yeah, you're obviously a paragon of compassion."
"All of these bullshit ""the government needs to solve these problems"" viewpoints are often supported by virtue-signalling do-nothings who want to believe that they are doing <strong>something</strong> meaningful because they are paying their taxes, some of which go to help those in need."
"If you <strong><em>really</em></strong> cared, you, personally would be out helping those in need."
"Get over yourself. You're part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"This is such a sad, pathetic, facile understanding of libertarian philosophy that I don't even know where to begin."
lol
Do you understand the difference between voluntary and involuntary? Between consent and compulsion?
"Yeah. I think you should have to pay some of your taxes to cover social programs. I do not think you paying or not paying taxes should be your choice. Sorry sucks for you, pay your dues to society you entitled child."
Are you so cynical to believe that the reason that the US is the most generous/charitable country in the world is due to tax breaks?
Certainly more than actual independent charities yes. Literally trillions of dollars more charitable.
"This is a gross mischaracterization and a straight-up straw-man, because you can't actually attack the REAL response. When someone is born into poverty without opportunity for education, or has issues paying for medical care, or has a financial disaster that leaves them without retirement, I'm sure that some libertarians may respond with ""that's too bad."" But many others will respond with ""how might we be able to help people like this without using the force of government?"""
"And yet their only response is ""let private charities handle it"" which again, can't help enough people to be a consistent solution. Of course it always boils down to ""government bad"" when, again, Libertarians offer no solution."
"You think the government is the only entity which can address these problems, do you?"
Government? Yeah pretty much. That's why it exists. Private charities have shown they aren't enough.
"If you had spent one minute of your life volunteering to help those in need, you wouldn't be able to make such statements. So yeah, you're a pinnacle of compassion."
"I've donated blood and plasma. Last year I donated 2,000 dollars to various charities. So yeah suck my ass I've done plenty. Despite that I'm more than happy to have money taken out of my taxes to help those more needy."
"All of these bullshit ""the government needs to solve these problems"" are often supported by virtue-signalling asshats who want to believe that they are doing something meaningful because they are paying their taxes, some of which go to help those in need."
"You still haven't given me a real alternative other than ""anything but government!!"""
"If you really cared, you would help yourself."
"I'm comfortably middle class so I do. I have no issues with my tax dollars being pooled into funds that automatically pay for social services, military, etc. That's part of any modern society."
"Get over yourself. You're part of the problem, not part of the solution."
I think your tax dollars should pay for other people's food stamps and more people will vote for what I want than what you want. Haha
"Yeah. I think you should have to pay some of your taxes to cover social programs. I do not think you paying or not paying taxes should be your choice. Sorry sucks for you, pay your dues to society you entitled child."
"I'm pleased as punch that you're not only an authoritarian, but a proud one. This is my shocked face..."
"I have no issues with my tax dollars being pooled into funds that automatically pay for social services, military, etc."
"Talk about what is done with <strong><em>your</em></strong> dollars all you want, and we're good. Talk about what you want done with <strong><em>mine</em></strong>, and that's where the problems start..."
I think your tax dollars should pay for other people's food stamps and more people will vote for what I want than what you want. Haha
More authoritarianism...  * <strong>shocked face intensifies</strong> * You sure are pretty convinced that you should get a say in what happens with <strong><em>my</em></strong> money. And <em>you</em> called <em>me</em> the entitled child... *  <strong>snort</strong> *That's a good one.

"I'm pleased as punch that you're not only an authoritarian, but a proud one. This is my shocked face..."
"So... anyone who supports any taxes is authoritarian? If you don't want to pay taxes go somewhere where the government is weak enough to not enforce it. Somalia, Libya etc"
"Talk about what is done with your dollars all you want, and we're good. Talk about what you want done with mine, and that's where the problems start..."
Then vote for a candidate who agrees with you. Or vote for a real candidate.

"It is my opinion that nearly any projects with tax money beyond those, and perhaps a few other relative basic governmental functions are increasingly authoritarian. My objection increases proportionally to that interpretation."
Then vote for a candidate who agrees with you. Or vote for a real candidate.
"I have, thanks for your advice."
"Then move? You're in the vast minority. Not just in the US, but in the world."

"Rather because I once thought much more like you do on these topics. That was <strong><em>before</em></strong> I did the research which you are now, humorously recommending to me. It was precisely that research that lead me to change my views."
"I am sad because you, apparently, have done the same research and come to a different conclusion. One that includes the idea that it's ok to tell other people what to do. That is bothersome."
"And because that likely means that either 1) you have a very long journey ahead of you, or 2) you have already tread much of the same philosophical meanderings and ended up in a very different place - one which I personally find to be disappointing and upsettingly common.

When someone is born into poverty
Everybody on the planet is born with nothing but their two front teeth.
without opportunity for education
It's there. There's a common saying that - if the government had a department of shoes then nobody would be able to fathom how you could buy shoes without the government.
issues paying for medical care
Then join me in ending the government created monopolies on medical care so prices can go down
leaves them without retirement
"Nobody ""deserves"" retirement"
Hahahaha Libertarians are retarded
"A key facet of libertarian philosophy is the NAP.  The Non-Aggression Principle. Everything in a libertarian world is based on voluntary consent, not force."
Here's the most difficult hurdle in accepting libertarianism:  It's not just enough to want to be left alone. You need to be willing to leave others alone.
"If any of your beliefs are so right that they must be forced on others for their own good, then you are not a libertarian."
You should learn about classical-liberalism and then check further into libertarianism. 
"<a href=""http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html"">http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html</a>"
Thx! Will check it out
I was in the same spot as you at the same age (22 now). I was conservative but some points didn’t sit right with me and things didn’t feel consistent. Classical liberalism really hit the spot and gave me a comfortable label to identify with. Definitely check it out! (It’s basically a conservative-leaning libertarian in an oversimplified explanation).
"Classical liberalism isn't the only type of libertarianism. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism"" rel=""nofollow"">Left libertarianism</a> is bottom-up grassroot structure that is more socially focused."
Reddit is a cesspool. You won’t learn anything here just witness people being incredibly rude to one another in an attempt to protect their values not because they hold them as a result of intellectual vigour but because they use the identity attached to those values as a vehicle to express themselves.
"You're young and don't know anything yet. My advice is to ignore this sub, ignore other subs, ignore the news, ignore the crap people say unless they are willing to make bets, and instead read."
"Read about philosophy. Read about economics. Go date, go work, and experience everything from being broke to heartbroken. You need much more life experience."
Until then there are basic ideas to hold dear and not much else until you've attained an education:
1) everyone matters
"2) leaving people alone is a basic behavioral trait of a functioning adult. And it is a general human right. Leaving people alone is not entirely clear, as you'll find when you live near loud neighbors or questionable gun owners. Treat this idea as a guideline and carve out a precise path of your own."
"Disregard most of the people here. To reiterate: you need to learn much more before you create a personal manifesto. The people here are twice your age and scarcely know anything about their so called ""libertarianism"" let alone <em>implementing</em> libertarian ideas."
^ This.

Unfortunately there are a lot of trolls spreading BS on this subreddit. Libertarians are not anarchists. We do believe society needs laws and courts. However there shouldn't be laws on the books that are virtually impossible to enforce. Corporations shouldn't be writing laws that regulate their industries. They usually write them in ways that sound good on paper but keep out smaller players and start ups. Which happens way more then the average person knows. Usually because politicians don't know enough about whatever they are regulating and they want campaign money and jobs when they leave office. 
"You will learn more reading books like Don't Hurt People and Take Their Stuff, Matt Kibe. Also, in the US libertarian applies to free market beliefs and individual freedom. In Europe where the term was invented it applies to socialists. So there are people here trying to reclaim its original meaning which can be confusing."
Libertarians are not anarchists. We do believe society needs laws and courts.
"Some libertarians are anarchists, the ancaps, and they too think you need law, police, and courts."
Not sure why you think living in a society without a monopoly State means your can't have those. 
Corporations shouldn't be writing laws that regulate their industries. 
"Then you can't have democracy and politicians, nor centralization of law production."
In Europe where the term was invented it applies to socialists
"To be fair, that usage had fallen out of use."
"Too early, you should go through your socialist stage 1st. Libertarianism is more for well seasoned times."
Lol the share the wealth stage? Nah... I’m not about that. You get what you earn
"There’s a bunch of different libertarians. On one side you have left-leaning libertarianism such as ancoms and libertarian socialists. On the right you have everything from classical liberals to ancaps, as well as the stereotypical libertarian. <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">r/libertarian</a> is kinda in the middle. There’s a bunch of libertarian subreddits you can find on the info bar. And no not all libertarians have to like or agree with each other."
My general idea is everyone should want a small impotent government. A government too weak to oppress anyone.
If it is too weak to oppress people then would it also be too weak to prevent oppression to the weak citizens by the strong?
"Based off pretty much every single real world example in human history yes, a government too small to oppress is also far too weak to protect."
"Good examples include Somalia, Iraq 2010, Libya, much of Northern Afghanistan... Libertarian paradises."
All of those examples had/have oppressive governments.  None of them at any time whatsoever were libertarian in even the slightest bit.  They didn't fail to protect people because of a lack of size or power.  They simply chose not to do so.
"In the case of Somalia, things got exponentially better when their old central government was dismantled, and contrary to popular belief, they were never without government."
"Yeah, that worked out well in the USA."
"Understand there are both left and right libertarians, and the unifying cause is being against authoritarianism, not economic issues."
Reccomend the tried-and-true Political Compass test.
The real definition of economic Libertarianism isn't strictly a left or right ideal but north or south. North is Authoritarianism while south is Libertarian. Effectively is comes down to how much influence you want the government to have on your life.
"I think a lot of people get confused by this and just start yelling ""yeah freedom good less taxes woohoo"" and call it their political position when in reality most Libertarians don't seem to have any realistic ideas on how to make society function without a real government. I get it, politicians are corrupt sometimes. But it's still better than the alternative or having a truly weak government."
"If you believe in freedom.  True freedom, then there is a place for you here.  Freedom is the anchor to all aspects of Libertarianism."
I believe in a limited freedom of sorts. As in freedom limited a little beyond a moral code (maybe like preventing someone from physically harming themself). Is that a philosophy libertarians share or do they believe in a less limited freedom. I’m just trying to get a grasp on the view. Thanks!

"I mean, ultimately it’s the persons choice if they want to kill themselves. But I feel that the government (or 3rd parties) should have ample resources to prevent that choice from being made. Like, if your friend started to repeatedly punch themselves in the face, or stab themselves repeatedly, would you make an effort to stop them? Or would you consider it their freedom to continue? That’s what I’m trying to understand. What do libertarians believe in in that situation?"
You as a friend as more then welcome to help anyone that is important to your life or your own moral compass.  
The difference is that libertarians do not and will not encourage government intervention into freedoms.
"So in that matter, do libertarians believe in governmental law of any kind? Also, other than individual freedom, do they believe in any kind of rights?"
"No laws of any kind.  I mean there is the standard "" don't hurt people, don't take their stuff""."
All rights are viewed as individual rights.  You are free to selectively associate with anyone you wish as long as all associations are voluntary.
You know it's hard to take Libertarians seriously when their description of the perfect government system is basically Somalia.
You really should educate yourself on Somalia.  You keep posting from your ass on it and obviously know nothing about it.

"If you want a book to read, I feel as if, The Libertarian Mind by David Boaz does a good job of explaining moderate libertarianism."
I've got a better idea: instead of shoe horning yourself into an ideology why don't you just be you and go from there.
It’s more of a me trying to understand the types of ideologies so that I can understand what in the name of whatever these politicians are claiming to be/idealize

"Yeah and he probably won't find it here. <a href=""/r/libertarian"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/libertarian</a> is just an echo chamber."
Lol too true.
If I was in 10th grade I would just start shuffling YouTube TED lectures 24/7 and while I sleep.
lol I would just look at Wikipedia for Pokemon articles between bouts of Starcraft and masturbating.
I won't lie I kind of miss those days of 10th grade. Ignorance was bliss.
I got the impression he was trying to find a crowd to fit into.
I wish I could remember who and how someone rebuffed that “you be you” thing. Think it was a commencement speech. Really made a lot of sense. The guy literally said something like “be yourself- was the worst advice I ever got”. Actually I think it was follow you heart or passion when choosing a college major. Idk. Apologies if thought I was .... whatever.
I meant it regarding to figuring out how you stabd politically. Too many people choose a group and hang onto it.  Look into your own heart and for God's sake use your head to figure it out.
"Nah Libertarianism is awful. Almost all of their views fall apart with like 5 minutes of argument. The reason this subreddit exists isn't to have discussion, it's just to have an echo chamber where no one calls out the holes in their ideas. Anyway some basic libertarian ideas are..."
"Libertarians think a free market solves all problems, including ones started by the market. Free markets are good but at certain points the government HAS to step in and break up monopolies or create laws that protect us, consumers."
"Libertarians are against any and all taxes yet still can't explain how that could be feasible at all. Every single nation on the planet has taxes to fund a government that keeps the order, votes on laws and generally just guides the nation. Without taxes roads, infrastructure, telecommunications, water, power, and pretty much anything you can imagine breaks down. Federal taxes distribute wealth in ways that state taxes can't, so some of New York and California's tax money gets sent over to poorer states to assist financially."
"Libertarians call people who disagree with them ""statists"" but that's probably because people who disagree with them can actually back up their arguments with facts and stats rather than ""feelings""."
"Libertarians think owning a hunting rifle is what keeps the government from becoming a dictatorship, despite zero evidence in human history of citizen owned firearms making any difference in their government."
"Libertarians support downsizing the military, which is actually the only thing they think that I agree with. There are counterarguments though such as how the US military dominance has kept the world very peaceful in recent decades."
"Libertarians believe ANYTHING the government does is bad even when shown otherwise. For example in the US we have an <em>awful</em> healthcare system made up of overpriced drugs and predatory health insurance companies. Almost every other nation on the planet has eliminated or restricted private insurance in favor of a taxpayer funded system that allows people to go to the doctor for free, but in the US <em>even if you have insurance</em> you will pay hundreds of dollars. Libertarians think the govt should relax limitations on these companies which has historically shown the companies will just exploit customers even more."
"Libertarians believe government should be so small and weak that it would be impossible for the government to oppress the people. However in the real world this just means the government is too weak to enforce any sort of security. Great examples of weak governments include Somalia, Iraq 2010, Libya, northern Afghanistan, south Sudan, Central African Republic... Libertarian paradises."
"Libertarian ideals, unlike Republican or Democrat have never been successfully implemented anywhere. It's a fantasy that relies on the goodness of humans to not exploit each other but we have thousands of years of human civilization to show that this doesn't work."
Libertarians support legalizing all drugs. Even things like Heroin or Crystal Meth. I feel like i shouldn't have to explain why these things being unrestricted in society is not a good thing.
Libertarians do not support public schooling. Instead of going to school for free with nationalized teaching standards you would be forced to pay for your own schooling. Big issues with this is when poor people can't pay to send their kids to a private school and grow up illiterate.
"tl;dr version Libertarian ideals sound nice when they throw around things like ""free market"", ""non-aggression"" and ""less taxes"" but they're actually completely retarded. They'll say things that sound nice but if you ask them ANYTHING about how they plan on implementing these things they won't have an answer. Look at the posts you're already getting, they're just saying crap like ""live and let live"" rofl. That doesn't even mean anything. I'll get downvoted due to the subreddit I'm in but I just wanted to show the other side of the arguments. Libertarians are basically a political joke."
"You're young, so take your time and learn about the world around you before deciding on a political party. No rush. You also don't need to ""pick"" a party. Just vote for whichever candidate you like the most."
Your problem is you view libertarians exclusively through a right-wing lens.
1) I... kind of agree? Not sure if I understand exactly what you're saying here.
2) Agreed
3) Any that do seem to range from crazy to downright stupid.
"4) Revolutions have happened countless times in human history but it has never been due to the civilian populace being armed, at least not <em>solely</em>."
5) Agreed
"6) What you think are your rights often take away from the rights of others. The US promises the freedom for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness yet the moment things that assist with this like healthcare and education Libertarians get defensive. Sorry but I do think your paycheck should be taxed more so people can afford their diabetes medicine. Most of you would end up paying less in the long run anyway."
7) lol yeah well point me in the direction of that Libertarian state that functions.
8) No it clearly isn't. I get that criminals exists but if you normalize addictive drugs in society the damage would clearly be far worse than the police actions we use to combat it. The best solution is decriminalization and treatment as a mental issue but NOT legalization.
9) Based off this subreddit I feel that very few people agree with that.
Many of us are pro-national healthcare.
"If you support government involvement in healthcare, you aren't a libertarian. Period."
"That is not true. Libertarians can take an all or nothing approach, but they do not have to do so. If one regulation or program is clearly the superior alternative to what we have, then why not support the proposed intervention?"
"Freedom does not exist as some binary concept. If there are 1000 words and the government bans 1 word, then we can say freedom of speech is infringed.  If 500 words were banned we'd say speech is policed 500 times more than the previous 1 word ban."
"If a deal comes along where we can negotiate lifting bans on 250 words and thereby recover at least 250 banned words...well, why the fuck would you be against the idea? Being against that deal is to be against incremental increases in freedom."
"You might be against it because we still have government involvement, but so what? You have to look at regulation within context to see whether or not the regulation diminishes freedom."
You are explaining more of a anarchist ideology rather than libertarianism
"We should not judge our society by our freeways jets, and compromising electrical grid alone but most importantly how that society respects the inate and self evident rights of the greatest minority the, individual."
Yeah only when that individual is you.
"When someone is born into poverty without opportunity for education, or has issues paying for medical care, or has a financial disaster that leaves them without retirement, then the Libertarian response is ""that's too bad""."
Why is that the libertarian response? The libertarian perspective is that you own yourself and you and others have the right to not be violently accosted.
This does not at all say libertarians cannot consider charitable activities and values. What it means is that you will have some people who value altruistic activity and those who do not.
"You might argue that this belief system will leave more people in dire straights than other philosophies, which is fine to argue. But what you're saying about the belief system is entirely false and you know it"
The response is that the solutions must be non governmental not that there should be no solution
"Yes I can name a few nations that have succeeded in that ""non government is best""."
"Somalia in the 90s and 2000s was good. Who needs the security granted by a government when we have gangs and extremists. But hey this was the world's best opportunity to become a real life pirate so it's not all bad. Modern Somalia also has a small, weak government."
Parts of Sudan are rebel run hellholes. Is that what you mean?
Oh there's also Iraq 2010.
Then there's examples where certain parliaments and governing entities were temporarily dissolved like Belgium in 2010-11 and Spain in 2016. But governments were unanimously reinstated and during the absence things in their nations didn't improve.
So do you have any actual examples or do you just throw around nice sounding phrases without any substance?
There are great distinctions between anarchy and    limited govt. You present exagerations and strawman arguements. I would point to pre ww1 america as a more realistic image.
Your only example is from over 100 years ago. Do you have any more modern examples?
"And 1900s America was a shit hole. Women couldn't vote, racism was king, &amp; even the best paid factory job had private goons conducting raids to ensure you weren't consuming alcohol within your residence after work."
Ah the Libertarian dream.
Not many people have managed to successfully escaped the oppression of tyranny sorry that my example of the most powerful and successful  society in the world was not enough for you.
You really think you're living in tyranny in the US right now.
"Do you understand what the NSA does and how we make it a priority to watch citizens, not necessarily tyranny but the government does a lot of shit that isnt exactly good."
I think the presence is building. And the potential  becomes greater as we continue to consolidate and centralize power. We are at the point imo where the benefits to our society are becoming the means by which we are held hostage to it.
"LMAO. How's that working for Australia? The whole continent is literally on fire, yet private charity is barely breaking even supporting full time firefighters, let alone the volunteers."
"Forest fires happen man. I certainly wonder if the Aborigines, if given the same rights and representation as an Australian citizen,  would have positively influenced general preparedness of the country for these kind of natural (though possibly influenced by global warming) disasters that happen everywhere without discretion."
"The thing about politics is that if you give it a week, people will forget about it."
"Biden, as in Joe Biden who told Trump threats to Iran are dangerous? That Biden?"
"When he makes statements like that, it just seems to me to be he’s going off on a tweetstorm on his own, and it’s incredibly dangerous and irresponsible,” Biden told reporters before a campaign event in Iowa. Biden said that Trump is becoming “more irrational” as “the walls close in.”"
"Biden, the guy who said Trumps action in Iran demonstrate flawed understanding of international politics?"
"Pretty sure Bidens main concern is not engaging in a hot war with Iran. However he cant block war with Iran, he isnt a congressmen."
"I don't understand, I was told by all the Trumplings this attack would show Iran America's powers and make them too scared to act out again?"
I was under the impression that the nuclear deal was scrapped by America years ago.
This is like your ex girlfriend calling you up and telling you it's over.
"The United States no longer abided by it but Iran continued to do so along with the other signatories, it was still in affect just without the US participating"
You should do more reading before you talk

Definitely need to stop reading leftist propaganda I guess.
Iran had been continuing with parts of it along with the EU.
US already abandon it and sanctioned Iran. Thought Iran ditched it too shortly thereafter.
Thought Iran ditched it too shortly thereafter.
Iran has been gradually relaxing/removing individual parts of it (rather than tearing it up entirely) while the other countries involved have tried to keep it on life-support.
"Hmm. Makes sense. Unfortunately as long as the USA is sanctioning Iran, Iran has no reason to give a shit."
I wonder if there <del>are</del> were any moderates in Iran trying to buy time until the political winds changed inside the US.
There is a political struggle within Iran between moderates and hardliners which moderates have been losing since Trump tore up the Iran deal which the hardliners predicted. US aggression is the best thing for the hardliners since they can hold off any reforms as long as they are in a siege mentality and any attempts by moderates to deal with the US will look like capitulation if the US reneges on it.
Iran has no reason to give a shit.
"Here's the thing.  I think you mean ""The Iranian government"" when you say Iran and it took the US to find and eliminate a high ranking Iranian official within 48 hours of wanting to."
"As a shopkeeper, I wouldn't care.  But as the leader of Iran, I'd be having my secretary starting my car for me."
"Shopkeepers would care after Trump threatened to blow up ""important cultural sites"" within Iran."
"Not really, the whole reason the nuclear agreement worked is we got their other trading partners to sanction them until they abided by the deal. USA does very little trade with Iran, or affecting the Iran economy. We have been sanctioning them for decades."
Yeah.
...but no.
"<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-middle-east-48119109"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-middle-east-48119109</a>"
"That have effects, but we have been sanctions on them for decades yet they never agreed to halt their program. "
Why did we need all our allies to sign as well if sanctions were working so well?
There were other nations involved with the deal whom Iran was still honoring the deal with.
"Figured without the US, Iran would give up because its pointless. Oh well."
I think the other countries were slow walking any progress until the US came to its senses and elected a president that supports it.  That seems to be out the window now.
4D Chess being played here!  
How else are we going to get Iran to ACTUALLY develop that nuke program if we don't provoke them to leave the 'we promise to not make nukes' program?
"This way we can LEGITIMATELY invade them for developing nukes!  Because no one else should have them but us, unless you already have them... and if you DO - you're guaranteed to be invasion-free.  (Iran is gonna study the N. Korea playbook now.)"
U.S. foreign policy rank: 1 million facepalms out of 5.
no told you they couldn't be trusted to abide by the deal!
Isnt the choice between sending them taxpayer money so they don't develop nuclear weapon capabilities or not sending them money and they do enrich the nuclear material they have?
"Instead of sending their leaders American tax money as tribute, we sent one of them a hypersonic missile."
Plata o Pluomo.
"We didn't give them taxpayer money, we unfroze their foreign accounts and Iran allowed IAEA to supervise compliance which Iran was doing until the US placed sanctions on Iran and violated the deal under Trump."
"Yeah true, I guess trump wants to restrict Americans doing business with a state known to sponsor terrorism. Didn't the documents Israel stole show that they did not and weren't complying with JCPOA?"
Trump is fine with Americans doing business with Saudi Arabia which his family has personally done.
"No, Israel made a presentation showing how Iran is untrustworthy historically prior to 2015, but their intelligence did not reveal new information about any weaponized research done by Iran which violated JPCOA which is why European governments maintained the deal. Israel is not an impartial actor under Netanyahu and has many reasons to want the deal dismantled but the IAEA has produced numerous reports showing that Iran was compliant with JPCOA."
"Yes the Saudi business is hypocritical, morally speaking should they also be sanctioned for their sponsoring of terrorism and human rights abuses?"
"I thought the intelligence showed that Iran preserved rather then destroyed material related to developing nuclear weapons, that there was nuclear equipment and testing sites that the Iranians failed to disclose for the IAEA inspections and that they continued nuclear weapons research in covert channels?"
What do you think Israeli intentions are other then to limit the military power and nuclear capabilities of Iran? It seems that is in Israels interest of reducing Iranian proxy attacks on them
I'd say at a minimum they should not be provided materiel and militarily support while they carry out terrorism and genocide but the US's decision to support KSA have nothing to do with morality and everything to do with geopolitical considerations.
"Israel wants a weak Iran which cannot attack them. Netanyahu for domestic reasons was playing up the Iranian threat in an unsuccessful attempt to stay in power, just as Iranian hardliners play up the threat from the US to maintain power."
This is good. Less government getting in the way of capitalism. Thanks trump.
trump bad
Trump communist who takes my money for socialist programs.
You're saying this shit all over the place. Idk what you're fucking talking about.
"Haha, that is so funny how the legislative branch is trying to pass a bill to get their constitutional rights to war powers back.  "
"Fuck authoritarianism, this is ridiculous."
Bernie introducing this bill would seem to indicate that if he were elected he would give up some executive powers though doesn’t it?
If anyone would do it he would.
"Remember when Obama said he would protect whistleblowers, Trump said he would bring home the troops, Reagan said he would shrink government, etc?"
He's not Obama.
Trump wasn't either
"Intentional or not I feel as if the way presidential elections play out here in the u.s. make it so no honest person can win a primary,  let alone the office."
After they gave it up in the first place because they're mostly bootlick authoritarian fucks
"""Fuck authoritarianism"""
"Couldn't agree more, but this isn't the legislative branch, this is a person who is also running for president. "
"Sanders has a lot of crazy ideas that won't become a reality once a bill is set to be voted on with a price tag, look at what happened in C.A. with their single payer attempts. They got a dem supermajority, tried to make it happen, and everyone laughed at the price tag. But there is a lot of good things the man does that are worth selectively supporting."
He is actually in the legislative branch. His bill is legislation. 
He is trying to get to the top of the executive branch.
"He isnt the entire legislative branch, most of the currently elected officials representing us there will never support his legislation."
He most likely is aware of this and is and at best hoping to put their vote on the matter to the public record. At worst he is signaling his foreign policy stance on the matter should he become president.
"If someone like Bernie was willing to commit to lessening the power of the executive and give back power to the legislative, would that be enough for libertarian minded people to hold their nose and vote for him? I know there’s almost complete disagreement with other policies but this could be one of the longer lasting legacies. I’ve thought it would be smart idea for him to announce he would do so"
"It's not like trump is gonna shrink gov, reduce spending, and refrain from starting more illegal wars, I don't like bernie but if it comes down to those two I don't understand how principled libertarians who don't vote third party pick trump."
He wants to vastly increase government power overall. Him claiming he wants to shuffle it around a little bit does not give him a pass.
"Fuck socialists, but damn, staying out of  another needless war sounds good to me..."
"In a two party system, the best you can do is support individual acts that you agree with and denounce the ones you don't, no matter who is shilling then out."
Bernie's heart is always in the right place unfortunately his mind isn't. I pity Iran's infantry. They should just surrender.
"The problem is that he is an old man, asking for the most powerful seat at the table, while simultaneously asking for unprecedented power over the economy for that seat. Socialism and the resulting wealth redistribution gives the govt absurd power over the individual’s finances. Even if he would handle that power morally (full disclosure; I don’t believe he would) it cannot be guaranteed, nor is it even remotely likely, that all subsequent presidents would behave morally with this power. Unfortunately, you can vote to give govt that kind of clout, but it damn near always requires violence to wrestle it back away. "
"I will concede I think his supporters want positive outcome, and believe he can provide. I just don’t believe it CAN happen, let alone will. "
Peace
Indeed.
"Well. To be honest fight against some hardcore Islamist branches, like the one in Iran, is not that bad."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I'm aware USA didn't do something specific and bad to Al-Qaeda or Bin Laden. USA helped Mujahideen in 1980s to fight against Soviets and 20 years later, some of Mujahideen who formed Al-Qaeda, they decided to attack USA. Is this something I'm missing?"
Iraq war 1 and our prolonged bases as a result.
Vague answers are as much worth as just not responding.
How is that vague?  That’s what you are missing. That’s why they attacked us. We meddled and left bases as a result of a regional squabble that had nothing to do with us.  The theocrats in the region viewed it as an “invasion” and responded in the only effective manner at their disposal.
"Apologies, I assumed you could put 2+2 together. "

"That is rich coming from the person who describes complex wars in the middle east where drone strikes are authorized at weddings of 100+ people to kill one individual, as ""fight""."

"Democrats have to tread very carefully as to not be viewed as pro-Iran. Iran is an authoritarian Shia Islamic state that slices fingers off for theft, has the death penalty for gays, torture is commonplace, and it routinely represses freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly."
Democrats have to tread very carefully as to not be viewed as pro-Iran. 
"Fuck that.  Just call out anyone using the ""you don't want to start an unwinnable forever war so you must love Iran's government"" as the dishonest, bad faith, warmongering piece of shit they are.  "
"When you say ""Iran is bad but we shouldn't bomb them"" you're presenting ""Iran is bad"" as a <em>fact</em> and ""we shouldn't bomb them"" as your <em>opinion.</em>  No one gives a fuck about your opinion, so all you wind up doing is reinforcing half of the justification for war (""Iran is bad"")."
"as the dishonest, bad faith, warmongering piece of shit they are."
"my man, ""conservative"" is only 12 letters."
"It doesn't automatically follow that if you don't like someone, you should bomb their country into the stone age. Even if you're working with quasi-utilitarian maths of how many would die in  a war vs how many would die under the current regime, you're banking on a happy, stable country that likes you popping up in the bombsite you just created. The war in Iraq lead to ISIS running rampant for years, and the new government isn't exactly a paragon of fair democracy."
"I'm being sarcastic: Some of the conservative Islamic countries are socially already in the barbaric stone age, so we don't need to bother bombing them."
There isn't going to be a war with Iran. All of this postering and war rhetoric will slowly die down.
I'd be more confident of that if the US president came across as mentally stable.
I don't like North Korea.
I don't support bombing Kim Jong-Un.
Am I a traitor?
Where was he when Obama was doing this crap ...
"Saying the same shit, while Democrats called him ignorant and stupid."
"It's true. He's been pretty anti war for quite a few decades now. Economically illiterate, but actually against war."
Economically illiterate
"That's a pretty funny statement on the ""taxes are theft"" subreddit."
"What’s funny about economically literate people (the type who understand that income taxes are a form of legal theft, much like the death penalty is a legal form of murder) calling out economically illiterate people like Bernie."
"For example, Bernie said “ It makes no sense that students and their parents pay higher interest rates for college than they pay for car loans or housing mortgages.”. He not only doesn’t understand default rates and how that goes into loan pricing, but also doesn’t know the difference between a secured and unsecured loan.  This is basic, basic financial literacy."
economically literate people (the type who understand that income taxes are a form of legal theft
lol
the type who understand that income taxes are a form of legal theft
"Theft is a legal term. Instead, you should say ""taxation is extortion,"" but it's not catchy enough to recruit new 16 year olds that make up the libertarian party."
I notice you don’t dispute that Bernie is an economic illiterate...
"Nope, I've never seen anything to suggest that. All of his policies have been successfully done elsewhere or are simply expansions of existing US programs."
I get that you're probably a Libertarian who dreams of a state economic policy similar to that of 1780s America or modern day anarchy Somalia but in the real modern world society has collectively grown to understand that certain items are best delivered to people via taxation rather than blindly trusting a predatory market.
Same place he was when Bush was. Fighting against it.
"sure, thats why he voted for funding the wars under Obama like the 2006 Iraq War funding bill .. puhlease .. it just shows like all Dems, he is a 1-peercenter partisan hack"
"Oh look, a lie."
he voted for that one because of the hurricane katrina relief that was tied to it.
He's been saying this shit since before Obama even took office.
"sure, thats why he voted for fuunding the wars under Obama like the 2006 Iraq War funding bill .. puhlease"
Nope.
When did Obama try to start a war with Iran?
"Just Libya, Yemen and Syria. We saw how well those adventures worked out."
He was against intervention in all of them.
Who was?
Bernie. Should've clarified.
Pretty sure he voted for Libya
"He signed a non-binding resolution that amounted to ""Assad bad"" after he gassed his people."
Congress never actually held a vote on intervention.
I don't think anyone voted for using military force in Libya because Obama just went ahead and did it without asking Congress.
"Obama didn't, but he did assassinate dozens of suspected terrorists with predator drones to preemptively save innocent lives. Each president, and every era -- even during relative peacetime, has had its own sets of foreign conflicts."
Who argued otherwise?
"They weren’t wars, they were “kinetic actions”. And Democrats hand waved them all away as Obama and co threw the Middle East into turmoil."
"Yeah, the middle East was a serene garden of tranquility previously"
Did we declare war against Iran?  
"What a monumentally stupid move.  I'm all about making moves to limit our global military presence but the US legislative branch, which largely deals with domestic issues, shouldn't be passing resolutions that essentially tell other countries that we're helpless to fight back if they choose to attack us.  This move is congress taking the side of a foreign country over the White House on a geopolitical issue they literally can't know more about than the executive branch does."
"All this would do is force the president to seek approval from the legislative branch, the way it was intended and written in the constitution that everyone swears to uphold."
What war?  Did he vote to defund the Easter Bunny also?
Out of Trump and all the other major candidates for president how the fuck is the open socialist coming out the most libertarian of them?!
bernie is lib left we are lib right lib unity is best unity
"Who is ""we""? 2D political compass is not sufficient to explain the entirety of politics."
"Wait, he doesn’t like paying for things that someone else wants?"
That's nice. Tell me when he gets half the gop in congress to go along with it. Until then Trump just has to veto it and that's the end of the bill.
Bernie is a con and a coward
"There was no Market Crash.
There was no ""Muslim Ban"".
There was no Vape Ban.
There was no Collusion.
There was no Quid Pro Quo. "
And there is going to be no War.
Are any of you alarmist going to apologize?
And they say quality political satire is dead.
You're a fucking moron
"I assumed, at this point, that the account is performance art."
The only true statement is that there was no market crash.
"Are you joking? There has been a Muslim ban, my university even strongly suggested all int'l students from affected countries never to leave US until policy changes."
That's weird they only recommended students from affected countries not leave. Why didn't they recommend all non-American Muslim students not leave?
"Because if you're not one of the pinpointed countries it's impossible for them to prove you're Muslim hence it would be unenforceable to blanket ban all ""Muslims"" (your passport doesn't include your religion). Which is exactly why Trump made a laundry list of Muslim countries and banned people from there entering US."
Which is exactly why Trump made a laundry list of Muslim countries 
"But he didn't do this, Obama did."
What did they die for?

Looks like we're going to have to bomb Kenya now...

They should have a separate category for every gender. 
"Or, fairer yet, combine all genders into a single category. All inclusive."
"Exactly...disqualify gender, best athlete wins."
Funny when the Soviet Bloc women athletes from places like East Germany were using drugs to enhance their chance of winning it was called cheating.  So when women take drugs to beat other women...cheating.  When men take drugs to beat women...brave.

"Iran controls iraq now, hooray!!!"
"I do not know enough about the assassination to form a strong opinion, but Trump appears to be escalating even further after that which is foolish. Escalation and appeasement are not the only two choices."
Trump is just doing this so people are distracted so he can rape underage boys.
"Trump's assassination of Soleimani is taking us out of this diplomatic quagmire.  He is signaling that the years of appeasement of Iran are over.  Hiding behind terrorist proxy groups has worked for Iran since the ayatollahs took over in the 1970s.  This strike against the head of the Revolutionary Guards may cause the cowardly leaders of Iran to reconsider their modus operandi on the world stage, or it may lead to a lashing out.  Whichever path they take, our resolve to stop participating in the cycle of terror attacks and subsequent appeasement of a rogue state is now affirmed."

"I cannot fathom why Trump threatened to destroy cultural treasures, what a fucking moron."
Especially since threatening to destroy cultural sites is the best way to get the entire country on the side of “fuck the US”
For votes.
"Its popular among his base who're absolute morons who want to bathe in blood, terrorize their enemies and see no consequences for their actions."
What cultural sites did he threaten to destroy? I keep hearing the claim but can’t find an example.
"He wasn't specific, he announced it over twitter  <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213593975732527112"">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213593975732527112</a>"
"And what’s the problem here exactly? He’s not saying we will specifically target cultural sites. Plenty of valid military targets are also culturally important, y’all can stop clutching your pearls any time."
"Plenty of valid military targets are also culturally important,"
Such as?
"In America you have the White House, any capital building, etc. I’m sure there are plenty of equivalents in Iran."
Attacking them because they are culturally significant is still a war crime. Your next argument will be that he can get away with it by lying. And we all know that Trump will lie about anything.
orangemanbad
"Seriously though if this is your definition of ""war crime"", then it's impossible to wage war."
"It isn't my definition. The Geneva Convention lists attacking cultural targets as a war crime. Yes, the criminal is bad. Do your think that orange people are sent by God or can they be bad?"
"The US isn't bound by those protocols as far as I know. Even so, this only applies to civilian targets. Saying ""targeting cultural sites is a war crime"" doesn't mean that any target with cultural significance, no matter how militarily valid, is somehow off limits. "
"With respect to attacking religious or cultural objects, the Statute of the International Criminal Court uses as the basis for this war crime the fact that such an attack is a violation of customary international law, in particular because the <strong>objects referred to are civilian</strong> and this prohibition is included in the Hague Regulations"
"<a href=""https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156</a>"
"Again, plenty of military targets have cultural significance. The British were not committing a war crime when they burned down the White House, for instance. The Allies were not committing war crimes when they stormed and shot up the Reichstag. It also would not be a war crime to bomb, say, the Beit Rahbari. All these places are important to their respective cultures, but are also completely valid military targets. "
"Now, if it turns out we go to war with Iran (which is highly unlikely) and Trump orders the destruction of civilian historical sites with no military justification, I will stand right there with you and condemn it. Persia is an ancient culture and it's historical/religious artifacts are important to all of humanity. But, none of that has happened. All that's happened is that Trump said something vague and inflammatory. Then, y'all extrapolated the worst possible implication and used it as cause to run around like your hair is on fire. Calm down, take a breath, and stop getting upset over fantasies."

The Iranians referred to their nuke sites as being places of cultural importance during the JCPOA negotiations.
"Trump talked about targeting areas of cultural importance, which is what the Iranian minister is referring to."
you're literally shilling for a government that wants you dead.
"Iran doesn't want me dead, Iran wants the US out of the Middle East so it can exercise greater influence over the region.  That's all this is about, who is top dog in the area.  Its not personal"
"Ok, but? Iran is literally violating international laws on a daily basis, this is meaningless coming from them."
What's meaningless? Those are their objectives.
I'm saying it's meaningless for Iran to complain about violating 'international law' - when they break it every time.
Also:
"Iran doesn't want me dead, Iran wants the US out of the Middle East so it can exercise greater influence over the region. That's all this is about, who is top dog in the area. Its not personal"
"Iran definitely wants you dead, or at the very least subservient to them. Just watch how they treat their own, let alone sinners like you. Iran has a goal of entirely eradicating Israel from existence, they openly admit so - and if given a chance they would do the same to every other nation that doesn't fall in line with them."
"The US frequently violate international law, who cares? Countries do what they feel is in their interest, that's what matters."
And your craziness about Iran wanting to subjugate the world or whatever is absurd and has no basis in reality
"You're making no sense. This article's headline is Iran complaining about the U.S violating international law, through war crimes; for targeting cultural sites. "
​
If you want to say international law is meaningless go ahead. Then this article is meaningless too.
​
"Also, my ""craziness"" is based on the facts of the matter, the Iranian regime is theocratic and fanatic, they want to spread their religion and see it as their god-given duty. They have daily chants of ""death to America and Israel"", they spread worldwide terror, they are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands."
​
"The idiocy is comparing the U.S with Iran, as if these two are comparable at all. It's a god-awful position similar to being a ""both sides"" in WW2 and saying ""Well, Nazis aren't the only ones who are bad! The UK bombed citizens!"" "
"Iran is a force of evil, and is a threat to world peace, the major ones pushing the pro-Iranian position are Russian disinformats."
"The point of the article is to show how far we've fallen as a nation and people that we don't care about these things of things, how instead of Iran talking about destroying our culture it is us talking about destroying there's.  The point is an appeal to be better than that. "
they are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands.
"Over a million Iraqis and Afghans have died in the last 20 years due to conflicts waged by the United States, you can't claim any moral authority from how many people Iran has killed. "
"Also, my ""craziness"" is based on the facts of the matter, the Iranian regime is theocratic and fanatic, they want to spread their religion and see it as their god-given duty. Iran is a force of evil, and is a threat to world peace"
And for that belief you want to wage war until what?  What does victory look like?  Are you going to convert them away from their religion that you think is so fanatic and has driven them into the single minded purpose of converting the world?
What exactly do you want to accomplish in this war?
"Over a million Iraqis and Afghans have died in the last 20 years due to conflicts waged by the United States, you can’t claim any moral authority from how many people Iran has killed."
"There were over 10 times as many Germans killed than Brits in WW2, the death tolls of Nazi German citizens far outnumbered the British - it was a massacre. Following your logic, the people who fought the Nazis had no moral authority to do so. "
I love it when people try to equate between evil fanatics who value zealotry over life - the Iranian regime is evil. It is compelled by religious fanaticism and zealotry.

If you’d look at my history long ago I was against leaving the Iran deal in the first place.  I’m most certainly not in favor of war. 
"A war with Iran is not ideal, it’ll cause quite a lot suffering, the goal should be containment of Iran’s ability to exert its force - ie, preventing them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction such as nukes. The way I would go about it would be through amending the Iran deal in the future, with allies, and with benefits granted to the regimes stability in exchange for its cooperation."
"Also, you seem to be strawmaning me by asking if I’m going to force them to convert; the Iranian people, in its majority, aren’t nearly as fanatical as the regime is. Iran is controlled by one man - who hasn’t traveled outside of Iran for 30 years, and who surrounds himself with religious extremist yes-men that don’t criticize him or offer alternative actions to his own. "
"This isn’t a problem with Islam in particular, zealotry can take form in any religion or none at all(like Stalinism). "
So to answer your question simply - the goal is to prevent a nuclear Iran. Doing so ideally without war.
"There were over 10 times as many Germans killed than Brits in WW2, the death tolls of Nazi German citizens far outnumbered the British - it was a massacre. Following your logic, the people who fought the Nazis had no moral authority to do so."
"Iraq and Afghanistan weren't Nazi Germany, conducting military actions in war that kill civilians is permissive when its a military necessity, provides a proportional military advantage, and when other options are unavailable.  That is not the case in Afghanistan or certainly Iraq for most of those dead, especially not Iraq since the entire basis for the war was a lie no civilian deaths can ultimately be justified. "
"Also, you seem to be strawmaning me "
"Sorry when you said ""Iran"" I thought you meant the entire country not a single person even if that person is the leader of that country.  I genuinely misunderstood you and I wasn't trying to misrepresent your arguments, I'm glad to hear you're in favor of a peaceful solution I was worried you were going to tell me we have to wage war until they(being all or most Iranians) change their minds"
And he keeps going
"You aren't responding with any substantive arguments because you have no substance behind your arguments, its all just belief and faith in Dear Leader isn't it?"
I wonder why they hate Americans...
"Context free yes he is right, however if you’re storing terrorists and weapons of war in said cultural site like Palestine does with hospitals then no, it’s not immune"
Are they?
This whole issue truly shows why things can get too libertarian. Iran is litterally threatening us and yall keep saying to do nothing at all.
"Of course they're threatening us, we're threatening them and they want us to change our policy towards them just like we want them to change their policy towards us."
The fact they are making threats is no more reason for us to go to war as the fact we are making threats is reason for them to go to war.  Not every threat has to be responded to with violence
So you’re saying that if they bomb us tomorrow we should just do nothing
"Of course not, we were talking about threats not actions.  If they bombed the US or US troops we should respond differently than if they had only threatened to do so."
Ok I don't support the actions that have taken place and agree with your statement but how would that work in a different scenario? For example if your neighbor threatened to shoot you in your sleep (and you know he is capable) how would you deal with it?
This analogy is baseless because countries are not like two neighbors that don't get along.  There's no reason to talk through this issue with analogy because its right here in front of us.
As for how I'd deal with Iran's threats? I'd largely ignore them and try to deescalate the situation by getting out of this cycle of violence.  I'd also move most if not all our troops out of Iraq where they are vulnerable to Iranian attacks because we clearly are failing to keep Iraq out of Iran's sphere and therefore there is no reason to keep those troops there.
"That will give us space, which is what we need, we won't be as tempted to overreact to threats when there aren't vulnerable targets and then we can try to escalate the situation as it was five years ago when we signed the Iran denuclearization deal."
Damn had no idea there were so many supporters of foreign wars
How are they threatening us?
Iran poses no threat to the US.
"As long as we make sure they’re gonna regret anything they try, true. They won’t even touch us."
Don't you think the US and Saudis set him up. They invite him to negotiate and smoke his ass when he shows up.
He deserved it he was a bad man.
He was an official of a recognized government. There were other ways to have gotten him other than assassination.
He was a piece of shit that deserved it.
"As the saying goes, we've all got it coming, kid."
Go enlist in the military and volunteer for the front lines or keep your mouth shut.
Are you defending terrorism?
I'm defending common sense. 
"Get off your rascal scooter, go down to your nearest recruiting station, and enlist. Otherwise keep your mouth shut. It's easy to call for war when it's not your fat ass on the line."
So youre saying that terrorism is ok then how about you go join isis if you think that terrorism isn’t bad.
*you're
Have you enlisted yet?
Have you englistes to join isis yet?
Okay so you still haven't enlisted yet keep running your mouth about war like a coward. And learn how to spell correctly.
Enlisting has nothing to do with the fact that a terrorist deserved what he got and unless you’ve enlisted yourself you can’t talk.
By attacking our Embassy? Lololol.
Someone else said he was there for a funeral. :/
Didn’t this guy leave the GOP specifically because he was moving leftward fiscally?
Yep. He also supports gun control and voted for the Patriot Act.
"I like Lincoln in a lot of ways, and he's <em>right</em> about the metric system. But unless he's changed several positions with this party switch, the LP is far too right-wing to take him on as their standard bearer."

"Lincoln Chafee is not remotely libertarian.

Low quality satire.

So Jesus wasn't a socialist because he didn't expect the Romans to care for the sick and poor with the taxes he gave them? 
"We don't live in Roman times anymore.  Jesus wanted to take care of the sick and poor and ""heartfelt charity"" doesn't even begin to cut it.  This article only makes sense if the writer thought that taking care of the poor was just a moral exercise for the wealthy and middle class."
"It doesn't make sense politically either, since the Romans were seen as a conquering force which had installed their own king (Herod, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents"" rel=""nofollow"">who in folklore massacred Bethlehem babies</a>) and later governor (Pilate) and <em>caused</em> much of the suffering through new taxes that went out of the region as tribute."
"What kind of ""passive resistance to the foreign oppressor"" guy is gonna say ""hey let's incorporate the foreign oppressor into a long-term solution""?"
"He can't say ""overthrow the Romans and do it ourselves"" either, because that's just an invitation to get crucified. Hence the phrase ""render undo Caesar"", and not ""Go tell Caesar to fuck himself! Israel forever!"""
Jesus wanted to care for the sick and poor.  And he wanted us to want to care for the sick and poor. But I think it's hard to make a Christ based argument for the gun to the head approach of modern Socialism.  
Is there any New Testament support for using force to compel someone to act against their own wishes?  It seems like volition is key to Christ's teachings.
"In acts God kills two people for keeping some money. Some will say it was because they lied but Judas lied, Peter lied, God killed none of them. "
"Also we have the passages that the followers shared in all things, everything belonged to everyone."
"God can be fickle.  Awkward, but true."
"The easiest, least painful, most coordinated and efficient way to care for the sick and poor is to let government do it. "
"If we just rely on charity, then most of the poor and sick won't receive any help at all, and we'd be remiss as a society on taking care of them.  We can't force people to contribute to charities against their will to the extent that there would be any significant impact on the lives of the poor and sick.   And charities are rife with fraud and inefficiency.  <a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4946"" rel=""nofollow"">Many even legitimate ones contribute less than half of what they collect to actually solving their cause</a>.  It's such a problem that we need multiple watchdogs to keep track of which charities we should and shouldn't contribute to.  And then <a href=""https://mondaylovesyou.com/charity-ratings-compared"" rel=""nofollow"">watchdogs for those watchdogs.</a>."
"If you actually care about the sick and poor you'd want to make sure they were actually given aid by an entity with steady reliable funding, strict oversight, and that treats all it's beneficiaries equally.  That'd be the government."
"And it's the smart thing to do, because everyone shy of a multimillionaire is just one car accident away from needing charity to survive."
"You have very strong opinions, and you express them well.  I'd caution you against statements like ""If you actually care about the sick and poor you'd want to make sure they were actually given aid by an entity with steady reliable funding, strict oversight, and that treats all it's beneficiaries equally.""   It sounds too much like ""if you are a good person you will think what I think."
"I see a world in which the adoption of free market capitalism in Africa, India, and China has raised billions out of extreme poverty.  When in the same time frame the adoption of socialist policies in the U.S has created a permanent underclass from which there is no escape.  "
The government does several things well.  But controlling the economy is not one of them.
"The easiest, least painful, most coordinated and efficient way to care for the sick and poor is to let government do it."
The government isn't doing it though. The government is forcing the people to do it. Libertarianism is a statement that human interactions be voluntary.
"And here's the rub.  To be a purist libertarian you have to be okay with just letting the sick and disabled and their families starve.  And since we are all just one bad day away from being in the class of sick and disabled, that means none of us have any security that we can survive, even if we aren't permanently disabled or deathly ill."
"Which is why I can never be an extremist libertarian. Because I believe a person can not have liberty if they have no opportunity to survive or better themselves if something bad, through no fault of their own, happens to them.  Chipping in to the government in the form of taxes is our way of protecting against bad days becoming unavoidable death and ruin."
"And here's the rub. To be a purist libertarian you have to be okay with just letting the sick and disabled and their families starve. And since we are all just one bad day away from being in the class of sick and disabled, that means none of us have any security that we can survive, even if we aren't permanently disabled or deathly ill."
"That doesn't mean that at all. Libertarianism is just anti-aggression. It has nothing to say about how you treat others, except that you can't aggress against them."
"Except in practical terms that’s exactly what it means.  The ultimate result of “non-aggression” is allowing people to be exploited while able bodied and die of neglect the moment they aren’t.   If there is no duty whatsoever to anyone but yourself, then there is no benefit whatsoever in existing in a society."
Except in practical terms that’s exactly what it means.
It means that human interactions be voluntary? Or do you mean that you are required to be selfish and never give unto others and human beings can only be good if forced to under threat of violence?
"People are selfish by nature.  Voluntary charity cannot provide for the poor and disabled.  We don’t need to guess, we just need to look at the past.  Or at any of the many countries don’t have social services.  "
You keep saying it’s an act of violence to pay your taxes.  It’s not like the punishment is death or a beating.  You get your wages garnished and maybe go to jail for a couple years if you were particularly stubborn about it.
People are selfish by nature. 
"Some are, but the majority are not, despite Ayn Rand's objections to the contrary. <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/57991-conflicts-of-interest-science-humans-selfish-cooperation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This has been proven in studies</a>"
"<em>At the heart of any conflict-of-interest situation is the question of whether to act in your own best interest or do what is best for the greater good. Trump's issues might make a cynic shrug. After all, don't we all look out only for ourselves?</em>"
"<em>Psychological research suggests the opposite: that self-interest is far from people's primary motivation. In fact, humans are prone to act for the good of the group, many studies have found.</em>"
"Voluntary charity cannot provide for the poor and disabled. We don’t need to guess, we just need to look at the past. "
"I could make the argument against this but Professor Daniel Shapiro <a href=""https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/12/will-private-charity-be-enough/"" rel=""nofollow"">has already done so better than I ever could.</a>"
Or at any of the many countries don’t have social services.
Do you mean impoverished countries?
You keep saying it’s an act of violence to pay your taxes.
"Feel free to quote me where I said it's an act of violence to pay your taxes. I believe I said ""human beings can only be good if forced to under <strong>threat</strong> of violence"""
It’s not like the punishment is death or a beating. You get your wages garnished and maybe go to jail for a couple years if you were particularly stubborn about it.
And if you choose not to comply by not paying or not agreeing to prison time? What happens then?
Religion is shackles.

So would capitalism.

Jesus lived by the non aggression axiom.  He's an OG ancap.
Agreed.
One only has to look at the volumes of stories from Jesus to see he espoused the ideology known today as libertarianism
"The Golden Rule ( pretty much the motto of Libertarians )
Thrift ( The parable of the Lost Coin )
Entrepreneurship ( The parable of the Hidden Treasure )
The Productive Use of Capital ( The Parable of Talents )
Negotiation of Debts ( The Parable of the Unjust Steward )
Respect of Other's Property ( The Parable of The Faithful Servant )
Freedom of Association/Contract ( The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard )"

"Jesus was the original Socialist.  What more have I need to do?  ""Sell all that you have and give it to the poor."""
"Yeah, he wasn't just a socialist, he was a communist."
I think the objection is to where Jesus would have forced others to obey his dictums.  As they say--conversion or coercion?  
​
"He never said ""Sell all that you have......or I will put a gun to your head and send you to prison."""
"<a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A1-11&amp;version=KJV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A1-11&amp;version=KJV</a>"
Looks like you're wrong.
"Nah, Peter was always a hothead.  Peter cut dude's ears off, denied Christ, etc etc. etc. --I hardly think that's an argument for Jesus supporting maiming people.  I dig Peter, but I don't worship him.  "
But I sincerely appreciate you taking my argument seriously and offering a Biblical answer to it.  
"We can duel with NT quotes, but let me ask you: do you feel Jesus would accept coercion.  Not Peter, but Jesus.  If you can coerce a person to pay taxes, why not coerce them to accept the kingdom of heaven?"
​
My contribution to the duel:
I think Jesus was a rebellious revolutionary.  He hated the leadership of his time and he frequently called the rich out for not helping the poor.  He took ears of corn from a farmer on the Sabbath without asking (some claim the law permitted him to do so at the time so it wasn't theft).  He proclaimed that his apostles would be taken care of by God and that they didn't need more than a single coat or any money.
Jesus was not anti-violent against money changers.  He didn't like the Roman occupancy of Israel.  His followers were quite radical.  Jesus himself said he didn't come to bring peace but the sword.
"Jesus himself said a rich man isn't very likely at all to get into heaven.  In his kingdom, all were meant to be equal in possessions for the most part."
"There are forms of force that aren't violent.  There are forms of coercion that aren't violent.  People are coerced by biology to breath, eat, drink, sleep, etc.  If God has made man, he has coerced man to do that which he must and no man can refuse that coercion or else he dies.  Biology is used against people.  The sensation of pain is God made if you believe God made man.  Pain is one of the primary tools of cercion."
"The Old Testament is full of genocide, slaughter, plagues, and severe punishment.  God ordered Moses to kill someone for picking up firewood on the Sabbath.  Unless Jesus was in open rebellion to God (which isn't what any Christian denomination teaches), then Jesus was ok with the events of the Old Testament."
"Personally, I think people are people and that if there is a divinity, he has no part in human affairs.  If there is a divinity, he/she's left humans alone to figure things out on their own.  Jesus' beliefs shaped the world for the better, that I believe, but the deity nature of him I don't believe.  Most of the stuff in Christianity is the result of people who claimed things after the fact.  Very probably Jesus was just another revolutionary martyr that was turned into deity by his followers after he was killed."
"No, the context of that quote is that they thought back then that God blessed righteous men with riches."
Thus the rich man thought his salvation secure.
It has nothing to do with denouncing being rich necessarily. Other places he denounces those who get rich dishonestly.
"You cannot buy salvation, you need a savior--he convincing then they need a savior, which was not part of Jewish doctrine at that time."
"""Sell all that you have and give it to the poor."""
the context of that quote is that they thought back then that God blessed righteous men with riches. Thus the rich man thought his salvation secure. It has nothing to do with denouncing being rich necessarily.
Notice how you didn't mention the poor at all? 
Jesus said clearly that you must give everything you own to the less fortunate as if they were Jesus himself. 
"""context"" includes the actual sentence you are discussing."
"Jesus lived in a time before capitalism and socialism. It's safe to say he wasn't a socialist because he logically couldnt have been something that didn't exist. But he certainly wasn't a capitalist like this lobbying organization says lol, and the scripture backs that up. "
"Matthew 6:24-""No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."" "
"Luke 12:15-""Then he said to them, 'Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.'” "
"Jesus's messages are about abandoning greed and devotion to God, championing the abandonment of materialism and being outwardly concerned for the needs of others. That's not capitalism (or socialism) as I understand it."
Jesus lived in a time before Capitalism?
​
"No, my man, no.  There are a lot of arguments you can make, but this just isn't one of them.  Capitalism was alive and well in the Roman empire and as far as we can gather from all advanced civilizations we have financial evidence on."
Jesus lived in a time before capitalism 
Capitalism is simply the voluntary exchange of goods and services between individuals.  It includes both direct barter and the use of money.  
Its as old as the human race itself.
Capitalism is simply the voluntary exchange of goods and services between individuals. It
No. Capitalism is built around the development of capital (industry).
""" Capital (Industry)"" "
​
What do you mean?  That capitalism requires the existence of modern (say-post 1800's) industrial means?  
​
"Capitalism is the phenomenon of privately owned means of production--the goat you own, the hands you pick fruit with, the sweat of your body--and their use for profit.  Like trading a baby goat you own for a bushel of grain your neighbor harvested.  In 5000 BC"
Capitalism is an economical system arriving from the industrial revolution. Prior to that elements existed but historically it did not.
Your definition is circular.  Capitalism is capital.
Capital is simply access production.  
Have surplus wheat?  Thats capital.
Exchange that surplus wheat for a precious metal that stores better.  Thats capital.
"Capitalism is based on private ownership with use of wage labor to accrue profit as a form of capital accumulation. That didn't exist 2000 years ago outside of big cities such as Rome where people could afford to focus on business (not to mention the Roman state's HUGE reliance on grain welfare for its citizens in Rome but that's besides the point), let alone in ancient Judea. There wasn't even usually currency being used here. This was still very much communal subsistence agriculture that isn't about profit. The tool maker makes tools so the farmer/fisherman can get food to feed the village to pay the miner to get the iron to make more tools. Everyone either gets food in return for their services or is directly involved with the production of food. "
"When Jesus is talking about greed, he's talking about those who have more than they need at the expense of those that do not. Having more than you need is the part that makes it capitalism."
That didn't exist 2000 years ago outside of big cities such as Rome where people could afford to focus on business
So it did exist.  WTF are you even arguing?
The article states that Jesus wasn't a socialist and his teachings line up with capitalist teachings instead. That's even more incorrect than calling him a socialist. I called it out as such.
Capitalism is based on <strong>private ownership</strong>
Existed since forever
with use of wage labor 
Wage labor is simply the exchange of labor for something else of value.
Existed since forever
to accrue profit as a form of capital accumulation
Profit is simply the excess of what you produced from that for which you bartered for.
"That too, has existed since forever."
Private ownership doesn't exist without an entity (state) acknowledging you own it.
How does your private property fare in feudalism?
"Private ownership is the only form of ownership until the state exists to deprive the individual of it.  The fundamental unit of capitalism is the body of the free individual.  If you believe freedom is conferred by the state then we have a political issue, not an economic one. "
​
"Feudalism is a social system, not an economic one.  And capitalism was rampant during European feudal times."
"Yes it does and did exist. You only need law in communities larger than Dunbar's number to have property protection, social pressure is enough in small societies."
Private ownership doesn't exist without an entity (state) acknowledging you own it.
"False.  A state may involve itself in settling or regulating private property, but it is not needed."
Source:  The founding of the entire US.  Private property predated the formation of civil governments.
The US got colonized by agents of royal governments. Then the US government used the military to expand westward and issued land grants and deeds. 
"You've defined capitalism so broadly that literally everything is capitalism. Do you think nomadic tribes of hunter gatherers were capitalists, too? The fuedalists must have been capitalists, right? They held land as property and demanded rents."
The US got colonized by agents of royal governments. Then the US government used the military to expand westward and issued land grants and deeds.
"Yes, the initial colonies.  But the expansion west was ahead of a state. "
See the American frontier
"No, that is <strong>personal property</strong> and it can easily be taken away from you."
Private property <strong>does not exist</strong> without a state.
"They literally staked out land, and declared it their own.  And defended it as such."
That is private property.  With no state.
"No, it's fucking <strong>personal property</strong>. Who is upholding their ownership once it is taken over by feudal lords?"
Personal property is that which is derived from land or labor.  The land itself is not personal property.  Even the marxists know this.
Who is upholding their ownership once it is taken over by feudal lords?
The fact that private property can be infringed upon by an aggressor is irrelevant.  Even the State takes peoples property all of the time through eminent domain.
"Does human freedom exist without the state?  Human autonomy?  If--this will be awkward, but indulge me--one free human trades physical safety (the labor of their free body) in return for the labor of another free human (it can be whatever--cooking, sexual access, a cool story, whatever) does that require the involvement of the state?"
Private property does not exist without a state.
Can you post a source please for this statement?
Private ownership doesn't exist without an entity (state) acknowledging you own it.
Can you post a source please for this statement?
Capitalism has nothing to do with wage labor.  You've selected a very narrow expression of Capitalism.  
Capitalism is simply the economic analog of human freedom.  That has existed for millennia.  Despite the periodic inconveniences it causes.
You're incorrect.  No economist carries the point of view that capitalism is free trade in markets.  It's not at all the analog of human freedom.  Capitalism is the system where ownership takes precedence over all else.  Slaves are owned in capitalism and capitalism has no problem with it.
How do you think feudalism worked?
"No, capitalism is isn't trade.  Capitalism is the amassing of capital as the primary objective of human existence.  It's absolutely imperative for more and more stuff to be collected under capitalism; it requires expansion of the market at all times or it fails.  The idea that humans exist to obtain stuff is capitalistic.  That's not as old as the human race and many ideologies have been opposed to it.  Communism doesn't believe the main point of human existence is to obtain stuff.  The vast majority of philosophers have a bad taste of capitalism as it is pretty ugly when critiqued.  "
Don't ever believe that free market based trade is capitalism; it isn't at all.
"Humans do exist to obtain stuff.  Water. Food. Shelter. Love. Without that ""stuff"" our genes can't be passed on and to the extent that human existence has a purpose, the transmission of genetic data is that purpose."
That fundamental drive--and the freedom to pursue it--is the basis of Capitalism.  
You've chosen a very narrow definition of Capitalism that arose within the past 200 years.  Of course that narrow definition doesn't make much sense applied to events 2000 years ago.
"Capitalism isn't about that which is necessary to survive.  Capitalism requires increasing demand to infinity.  Capitalism didn't really exist prior to the 1700's and Adam Smith.  Before modern economics, everything was feudalistic in nature for the most part.  During the time of Christ, it wasn't capitalism at all.  Capitalism isn't defined by markets."
I think we'll have to let Jesus decide the issue for us.  I'll pray on it and let you know what the outcome is.

"The PM still has the ultimate say, since it's an executive matter.  But given that he recommended voting yes to the parliament, its not a stretch to think he will follow through."
Its not binding until the guy who wrote it signs it. Any reason to think the guy wouldn't sign his own legislation?
Presumably Mexico will pay for it.
"If we win, we can get Iran to pay for it. With oil."
This didn't really work out in Iraq.
It's also a war crime.
How about neither are funded?
Nah we definitely need a basic healthcare program. US healthcare prices are skyrocketing and strangling people into bankruptcy.
"No Libertarian solution I have ever heard would make this terrible situation better and the solutions found by literally every other modern nation, though flawed, greatly improve upon the failing US healthcare system."
You don't think removing a government-granted monopoly on drugs would end high drug prices?
"It's not just about the drugs. It's predatory for-profit insurance companies. They have co-pays, deductibles, and at any possible chance will deny claims to save money. When insurance companies compete the only people who benefit are the healthy, but the sick pay heavily."
For example the last 10 years I have been paying for my insurance and never used it. Recently I moved cross country and went without insurance for a few months. Naturally I developed a growth that had to be removed. A quick visit to the dermatologist and -$500 dollars later I think to myself... what did I spend the past 10 years paying for? Why is my health controlled by my employer?
"My friend once passed out (medical reasons, long story) and someone called him an ambulance. He was rushed to the ER and his life was saved... His insurance refused to pay for any of it because the hospital they rushed him to an out of network hospital. He has to go through bankruptcy now because there's no way he can pay off the ridiculous fees. He also (now) has diabetes which on top of his massive insurance payments has multiple thousands in deductibles and co pays he has to deal with every year."
"Another friend has a child with some kind of immune-deficiency. She has to fight with her insurance company every week to ensure her child can have the life saving medication required to live a full, normal life. She has had to hire a lawyer to ensure she can get the healthcare she pays for."
"Government isn't perfect but at least they <em>sometimes</em> aren't for profit. Insurance companies are <em>always</em> for profit. I get Libertarians think companies are their best friend or... something but clearly this system isn't working. We have probably 30 other healthcare models worldwide that work so instead of putting our head in the sand yelling ""no govt and taxes bad"" we could actually work towards a system that works for the people instead of for profit."
"Uh huh, and why is the price so high?"
"Is it because of occupational licencing, medical regulations, Obamacare driving up prices, corporate lobbying for more regulations restricting competition in healthcare?"
Or is it the evil capitalists again?
"occupational licencing, medical regulations"
I.e. stuff that keeps quack doctors and snake oil salesmen from scamming and hurting people.
Obamacare driving up prices
"Obamacare has been so thoroughly gutted by Republican sabotage that it's ridiculous to call it responsible for much of anything.  Maybe the only lasting, universal part of it was prohibiting insurance companies from dropping people due to pre-existing conditions.  "
corporate lobbying for more regulations restricting competition in healthcare
The free market ain't going to end lobbying.
Well ending the government will end corporate lobbying? What are you on about?
ending the government will end corporate lobbying
"By handing tremendous amounts of power to the corporations doing the lobbying in the first place, yes.  One of many reasons why anarchism is stupid."
Or.. we could have a government which only serves to protect natural rights? And to seek restitution after a crime has been committed.
"Corporate lobbying is the fault of government, not corporations. If the government clearly stated that no regulations would be passed, no subsidies given out, and no prohibitions on products instated, then corporations wouldn't spend time lobbying."
"Instead, you get what we have now, where corporations, themselves enjoying legal privileges only granted by the government, can lobby for changes in regulation to limit competition and enhance their profits, subsidies, and prohibitions on things like drugs (which directly helps private prisons, and police)."
"Yeah that's fair, a lot of those things do drive up prices. I agree changes can be made in system to alleviate the issues but this only helps the symptoms, not the core US healthcare problem."
"These insurance companies are still for profit. Many of the issues I just said have nothing to do with the price, but due to all the technicalities healthcare insurance suckle off to avoid paying out. In fact every single issue I just described has nothing to do with pricing, but how the insurance companies are predators."
It doesn't matter what rules and regulations you use to prevent insurance companies from victimizing people (as a Libertarian you probably support relaxing regulations on these companies anyway). They will find any loophole they can exploit. That's just how competition works.
But healthcare is a basic human need. The system doesn't work.

Cold War + Reaganism + Koch Bros
"That's how you get the current Libertarian movement. Anarcho capitalism, racism under the guise of liberty (repealing the CRA), communism/socialism obsession, etc."
What's held this movement together has been opposing Communism during the Cold War but now we've left that era. That's why everything is being called communist/socialist now because the actual threat is gone.

Okay first fuck going to war with Iran. Secondly however this time we are going to war with a nation not an ideology so saying its unwinnable is not smart. 
Thirdly paying for it with our grandchildren's money has been the answer for the past 20 years
this time we are going to war with a nation not an ideology so saying its unwinnable is not smart.
"Iraq was a nation.  A much smaller nation -- by population and land area -- with more favorable geography, with a more secular government, with a less advanced military."
"Any suggestion that a war with Iran is winnable, in any meaningful sense of the word, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/ejgyoq/bernie_sanders_war_in_iran_would_be_bigger/fcz8vc6/"">is insane.</a>"
We werent really at war with iraq under bush 2. We were with bush 1 and bush 1 did Good. Bush 2 was at war with the taliban which was an ideology.
This is so laughably off base I don't even know where to start.
"""Why is nobody talking about how murder is wastefully expensive?"""
"Because the people against it are busy using much stronger arguments already, silly."
"When there are thousands of articles written on the same topic you'd expect at least one to talk about the price tag, if only by dumb luck.  You'd also think if you're trying to appeal to as many people as possible you'd throw out as many objections as possible, and a multi-trillion dollar cost is certainly worth discussing.  "
"""It's expensive"" is part of the death penalty debate, too, so it's not as if having a moral argument against something precludes having a financial argument against it."
More from NYT:
"His victory was expected, as the opposition controls the legislative body, but at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó from entering the assembly’s white-walled building. Inside, a member of Mr. Maduro’s party, Héctor Agüero, swore in Luis Parra as head of the assembly. There was no vote count."

Polycentric law
What is it?
"<a href=""https://fee.org/articles/what-is-polycentric-law//amp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fee.org/articles/what-is-polycentric-law//amp</a>"
negative rigths would have to be handled by the state. Positive rigths would have to be handled by private law.
What do you mean by that?
"The state should create a law system that deals with stuff like murder, thievery, rape, violence, spying, etc..."
"For a private law system, the state would have to register what person recognizes what court for how long and whats the maximum amount of punishment allowed. The private law system would deal with stuff like relationships, sport and work contracts, copyrigths, nda and could even deal with negative rigth violations."
A good thing about the dual system would be that the state can copy what the private system does in future reforms.
Probably with a social contract and pigs with sticks.
is there another way?
Laws protecting individual rights and courts to adjudicate them are valid roles of government.
Justice goes to those who can afford it.
My question is: who would manage justice?
The state for most Libertarians.
Private adjudicators according to anarcho capitalists and their ilk.
Because that couldn't possibly go wrong
"I see, thanks!"
Weird discussion what’s there to discuss fuck nazis!

Weren't they already targeting every American in the region?
I was about to ask how this was different?
"Yes, but now they will strenuously target them"
"No, they were not."
All the American deaths were natural causes then?
"Only 1 American died in Iraq in 2019 due to hostile actions, the rest were accidents or other non-combat related deaths and it wasn't Hezzbollah that killed him"
What American deaths?
Every single US soldier in a foreign country needs to be sent home and their bases closed. I’m tired of my tax dollars going to this useless bullshit that makes people hate the US more.
So it's business as usual then
"The question isn't whether Soleimani deserved to die, its whether the blow back from such action will be worth it."
If Soleimani deserved to die then wouldn't most American military and intelligence officials deserve to die?
One mans terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. And so its been since time immemorial.
Exactly.
From the perspective of a Jihadi yes
Why just a jihadi?
Because including the whole hate America crowd is unwieldy and not relevant.
"How is the aggression by the US not relevant? We've killed over a million people in Iraq. Our military and intelligence officials toppled the Iranian government, funded and backed a war that killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians, sanctioned the country... But Soleimani, an Iranian general deserves to die while Americans don't? That's fundamentally absurd on every level."
"Yeah but we're us and they're them, its different"
So Jihadis?

Yep
"Who knows, but I don't think it will be a conventional attack."
"Yup people keep talking about WWIII, but more realisticly it's probably going to be more public funding of terrorism."
people are memeing about WW3
The question should also be did Iraq want the US to do it.  
This was the USA bombing in another country with the person being from a third country.  If Saudi did this people would be going crazy.   America does it it's debabtle.
So you believe that people should be immune from all punishment for their crimes so long as the 'blowback' from that punishment is worse than their crime?  In that case Trump supporters threatening civil war if he's removed is a logical strategy. We can't remove him if the blowback results in violent mobs of his supporters hurting or killing people.
So you believe that people should be immune from all punishment for their crimes so long as the 'blowback
"I think, at a minimum, it needs to be weighed."
"If they could credibly threaten that, then yes that would absolutely be taken into consideration. But they cant, so the strategy of not taking it into account makes more sense. So it's kind if a moot point. If some murder flees to a foreign country, we dont fuck up our relationship with that country just to get the guy back."
As if Hezbollah would ever turn down an opportunity to kill Americans. Come on!
"Why are people so afraid of Iran's response? What, the west can no longer stand up for itself? Sounds like we're being extorted.  "
"Edit: yep, no one has an answer."
"Because they can still kill people, even if we get get them back 10 fold, people are still dead."
"If we don't show strength, they will kill people anyway. Islam has a very similar history as christianity, and islamic imperialism is a thing just as much as christian imperialism."
Remember when the media said during Desert Shield we'd suffer thousands of deaths from the elite Republican Guard of Iraq?  US could ruin Iran without ever having to step foot in their country.  Hopefully their populous will see their opening and start a civil war and kick these religious parasites out of power if they know their government is putting them in danger.

Due process?
A myth. As it always has been.
Such a high approval rate reflects the threat these laws pose to due process and the Second Amendment.
"No it doesn't. This is like the dumbest argument I've ever heard. Having such a high rate of success could mean it's only being used when it's required. They acknowledge in the report it will only be used 170 times in a year. The entire state of Colorado, and it's only 170 times in a year."
"Reason is essentially arguing that if Colorado implements a law like this, it's actually better for due process and better for the Second Amendment if the law is more encompassing and is used to bring more people into the court system who shouldn't be there in the first place."

Non interventionist doesnt mean isolationist. You can support people fighting a tyrannical government but you cant send troops basically. Kinda like France helping us in the revolutionary war. We fought. They gave us weapons and provided blockades.
So basically funding proxy wars?
I honestly wouldnt fund them just sell them what they need but if that's how you view it yes.
What if a foreign government requested troops on the ground to fight tyranny?
"Easiest answer, for me at least. Democracy still exists in a Libertarian nation. Not all Libertarians believe in exactly the same way. You would take a vote. Majority wins. Wether war or non-interference."
"People voting in non-libertarian ways doesn't represent libertarianism as an ideology though. People voting in authoritarianism in a libertarian democracy, doesn't make those choices libertarian."
"Didn't say they were. I'm assuming we would still be a republic with Representatives. That said, there are left/right leaning Libertarians. So to follow the rules of our country, majority vote dictates our decision. We don't have to agree with the decision, but ""should follow through with it"""
I think you’re getting libertarian and neo liberal confused
I thought neo-liberalism was basically what the current US establishment politicians generally support. Which is way too authoritarian.
Really good question and addresses the heart of the issue with recent events.
"The first thing you need to keep in mind is you can't say ""well what about X in a Libertarian country?""  If the country were truly Libertarian it would be structured MUCH differently so some of the situations you think of as ""norms"" wouldn't exist or would exist in a totally different matter.  So the first part of my reply is that in a Libertarian society there wouldn't be nearly as many ""poor people"" as we see today.  The second would be that individuals are still likely to be charitable.  We all have charities that we support, and you could still do that.  People can be as generous as they want with their own wealth, but having government run charities, which is what literally every social program is, has created more poverty."
You can you claim a libertarian society wouldn’t have as many individuals below the poverty line? That’s a very bold claim.
This is one of the Achilles heels of the libertarian ideology.

"“I am for doing good to the poor, but...I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.

And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.”"

I dont wish to live in a society where the government can at the end of the sword take from one and give to another upon the demand of equity of outcome. No kindness comes from the government doing such a thing. Kindness is you taking a little of what you have and sharing it of your own free will. Without voluntary action, we’re slaves. "
"Look at the numbers of people going on foodstamps versus the people going off foodstamps. The number has been increasing disproportionately to the population. Foodstamps was introduced in the 1970’s. Initial numbers had 17-18 million people using them. Currently that number is more than double that. The US population has not doubled since that point in time. If the social net has the purpose of getting people off of foodstamps, the number should have decreased. Instead it appears it has been used as suplimentary income to those in poverty, stagnating them. This service should not exist.It creates a dependant class of people who cannot survive without outside aid, rather than empower people to become self sufficient members of society."
Foodstamps was introduced in the 1970’s. Initial numbers had 17-18 million people using them. Currently that number is more than double that. The US population has not doubled since that point in time. 
I'll suggest you look at the lack of change in real wages during this time. A significant number of people on food stamps are working.
"That said, we will likely continue to disagree because you have a much more hostile view of the state than I do. Which is fair, but will lead us in very different directions. Private charity has never in history been equal to the needs of the poor, so yes, I am fine with the 'tyranny' of taking a pittance from everyone to make sure the poor don't starve to death."
I dont like the government’s track record with attempts at engineering equity. I would hope that you reconsider other means to help the poor before turning to the government to do so on your behalf.

"Also, you failed how the issue of poverty in the US isn't an Achilles heel for the Libertarian ideology. In other words, you failed how the Libertarian ideology would take care of this specific issue."
"University enrollment is hardly a desirable goal. Currently our young people should be avoiding colleges and seeking education using the internet unless attempting doctorates, engineering, etc. Higher education simply for its own sake is a foolish suggestion. "
"Perhaps you are unaware that we have actually done exactly the opposite of what Franklin suggested. We had a myriad of public safety nets provided by the government. The worse the poverty is in an area, almost like clockwork, it can be tied to the government kicking the agency out from under the poor. “We will provide you free housing here, but you must do X, Y, and Z to continue using said housing.” “We will provide for your children, you must do X, Y, Z” “We will provide you food, if you do X, Y, Z” all of which is dependant on the individuals in question remaining in an impoverished state. These systems, while to some may merely be a stepping off point, to many more become perminant lifestyle habitations that will then be inflicted upon their children, with no escape, because they never learn how to become independant. Now, thats not to say you cant turn to your neighbor to ask for a helping hand, but if you ask your government, you invite yourself into serfdom."
"Seriously? University enrollment is hardly a desirable goal? According to who? Hundreds of thousands of students who are willing to strive for a better life are enrolling and graduating just so they can get a decent job, usually a white-collar one. And avoiding colleges? Just so they can scare employers? Just so they can get a mediocre low-paying job and take the risks of student debt, healthcare costs, and other lasting financial issues?"
"2) ""Perhaps you are unaware that we have actually done exactly the opposite of what Franklin suggested."""
"You're more concerned with following the flawed ideals of an old man that can be easily proven wrong than actually carrying out practical solutions of the modern-day, which have substantial evidence. Just to let you know, the Founding Fathers were sometimes politically incompetent, like Thomas Jefferson and his initial intentions to prioritize agriculture over industry, and cannot always be treated as if they're divine idols."
"3) ""These systems, while to some may merely be a stepping off point, to many more become perminant lifestyle habitations that will then be inflicted upon their children, with no escape, because they never learn how to become independant. """
"Can you provide an actual piece of evidence of this instead of going off at some ideals? Low-income Americans are over-working their asses yet they can't afford decent education, healthcare, or nutrition."
"2.) The “Old Man” was one of the founders of a country that went on to become the most powerful nation on the entire planet. Perhaps you shouldnt be so swift to discard the ideas that formed that foundation as if they were flawed. People unaware of history often realize that these discussions we have right now are the same ones they had back then, and going back again and again, dating back to the Greek Republics and further still. Thomas Jefferson favored individual agency over anything else, and came from an agrarian background, which dictated his stances. Between him and Hamilton, Jefferson was more correct. Jefferson was not politically incompetant. He sought to limit the scope of government to protect the agency of individuals. He largely achieved that goal. His political rivals did not achieve theirs."
"3.) To specifically use Foodstamps, the percentage of the population using foodstamps has not decreased since the time of its introduction. it has in fact, increased. Roughly 8% of the population was on foodstamps in 1975, and presently 12% (or as of 2018) is on foodstamps today. If the intention of the system is to reduce the number of people on foodstamps, then it has failed that goal entirely. It has had roughly 40 years to show results, and has failed to do so. Over the lifetime of the system, it has never dropped below 8% of the population, showing that it had never worked to reduce the percentage of people using it. Thats just one government system that I chose to use as an example. These numbers are as the government themselves reports. here is a <a href=""http://www.trivisonno.com/food-stamps-charts"" rel=""nofollow"">link </a> to the information I’m referring to."
"You really don't understand. A white-collar job is far better at securing financial survival than a blue-collar job. One, you won't be easily subject to workplace injuries that you'll carry on with the rest of your life. Two, you're less likely to be replaced physical exhaustion puts a toll on your aging body and health. Three, of course, automation. Four, most importantly, you're easily able to take care of glaring needs, such as healthcare, especially as you get older. And those are only a few things a white-collar job can effectively provide and what a blue-collar job effectively cannot. This is what students are taking the risk of student debt for, and their jobs after graduation pays off."
"2) No shit that Franklin was a Founding Father. The point here is that accepting everything a significant figure believes in and disregarding the flaws behind those beliefs is logically wrong. Some of the Founding Fathers initially liked the heavy decentralization of the Articles of Confederation, which fucked things up and convinced them to write the US Constitution as a replacement."

The purpose of SNAP or the American food stamps is to provide food-purchasing assistance for millions of low-income Americans so they don't starve and die. It was not designed to reduce the number of people who can't afford food. Financial inability to afford food comes from poverty. SNAP was not meant to reduce poverty but to provide a safety net to combat starvation. I should also mention that the commonly-accepted idea behind the increase in food stamp usage is because of the increasing poverty rates responsible by slashed programs and heavy deregulation by certain administrations.

"You're aware of the successful anti-poverty campaigns under LBJ, right?"
If I wanted to spend the day going over how LBJ was the evilest sack of shit to ever hold office I’d be here till 2021.
The beatings will continue until morale improves!
always makes me laugh
That is literally a “pick yourself up by the bootstraps” kind of statement. It’s basically saying the poor can escape poverty by not being poor. The purpose of welfare is to provide a safety net for those who struggle so they can get back on their feet. Many of these people in poverty have unreliable jobs or they can’t work at all due to disability. 
"I’m not saying welfare is the answer, but I know that no welfare <em>isn’t</em> the answer."
I’m saying government wellfare isnt the answer.
If you want to help take care of someone; you help take care of them. Why do you need someone else to take your money and redistribute it for you?  Take some responsibility for your own actions
Okay. Let's say for example I take my entire income and spend whatever is left after necessities on donating it to people without the ability to pay for medical care. I barely make a dent.
"Now what? I may have helped a small number of people, but there are still people without access to medical care."
"Don't worry, as of right now they cannot be turned away for care at the local ER. And all the money you pay into medical bills will cover their coats...."
Can they turn you away for routine appointments if you can't pay? Can they turn you away for medical screenings if you can't pay? Can they refuse to provide medication to you if you cannot pay?
"If you answered ""yes"", then congratulations! You still don't have medical care."
So the libertarian solution is to get the services and skip out on the bill?
Nope. That's the socialist system. AKA the way it is right now
So what exactly is the solution you proposed above? 
"Go to the ER, get service, get bill that you can't pay... What's next?"
Personally I believe we should bring back indentured servitude
"What, do you expect a person who wishes to alleviate his friends' lack of financial access to education and healthcare to fix it on an individual scale? I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but people support government intervention and taxes under the belief that common issues like the ones that I've mentioned will be effectively addressed on a national scale with more financial resources available."
"2) ""Take some responsibility for your own actions."""
"Tell it to a poor working-class American who has to sit back and watch himself die from a lack of healthcare. Around 50,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of medical access. What do you have to say to them? I don't think you realize this, but the average wages a low-income American earns isn't enough to afford decent and widely-accepted insurance. And they need help. Fast."
then lets get rid of insurance.  Why do we need to keep heading down the same road that caused the problems.  Lets go back the other way and get the actual costs down so people can afford it.
I day that you should get govt out of healthcare and watch costs go down. 
"If you want to help people, do it locally or through a charity built for a specific event"
"1) ""I day that you should get govt out of healthcare and watch costs go down."""
"One, please elaborate your stance. Two, if the government leaves alone healthcare, that means millions of poor Americans won't have decent, stable coverage. The only option left for them is an insurance the majority of hospitals and medical specialists won't accept. And that means leaving them to be sick or die."
"2) ""If you want to help people, do it locally or through a charity built for a specific event"""
"You really don't get the point. Listen, I've already participated and continue to do so in numerous charities focused on medical care and related needs. The entire purpose of this discussion is to talk about the effectiveness of government intervention in tackling poverty because its far more effective than on an individual scale."
If you want to help take care of someone; you help take care of them.
"Sorry kid, I have something called ""working my ass of for a living"" going on."
Take some responsibility for your own actions
"Richfags first. As long as my charity is used for letting the rich save their money, charity will be not only immoral, but straight up retarded thing to do."
"Please reconsider your post, and next time post something a bit more coherent."
"If you work your ass off and feel no desire to help others, don't. No big deal."
"If you donate to a charity that does not agree with your ideals, you are the one doing it. That said, if you are talking about the taxation and medical costs, then what is wrong with you only paying for your own care instead of anyone else's?"
"You act as if its only giant sweeping companies that exist to solely appeal to the middle class. Charity organizations as well as those that are for profit create services for those with less regularly. If capitalism has proven anything, it can take what was previously considered a luxury and make it a household item that you can hardly imagine going without. Heating and cooling, cars, television, radios, fresh food, etc. The poor in places like the west are so well taken care of that people flock to those countries in the hundreds of thousands. "
"Poor people are merely upon hard times, and will eventually come out of it. You must make chronic bad life choices for decades to remain poor for your whole life. The reason why the libertarian viewpoint is against social wellfare nets is that too often people will become dependant upon them, and never achieve self-sufficiency. Observe the “Do not feed the bears sign” partially for the camper’s own good- but mostly for the bear. If it becomes wholely dependant upon the camper for food, it will no longer be capable of hunting. We imagine people are somehow more capable than animals, but generally, we arent. We too will take the easier path every time. Life is hardship. We come screaming into this world through great effort and pain, and in  previous generations- often death. Through allowing for the maximum possible freedom for individuals to choose their own life’s choices, it has culminated in people creating more advances in technology than previously ever in all of human history. This was possible by what creates the wealth of nations, the individual. You cannot lump people into classes, groups, races, GENERALIZATIONS, and then attempt to coerce a lifestyle, to create a desired outcome. There are too many variables in life for that to ever be possible. You can either make people as free as possible, to own their own victories and mistakes, or through great tyranny create a secured system with very little change."
"In the hypothetical Libertarian society mentioned, giant companies will dominate regardless of the circumstances because of their massive wealth. They'll purchase as much as they can just to develop a monopoly. Additionally, corporations will only cater to consumers, such as company workers or simply buyers, only if there's profit. As shown by modern-day situations, companies have no interest in appealing to the lower-class because there's no substantial profit in doing so."
"2) Charity organizations are clearly not enough to fill in the deep gaps of poor nutritional, education, health, and other significant needs of near-impoverished Americans. Additionally, handing the role of welfare to voluntary action results to lack of accountability, and history proves this well."
"3) ""If capitalism has proven anything, it can take what was previously considered a luxury and make it a household item that you can hardly imagine going without. """
"What it hasn't done is effectively address the lasting issues of poor access to education, healthcare, and other needs I've already mentioned above."
"4) ""Poor people are merely upon hard times, and will eventually come out of it."""
"In the past decades, we've had the 70s recession, 80s corporation expansion, 90s dotcom boom, and the 08 recession. In that period of time, drug prices have only rose, student debt and college tuition grew rapidly, food bank reliance has barely changed, and the low-income continues to remain with their issues."
"5) ""The reason why the libertarian viewpoint is against social welfare nets is that too often people will become dependant upon them, and never achieve self-sufficiency."""
"Except the idea that people will become too dependent on social welfare nets is false and pretty much an urban myth. Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Britain have an extreme variety of social welfare nets, such as cheap healthcare, yet their productivity rates, employment rates, and GDP remain either stable or growing. The same can be said for Americans who benefitted from Obama's healthcare reforms and tax cuts."
"6) ""You cannot lump people into classes, groups, races, GENERALIZATIONS, and then attempt to coerce a lifestyle, to create a desired outcome. """
Never desired that.
"Education is currently the cheapest it has ever been, and you and I have access to it. The Internet, the means in which we are presently communicating, also has all the information with which to learn anything, on any subject that you care to learn about. Reading, writing, language, mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, philosophy, religion, political sciences, hobbies, technical skills. All free after the cost of admission, which is so low that any person in the western world has access to it. "
"Britain is a country where people are arrested for words. They are not an example to follow. I’m fairly certain the same can be said of every country on that list. I certainly dont want the government, reknowned for government organizations as well run as the post office, and with compassionate agents like the IRS, running my ability to access lifesaving medicine any more than they already do. I would stand to see them remove their regulatory bodies that restrict that marketplace."
"Since the 70’s, we’ve seen the greatest expansion of government social wellfare nets than ever before in this nation’s history. We’ve seen tens of thousands of regulations written to restrict businesses, ultimately damaging or even destroying the possibility of entry into the marketplace in many fields. One such noticable field is medicine, the result everyone has noticed, but few have been capable in identifying the cause. The medical field is so heavily restricted that it is next to impossible to start a company for the intention of creating and distributing medicine. People’s individual agency to act in benefiting the general public has been damaged by government interference. Regarding again the social wellfare nets, we’ve seen the percentage of the population that is no longer self-sufficient rise since the introduction of those nets were introduced. I would not see entire swaths of the American economy nationalized in the name of equity of outcome, certainly not with its track record. "
"That companies dont make products or look out for the poor is an absolute lie. Businesses are formed specifically to provide services to those in need. The poor are those most in need, and still have resources and agency to addess problems. Businesses sell solutions and services to solve problems. There are also a myriad of non-for-profit businesses that exist as well, for the purpose of helping those in need. Many small businesses will not turn massive profits, and will break little better than even many years, and actively provide goods and services to those that need them, all of people’s own good will. If you believe that companies dont go out of their way to help people in need is to entirely fail to even try and find them. At best its irresponsible, but at worst its malicious."
I don't think you get the point. People want to enroll in universities and graduate because they want those nice degrees to get a safe job. There's enough statistics out there to show that companies sway away from candidates without college degrees during employe selection. Cheap costs of education on the internet is not relevant to the issue we're discussing.
"2) ""Britain is a country where people are arrested for words. They are not an example to follow."""

"6) ""That companies dont make products or look out for the poor is an absolute lie."""
"The companies only care about profit because, of course, that's what they're meant to do, and, for that reason, obviously, they sell products, such as greasy hamburgers, to them. What they don't do is provide decent sewage, sanitation, infrastructure, accessible education, and other actual necessary resources, human needs that the government can effectively and easily provide."
"7) ""There are also a myriad of non-for-profit businesses that exist as well, for the purpose of helping those in need."""
"Repeating what I said to another guy in this comment section, those non-profit-businesses are ineffective at tackling these issues. The government is far more effective and reliable because of its financial resources, national influence, and accountability and needed to provide social welfare for that reason."
"Can you tell me one government agency that is more cost efficient then a religious charity? I would say all charities but some NGOs like Greenpeace spends 78% on campaigns and fundraising costs. Not knocking it since I still am a member, but not a efficient way of helping the poor, that's why I volunteer, since time is important."
"Efficiency isn't the only measure of success. Universality, predictability, and portability are all things that government can claim that private enterprise cannot."

"I not the government helped my 45 year homeless brother get dentures, a home, a job, a phone, and hes working on his GED. He was homeless for 25 years, and I'm prouder than shit of him. He chose to live on the streets because he was not allowed to drink and do drugs in shelters. He would get about 50 bucks a day in handouts for booze and food. He transferred is addiction, which he still has for weed. He can smoke legally now which allows him to function, without drinking. I volunteer at my shelter and have helped others, but it's a lifestyle choice."
"Good on you, and great news for your brother. Seriously."
Please understand that a systemic approach to social services doesn't invalidate individual good works. And you yourself stated that your brother made a choice to not make use of public services (which is his right).
"Since I'm arguing that government intervention is good here, the few I'm listing doesn't have to be limited to agencies:"
"Religious charities are great but too small to make an effective or lasting impact like the interventions mentioned above. Government action, which is equipped with reliable financial resources, accountability, and national influence, is far better to make things happen."
NASA.
Why did NASA give up the shuttle program? For competition? They do have a great bang for the buck.
"Efficiency, dingus. The US economy has returned 7-14x the annual NASA budget from NASA tech- that pretty fucking efficient."
"How much has NASA made? They dont. My dad worked for a company that made a item that NASA needed. Hence, they have used thousands of contractor companies. I'm not knocking on NASA, because you can actually see the results with data. This topic is can the government solving homeless problem. Just ask us in California and LA."
So you're saying NASA is an efficient general contractor.
Yes they are..better than all others

What specifically would you like to know so that I am not wasting our time? In regards to taxation? Social responsibility? Morality? 
How most of these concepts could not work within our current government but are ideals worth working towards? 
"My brother, what would you like to know?"
"I don't know who taught you to communicate, but all you have to do is to present a single point and present some evidence. So, yes, add a few points about taxation, social responsibility, etc."
You are correct. I have opinions but am not very good at conveying amazingly complex concepts from my phone. My best advice would be to read a book about the subjects you have questions about. They probably can do a better job explaining then me. Im sure this sub has suggested many great libertarian books you could sort through. Good luck
"One, no one told you to do it all from your phone or rush your answer. You could've done it on a PC the next day."
"Two, if you don't want to bother explaining or arguing, then you may as well never posted any kind of response or participated in this conversation. You're kinda wasting time here."
Agreed. I just put the kids to bed and am going to hang out with the wife for a couple minutes before bed. I don’t have the ability to do what you are asking me to do. 
Happy hunting.
"Governments are a monopoly on violence. All things that they do is underlined by this. All systems they provide are backed by the sword. “You shall provide X, or you shall be inprisoned or die.” Because of this, the less responsibility and power we give them over our lives, the less the sword is involved. To voluntarily adopt the burdens of our neighbors, to share to them out of our bowl is a christian ideal, which is why it is to the church those of the liberal inheritance turn to when it comes to addressing those in poverty. It is voluntary. To do so at the end of a blade is by no means a free society is made."
"So your trade a government with a monopoly over violence in which you can directly participate, for what exactly? How do you protect your property without having to engage in regular violence?"
"From the viewpoint of a classical liberal, a minimum of goverment must exist for things such as the protection of property. A limitation of that government must be kept, least it grow from a necessary evil to an intolerable one. A liberal republic has a citizenry capable of violence, but they vest the authority to commit violence in the government as part of a social contract. Should the government violate that social contract, the citizenry has the capacity to revoke their consent to be governed, and reform a government that will respect their individual agency."
"You’re just repeating theories and philosophical statements. Those are all well and good but no battle plan survives contact with the enemy. And the part that doesn't survive contact with the real world, or at least the point that libertarians can’t seem to grasp on this sub in particular, is that individual liberty can only be maximized by maximizing group liberty when you’re actually living in a group. "
"If you have maximal liberty and most around you don’t then you may perceive that you have full liberty but it is over far fewer options and opportunities than if everyone were empowered, supported and had their own liberties maximized as well. "
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. The same holds true of liberty as well. If you want to feel the most liberty then fight for yourself. If you want to experience the most liberty then fight for that of others."
"Those ideas have made contact with the enemy and won. They outlasted the monarchies, and defeated the sons and daughters of communism in the 20th century. I am their inheritor, and will see them preserved in my lifetime. It is Liberalism, not any other lesser ideology, that will see us into the future."
Do you guys honestly have anything besides 1 sentence platitudes?
"No, they really don't. Then the people on this sub wonder why no one takes them seriously. Libertarians are a political meme."
"That propaganda and corruption filled institution? Jfc, learn to be skeptical of authority. "
"Also, positive externalizes would still be Pareto under produced."
Yeah Libertarian ideals fall apart if you think about them for longer than 30 seconds.
"No social programs or government restrictions on corporations leads to the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer. Monopolies form everywhere. This leads to corporations exploiting consumers and buying out available wealth. The middle class dies as does the very concept of competition. The poor have no safety net and resort to... honestly, fucking Somalia level desperation. Claiming private donations would be enough to lift fifty million people out of poverty... lol."
Libertarian is an economic model contrary to Authoritarianism. It isn't bad when taken on a spectrum. The real answer is somewhere in the middle. There's a reason no nation has ever been stupid enough to believe true Libertarianism could function as a government type.
"By public needs, I assume you mean things like public utilities. And last I checked, more customers meant more money. Someone will find an innovative method to bring access costs down or create cost-competitive alternatives."

Someone comparing what is happening to assange to Jesus Christ...birth.
"If that clarified anything, would you explain it to me."
I think he means easter. He is confusing his own holidays. Jesus wasnt martyred on christmas he was born. So... comparing the birth of someone to Assange is weird.
Think he used christmas because it was recently.
Let's try this with new years it was more recent: Look what is happening to Assange. They have conditioned you to comply with his martyrdom and New Years is your training
Does that work?

Since all of these policies are/were huge successes let’s outlaw guns next!
"The mindset of completely outlawing most substances/inanimate objects usually comes from a misguided moral standpoint, government corruption, and/or a scared/brainwashed public who willingly give up freedoms in order to ‘feel’ safe by ineffectual policies.

So now you trust the pentagon and intelligence agencies ?
"Yes, but actually no. They’ll trust them on this, but insist the entire Intelligence immunity is part of the Deep State."
Would you believe the Pentagon if they stated that the Russian Federation carried out a detailed systematic propaganda campaign to get Donnie elected in 2016 and to sow distrust among the American populace are still doing so to this day? 
Just purely a hypothetical

I have no idea how propaganda works.
At least you admit it.

Only idiots read Pentagon statements and accept them without independent verification.
There was no justification regardless. Trump just wants to get Iran to start a war
The attack on our embassy was sufficient justification. There are legions more.
And what does the killing of a general justify Iran in doing? They have a justification to kill a US ambassador now
They already did that.
"Fuck off, Soleimani had violated the NAP so fucking much, that he has no right to life at all.   "
From an actual libertarian perspective. I think anyone had the right to kill this fucker.
"I think many if not most politicians, law enforcement and military from that region could be justifiably killed under such a harsh interpretation of the NAP."
I just don't think it will make the situation any better.
"Yes, there are a lot of fucking murderous asshats out there, and many have violated the NAP to the extent that they are no longer protected by it."
"This isn't some radical interpretation of the NAP. The NAP literally involves the idea that if someone agresses upon you or someone else, you have the right to respond with rational force."
Iran attacked our embassy?
"Meh he was killed with a missile not up close with a blade so its not a ""true"" assassination. /s"
[deleted]
Im being sarcastic
"Evidence be damned, you don't assassinate high level officials of foreign governments at international airports."
If his crimes were so severe you take that shit to the UN.
"Yeah for real, arrest him then. He was at the Baghdad International Airport, he could have easily been detained by US or Iraqi forces."
And what would the UN do about it?
Would they use force?
Or just stern words?
"Lol.  You mean, like we did with Osama bin Laden?"
You are funny.
What government was Osama bin Laden a high level official of?
Was he a high level offical of a foreign government?
Had had planned and financed attacks on Americans in countries other than his own?
Did we bring him before the UN for judgment?
He isn't a high level official of a foreign government. So no
"Soleimani had violated the NAP so fucking much, in his life that he no longer had any claim to it."
"Following real libertarian principles, this guy had no right to life, and anyone should have been free to kill him."
"What makes you think the american public would be privy to the ""evidence""..."
What makes you think there is any?
"Remember, we should only trust the intelligence when it goes for Trump's ideas, not against him."
You mean other than all the Americans he's already killed and the embassy he attacked?
"The string of traded punches goes back decades, including a case where the US killed 300 civilian Iranians by shooting down a commercial Iranian passenger plane flying in Iranian airspace."
"There will always be such shallow justifications for war.  That very rarely means that more war is ethical, nor the best choice for our country."
Hot take.  
"All evil war mongers who have violated the NAP to such degrees as Soleimani and US generals, should all have no right to protection under the ideas of the NAP.  "
"They are all fuckers. Who cares what ""side"" they are on.   "
"I can't beleive how stupid people are around here, how do you not put 2 and 2 together to mean that Both US and Iranians should be punished."
We aren't going to war
"Maybe, maybe not.  We’ll see. "
We’re a whole hell of a lot more likely to go to war (again) now than before we cock-slapped both Iraq and Iran (again).
You do comprehend that killing this terrorist was retaliation for his actual acts of war right?
"Maybe he was retaliating for the Iranian commercial passenger plane flying in Iranian airspace that we blew up killing hundreds of people in ‘88.  Which was retaliation for US hostages taken by Iran.  Which was retaliation for, which was retaliation for, which was a retaliation for, and on and on."
We’ve fucked with Iran back and forth for a LONG time.  Participating in that cycle doesn’t make either side “right” or “good” in anyone’s eyes but the participants.  To everyone else they both look like dangerous murder-happy children with too much power.
"Yeah, we just used a military strike to kill one of their generals.  Who said anything about war?"
He wasn't just some general. He was the second ranking person in the country. He answered only to Khomeini.  You think Khomeini wants any of that?
"In my view, using the military to kill the military officials of another country IS an act of war.  Perhaps the target country will be too intimidated to fight back, but it's hard to know that in advance.  This reminds me of the attitude toward Obama overthrowing the government of Libya.  In both cases the president had an obligation to get approval from Congress."
Which embassy did he attack?
"This is the best tl;dr I could make, <a href=""https://reason.com/2020/01/04/absent-evidence-of-imminent-attack-on-americans-white-houses-justification-for-killing-iranian-general-collapses/"" rel=""nofollow"">original</a> reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)"
"The White House claims that this week's assassination of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, was necessary to prevent an imminent attack against Americans in Iraq and around the wider Middle East."
"48 hours after the drone attack that claimed Soleimani's life, that narrative is starting to unravel amid reports that Trump took the unprecedented step of killing a foreign leader based on thin evidence of a threat and with an eye towards domestic politics."
The administration has so far provided little evidence that killing Soleimani has made Americans objectively safer-while the strike has clearly worsened the status quo by raising the likelihood of Iranian reprisals and the prospect for open war.

He ordered some of our diplomats to be assassinated and started a raid on our embassy.
Proof?
It’s in a speech he gave.
He gave a speech about the embassy protest before we assassinated him? Link?
"<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-03/iran-vows-harsh-reponse-after-general-killed-us-airstrike"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-03/iran-vows-harsh-reponse-after-general-killed-us-airstrike</a>"
That doesn't mention him giving a speech about the embassy. Nor any speech.
It literally has the video of him giving the speech in it.
Your proof is Trump giving a speech?
That guy was one of the top terrorists in Iran and he has killed over 600 of our people also he threatened us.
Soleimani was a general in the Iranian military.
"Why wouldn't he threaten us? We toppled the Iranian government, funded and directed Iraq in a war against Iran that killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians. We've killed millions of people in Iraq. But Iran's general, Soleimani, is a terrorist and we're the squeaky clean good guys? That's fucking twisted."
"How many civilians have American generals killed, does that mean that it would be justified to kill them?"
And here's the point where op forgets to provide actual proof
Illegal and dangerous.
This clown had been overseeing attacks on Americans for years. Perfect use of a missile.
Off to Allah with you now
"I don't think anyone from a us perspective is upset or disappointed that they are dead, it's probably more the circumstances, method, and decision making process that lead to it."
What law justified an assassination of a member of a foreign government without a declaration of war?
"Fuck off, warmonger"
"Sheesh, you roaches are really out in force these last few days"
Trump has been overseeing the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians for years.  Soooooo...
"Wait, you mean cleaning up Obama’s messes?"
That’s a pretty pathetic attempt.
Exactly how did Trump start Iraq?
You got rekt.

I read recently that Texan conservsitves shot down distributing the HPV vaccine and now they have more cervical cancer than anywhere else.
"Ignores Iran's use of terrorism, blames the Deep State."
"The argument I use against my pro-military, nationalist family is that if they truly believe Pakistan and others harbour and protect terrorists attacking India, why not let them in?"
"Right now, they plot attacks in another country where we cannot touch them (to an extent) and orchestrate attacks. Were they to be able to freely enter, we could actually use the tech we use to spy on civilians to actually find terrorists, and be able to deal with them/ try them/ arrest them"
"And there are already hella undocumented immigrants anyway. Open borders would boost the economy, too, obviously"
Interesting.
...or they could continue to plot outside the country to avoid detection and then use your open borders to more easily commit such an attack.
"Sure, but (specific to my family, or some nationalists' beliefs) they already commit terrorists attacks, and already get in and out."
​
"I personally don't believe in literal open borders, and my ideal system would likely be more stick on criminals."
"Well considering the animosity between India and Pakistan, I can understand the fears. I would be interested in seeing the reactions by those same politicians if Pakistan claimed India would send terrorists. "
"Anyhow my argument is a little contradictory to yours. My belief is that the state has a duty to protect (Not own) the property of its residents as well as enforce the NAP principle. Therefore if there is a reasonable threat against that, reasonable action can be taken such as border control. Considering a majority of those nations are democratic, the people’s will to not have their property threatened (theoretically) reinforces this point. With this being said however, you can make an easy argument for easing immigration guidelines. "
"While I don’t agree with this argument, one could necessarily argue that the state has no right to segregate people based off of arbitrary labels. If one happens to be born in Pakistan, now he has no right to travel to other countries, is that right? Even then, if terrorist attacks are threatened, India and its residents have the right to protect themselves and catch as well as try those criminals in court. In itself, it’s one giant circle of individual rights correcting the world."
"One libertarian argument is that border control means guns, which are not only trained outwards but also inward. Meaning that citizens inside the border are also policed for who they associate with (employ or transact with), and that's unjust. As the argument goes, it's more unjust to ""imprison"" all your citizens in this way than to keep out a few possible bad apples."
"Though I tend to agree, I wonder if there's a stronger argument?"
"According to Brookings, there are as many as 12,000,000 undocumented people living in America. Having closed borders hasn’t stopped anything. As a matter of fact, it has increased the number of illegals here. "
"Prior to the militarization of the border, migrant workers, mostly males, would cross the southern border for seasonal work and return to their families for the offseason. Now that it’s more difficult to come and go, they stay and try to bring their families here. "
Closed borders has dramatically increased the number of permanent illegal residents in the United States.
Lack of prosecution of employers knowing employing undocumented workers is probably one of the major reasons there are 12 million.

Give up on being afraid of sickness and death.
"I always thought an exemption to patent law for healthcare would make sense.  Say generics could be manufactured immediately, or medical devices could incorporate patentened technologies. The patent holder would be entitled to something like 60-70% of the sale price.  Innovation would still lead to hefty profit, but not to gouging or the stifling of innovation."
The patent holder would be entitled to something like 60-70% of the sale price.
"Most medicine isnt that profitable when generics are allowed, meaning generics would lose money (no way they make enough on most drugs on generics) on anything they make until the patent dies."
The scenario is generics would be allowed immediately and always.  So ultimately no medicine would cost the public more than 3-4 times it's cost of production.
The scenario is generics would be allowed immediately and always.
Yes i got that. Few mediciations are profitable if you only earn 30% of base sales. You probably won't even cover manufacturing let alone profit at that rate. 
Your systems flaw is that you destroyed incentive to make a generic before you even began. All the patent holder does is kill you off then resume course.
"The patent holder would only be paid while the patent was effective.  So ~95% of generic medications would be unaffected.  I cannot see how allowing an avenue for generic competition, where there currently isn't one, would do anything but bring prices down."
My point is your percentage is to high mate.
"Too low a percentage would discourage the creation, testing and patenting of new drugs all together."
"If the question was how to bring down the prices of all drugs, even those that are available genericly and not largely profitable, the only answer is some form of subsidy.  Which in a libertarian sub, would not be a permissible answer IMO"

Did Codefuser tell you to come in here?
So what was the opinion? I'm just here for the drama.
His opinion is that Donald Trump not being a libertarian is relevant to the discussion.
"Obviously his opinion isn't shared, because it didn't get upvoted."
"So like the little pussy bitch he is, <a href=""/u/Elranzer"" rel=""nofollow"">/u/Elranzer</a> stickied it on top and disabled replies because he's too spineless to face criticism.  Hell, this entire post is <em>about him</em> and he's too gutless to even show his face in here."
It's actually hilarious how much of a coward he is.
Mod Reports:
Elranzer: It's targeted harassment at me
"While he hasn't commented, he has reported it. So please stop username pinging him. "
"As mods we don't want to disable username pings because it can be useful to have, but when it is done a lot (I see 3 in the queue) it fills up our inbox. And when it's done to whine and complain versus ask questions (which should honestly go to modmail so we all see them) it gets annoying and problematic."
"It can also be useful on other subs, people username ping me when they have questions about firearms and firearm laws for example."
"Alright, fair enough.  I'll stop doing that."
Haha nice
You’re a petulant child with nothing better to do than insult libertarians and anyone else who doesn’t bend over and grab their ankles for the Cheeto God-Emperor.
"Lol, it's hilarious that you think forcing your opinion to the top of the page by virtue of your position of power and shutting down any discussion which might refute you is ""libertarian."""
That shows exactly how little you understand what libertarianism is.
"I don’t even know what the fuck you’re talking about. I have zero power on this subreddit. You’re welcome to say words buddy, but that doesn’t make them true."
"Lol.  The mods in this sub are a bunch of clowns, but that's news to no one."
Raunchy why are you such a whiny bitch

Nope.
"My rebuttal is that if that was relevant, Elranzer could've put it in the comments section and people would've upvoted it."
"Instead, he used his mod powers to pin it to the top no matter how downvoted it gets and also to disable replies so no one could make fun of him."
"He knows it's not relevant, he just wants his voice to be loudest because he's an authoritarian."

Imagine being so triggered that you felt the need to write a post like this.  What's wrong with you inside?

There are virtually no Republicans that are fiscally conservative.
"Hush, you are breaking the narrative. When Republicans screw up, it is just a misunderstanding. When Democrats screw up, it is malicious and on purpose."
Are you under the impression that Republicans are fiscally conservative?
They are. 
Fiscally <strong>responsible</strong>? NO.
Either
"If they arent responsible, they arent conservative. Passing the buck down the road isnt fiscal conservative."
If Republicans were actually fiscally conservative you could potentially have a point.  They are not.
"Compared to libertarians? No, they aren't. "
"Compared to Democrats? The party consistently calling for MORE government spending? Yes, they certainly are."
Republicans spend more than Democrats.
"<a href=""https://www.mercatus.org/sites/default/files/figure_1._per_capita_federal_spending_1945-2017.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mercatus.org/sites/default/files/figure_1._per_capita_federal_spending_1945-2017.png</a>"
"Per capita spending this upcoming year will be around $13,500, an increase of about $1,500 since Obama left office."
A political party is more than just the President you retard
House
Senate
Governorships
State congresses
etc
"And you should cite a source for your last claim, it's not included in that graph"
"And even then what occurs under a presidency is not necessarily reflective of that President's political inclinations, because Presidents do not have absolute power."
"And you should cite a source for your last claim, it's not included in that graph"
"Current population is 331 million.  Federal spending in 2019 was 4.4 trillion, works out to about $13,300 per capita."
"I actually may have understated the amount for 2020.  Trump's budget request was actually about 4.75 trillion.  That's more like $14,300 per capita."
"Compared to Democrats? The party consistently calling for MORE government spending? Yes, they certainly are."
Bull fucking shit.  Dems actually try to PAY for their spending with taxes.  Republicans spend as much if not more and just add it to the deficit
Get outta here with this idiocy
Republicans typically want less spending than Democrats
"What?  No, they don't.  They want just as much spending as the Dems, and you can tell this is true because they spend just as much as the Dems do when they are in control."
Especially on the military.  Military budget went up every single year under Bush.  It went down every year but one under Obama.  Has gone up every single year under Trump.  Not to mention Bush going from a surplus to a half trillion deficit.  Or Trump going from a half trillion deficit to a 1.2 trillion deficit.
That wall definitely costs less then not a wall.
Just like a Ferrari costs less then a Ford escort.
"OP, apparently, has never heard the term Blue Dog Democrats"
They all got put down except Manchin.
"edit: Republicans may not be fiscally conservative compared to libertarians, but they are far more fiscally conservative than Democrats. "
Can you give an example where this is true?
Meanwhile Democrat have more better fiscal records on the whole. They tend to control states that give more then take federal dollars and manage to have more successful economies. 
"Only Republicans states that I know give more then take is Kansas (when it isnt committing Seppuku under Brownback) and Utah. Nebraska is borderline. As for successful economies, Texas is still Red, for now."
Correlation does not prove causation.
So then OP correlation is not proof?
Better tell that canadianasshole1 to delete.
I never made any claims about correlations between how much a government spends and and who is in charge of that government. 
"Rather, higher spending, specifically social spending, is literally part of the Democratic Party platform. "
"It is causal, you dumb cunt."
"It's easy to be ""fiscally conservative"" when it means racking up huge debts with no plan to pay for it, beyond cosmetic cuts to the services used by the non-rich."
There are virtually no Democrats that are fiscally conservative.
Other than the majority that propose tax increases to go along with spending increases.
That’s not what fiscal conservatism is.
"Libertarianism is the belief that individuals have right to ownership of self &amp; products of labor, and that these rights can be mutually reciprocated and equally enforced. It is not the belief that individuals should be ""socially permissive"" or advocate for ""fiscally conservative"" policies. These are extremely vague phrases. These phrases could refer to opposite ideas depending on the context in which they are brought up. Obviously libertarians are not ""socially permissive"" of theft of products of labor, nor are they in support of ""fiscally conservative"" policies such as raising revenue by theft of products of labor."

"I agree, I care of the biasism of reporting between the parties. I don't really give a shit who stuck what in who."
Absolutely it would. CNN and MSNBC would be jizzing their pants. But they haven’t put out any articles about this.
Remember Bristol Palin?
"Fair question. I’d say all of the leftists in here shilling for him and/or downvoting the post. Hunter Biden has a history of doing shady shit and allegedly engaging in international corruption directly linked to who he is. The media is largely choosing not to report this, and that is dishonest. We all know they would be all over it if it involved one of Trump’s children. Pointing out double standards is important."

"Ehh, I'm going to need pics of said stripper."
Now lets see what his net worth is for child support. Should be interesting.
"Yes, there is certainly an argument for President Trump's strong posturing with Iran by executing Soleimani.

Why did this need a judge? Isn’t that a matter of science?
"Biological father is established by the paternity test. Legal responsibility of the father needs to be established by the judge, using the paternity test while establishing it is accurate and legitimate."
"Hahaha Hunter Biden what a stupid liberal, I know Trump would never do any thing like this./s"
Trump uses a condom when he sex with porn stars.
Dodge child support? Doesn’t seem like Trump has ever done that.
So?
Crack cocaine is a helluva drug
"To those asking why this is important, its helping establish his character. No idea if he was married at the time, or if after finding out he's the dad he tried weaseling out of it. But the liberals all argue these folks are good people who make the occasional mistake. One blackface photo from 1992 isn't enough for someone like me, who doesn't give a rats are about mistakes made in ones youth, to write someone off. However if you establish a timeline of continued fuck ups over the course of years, it strengthens arguments. Such as the need to investigate the Biden's shady dealings with foreign companies. I'm Sure you see where I'm going with this."
"Exactly. I agree that we shouldn’t penalize someone for past mistakes, but a history of shady dealings should absolutely disqualify you from a political position. Things like stealing from charities, not paying vendors, paying hush money to porn stars, multiple bankruptcies, multiple sexual assault accusations, consistently lying, nepotism, etc. etc."
But...but...but...whataboutism.   Seems to be a fairly popular word that you moonbats have been tossing around the last couple of years.   Yet here you are...
"Ultimately it’s hypocritical af to say one person is sleazy for having a kid with a stripper, but it’s okay for another to cheat on his wife with a porn star. Either they are both sleazy or they both aren’t. Which is it?"
So you are saying if the is enough of these behaviors to investigate Biden then there is even more reason to investigate Trump?
Yes.
He sure seems to be a scummy dude across the board
Oh! A future CEO!
Plus has not received one iota of help from Congress
Not only no help but had to battle them on everything
Imagine what he could have accomplished with help from the do nothing Democrats
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Trump is the best thing to ever happen in U.S. politics
Does not owe anybody anything and not afraid to go against the establishment or big business
Plus does not even take a salary
He has debt. He literally owes people millions
Bla bla bla. That’s just liberal propaganda with no substance.
"Which he could pay off easily, but if he's making more in interest than he's paying in interest, that would be a bad move."
Shit happens
Stupid ass should have just paid for the kid when he had the chance.
He can still pay for the kid. He's not broke. We all know how much he made in Ukraine.
Ha!!! Lollllzzzzzz😂

This doesnt prove that Iran shot down a plane. It doesn't disprove it either. Its wierd that there was a break in radio comms with the pilot. One might expect mayday if there was technical failure. An abrupt blast doesnt coincide with engine fire either.
Possibly. The circumstances are such that it's going to be the onus of the investigators to rule out a military accident.
An even-handed and prudent victory for which Trumps administration will get credit.

"Good news 👍! Here in NYC, the mayor has such an anti-law enforcement bias that it's now a criminal offense to call someone an illegal alien or immigrant."
"Good news 👍! Here in NYC, the mayor has such an anti-law enforcement bias that it's now a criminal offense to call someone an illegal alien or immigrant."
Well that's just retarded and I say that as an immigrant. Why the fuck is a criminal offense to call someone an immigrant ?
Seriously???
I want to see the Dems argument against 2nd amendment sanctuary cities. 
I’ll hand them the shovel.
"Remember when California was told it wasn't allowed to NOT give its state funds to illegals because immigration was considered a federal matter?  Boy, times have changed."
When was that??
"As time goes by and Trump and McConnell continue to fill court vacancies with judges who follow the law, rather than make stuff up, this will become more common.  If he can replicate the number of judges he got confirmed in his next 5 years he has in the first 3, that along with teaching spineless Republicans to fight the donkeys and their lapdog media will be Trump’s true legacy!! "
MAGA 2020
It's about time!
HUGE!
This is coming at the worst time possible considering whats going on in Virginia.
"It isn't about sanctuary cities themselves, it's about the illegal immigrants."
"Than I’m fine with that, i overall support the idea of sanctuary cities though as it is states taking back power and I’m all for local government having power rather than the federal government."
why would anyone support sanctuary cities?  so you support the unlimited flood of illegal immigrants into our country?  that's just great.

Trump has played this entire situation masterfully
Not really
Oh yes he has
"The libs want you to think otherwise. However, in reality everyone knows that President Trump is treating this situation like a pro."
Beat it troll! You’re jealous because Obama was a big part of this problem. And Trump is showing girly man how it’s done!!!!
Do you think we’ll ever hear a speech from Trump where he doesn’t mention Obama? What’s with the obsession?
Can somebody post this to the Liberal feed. Or how do we spread the truth? We need to band together and spread the truth!! I just don’t know what to do.
Unfortunately they’ll just take it as being attacked and then hammer you with all their outlandish views on all of this.
"Dang.. you’re right, it’s so unfortunate. It’s a shame the media is brainwashing the ignorant people that buy into their crap. I’ve completely stopped watching NBC, ABC, CNN, Disney etc. I don’t go to the movies anymore. It just disgusts me to the point that I don’t want to live in this country sometimes. I even served this country and I just can barely stomach it anymore. Will I move? No. I still believe it’s the greatest country in the world. And I do have faith. But the media and whomever is running those puppets needs to be held accountable. We need to get rid of these terrorists that are the media. All the puppets on the left. Who’s running this shit? Soros? The clintons.. I just don’t understand how they get away with this. I mean, look at antifa. All those types of organizations(or whatever they are) it has to stop!"
"While I do agree with you, I think it’s more of a problem that people are so sucked into internet and social media platforms that they tend to believe anything that looks “official” and deem that as true. Then they get news networks distorting the truth and making false claims that these people are small minded enough to believe. I mean come on look at the people who follow Bernie sanders and want him to be president. That guy has less business in office than Crooked Hillary haha"
"Posted it on moderatepolitics and was slammed as this is a conservative narrative.  Weird I had a Persian neighbor who spoke just like this who had family still back in Tehran.  He was always fearful for his mother and brother, said his mom got money and niceties by going to organized events, on the opposite side of you don’t you get to go and get educated at a nice holiday inn"
"Well said.
It’ll be fun to watch the Dems and reddit (aka china) try to spin this and call her a Nazi sympathizer"
"B b but, she’s white!! She can’t Iranian!! She was  probably hired by Trump himself to say this!!"

Our politics has literally become so balkanized that one side cannot provide the other with a perceived win.  
Its asinine.
Umm stupidity?!

Good for him. I hope he got 100 million and goes on to do great things. No kid should get used for political fodder. Regardless of who is in charge.
I hope he starts running for office.
He’s at least got college paid for I bet
And looks like CNN learned nothing 
"""We thus have provided a fair and accurate historical record of how this incident unfolded"""
"I hope the others settle so the kid can move on but a court case with washpost and they want to take it on, so hope it is a bloodbath for them"
Damn I bet hes gonna get paid nicely
It won’t be close to the 250 mil they sued for buy even a few mil will set the kid up nicely for life as long as he’s smart with it.
Anything which lessens their budget for completely fabricating events and presenting them as news is a good thing for the entire world.
"Which, given his political leanings, I am willing to guess he will be smart with."
They were seeking 800 million from CNN and other companies?! Really? You and your family are that emotionally butt hurt?! They give wrongfully convicted prison inmates like 100k. Why should this kid get anywhere close to a million. So ass backwards. I guess that’s just the “sue everyone for millions” culture we’re in now.
Prison inmates probably don’t have the best lawyers
And suing the state is not the same as suing CNN.
"Before we make any judgments, see what the kid does with the money once he gets it. Personally, I see nothing wrong with a lawsuit for millions targeting a company that wrongfully targeted a young kid. Now, if the kid spends it irresponsibly and detrimentally, we will have reason to question motives and make just judgments. However, in the off chance that the money is spent wisely, responsibly, and possibly even for philanthropy, we should also make just judgments. It is wise to remember that everyone reap what they sow."
Fair point. Remind me in a year or two so we can see how this money will be spent wisely.
It's none of our business. It's his money now. He was wronged and CNN is making restitution.
"Sitting from on high and making judgements about that makes one look like a jealous, petty  busybody."
Maybe because no one broadcast fake news about inmates on national level. Sending all sort of crazies that could hurt you and your family. Terrorist organizations like Antifa.
"800m was total amount. CNN was something like 275m. That sum was not due to emotional distress but more like prevention mechanism. So CNN would think twice next time they would spread fake news about some kid. Especially since whole video, not version carefully prepared by CNN was available online. They just didn't care, run with the narration they had and destroyed kid life."
And since CNN is billion dollar corporation you need sum like that to make them hurt.
That’s all fine and dandy. My opinion is that this sue everyone for a billion for emotional stress is very beta male democrat type shit but....  that’s just the day and age we live in. Not just this kid but all the commercials/billboards I see on a daily basis saying “have you been in an accident/wronged/fallen down stairs.... call us now and let’s sue!” ...  shits ridiculous and I think does more harm than good.
I'm sure CNN will have learned nothing from defaming random teenagers after this settlement..
What a clown parade CNN has become.

When you've overplayed your hand its typically best to fold or in this case proceed and watch as your political farce falls apart.
We all know Democrats and logic have been like oil and water these past few years.
It's really sad actually. I've got plenty of left leaning friends I consider intelligent and then they tell me they support impeachment and Pelosi.
Me too (lol). I blame a highly effective brainwashing scheme by the Dems and Media.
My thoughts exactly. I will say the more interesting Democrats/ socialist show up in college political classes.
I can’t imagine how frustrating it most be for conservative students who have to deal with that shit.
"It's not too bad, but you can't speak your mind like they can. If you don't think  like they do your opinion has no merit."
"It’s not bad, you just need to slowly build up to it. If you go in hard with your ideas they think your crazy. Problem is you don’t want to piss off the person giving your grade."
[removed]
Democrats tried to dig up dirt on trump using Ukraine during the 2016 election. How weren't they prosecuted?
"The impeachment is a farce, pure and simple.  They couldn't even do a good job at framing Trump, so they just keep trying the same shit over and over and have lost all credibility."

He’s let the russians and turks take control of Syria, alienating kurd allies, let Iran take over Iraq, alienating iraqi allies. And he’s supporting the Saudi's who actually sheltered the 9-11 hijackers. In all his years he’s reduced US influence in the entire region to a rubble. While his natural opponents are having a field day. He couldnt just find the wargraves of US soldiers who fought for the last 20 years and piss on them directly?"

"Supply and demand.  With no buyers, the prices will go down.  It’ll just take time."
"Incorrect, foreign buyers will come in and increase the price even more. This is a net-negative for citizens all around. Thanks democrats."
Just curious why foreign buyers would want New York housing?  It’s not like it’s Manhattan or anything.
It could be a portfolio item much like gold.  I think the elite of places like China have a lot of dollars that they don't want to bring home/pay taxes on.
China can’t buy American property’s like they could years ago. It’s different now with regulations
Yay.
This statement is pretty much correct. China investors love buying overseas property. I have relatives doing this in China.
Because it’s a way for families to get their $$$ out of countries that might not allow it otherwise
"I don't know why, but I can see with my own eyes it is happening at a RAPID pace."
"Having some money stashed away that's unreachable by your home government is worth it, even if you end up losing out in the investment. Such is why Russians, Chinese, Vietnamese and others buy up properties and don't even rent them out, they are an investment of last resort in case things go badly for them and they need to flee."
"Rental properties. Low to middle income housing is actually better for generating income, I especially if your a slum lord."
Diplomats have houses in the suburbs like Westchester County.
Didn’t trump change the tax law to make this virtually untenable?
Nah! The government will just bail them out like they did in 08.
That won’t happen until 2023 at the earliest.
Anyone know which political party these areas subscribe to? I think I see a pattern here
More like because of the tax cuts people can't write off their property taxes anymore.
Good.
"And to be accurate, it doesn't eliminate the deduction. It just caps it."
"Trump increases taxes on the super-rich, and of course,  super-rich NY Democrats hate it."
Well outside of 5(ish) city centers we are republican.
"Not really a shock. This has been going on for decades now. Paying the equivalent of a down payment on a house annually just from school and property taxes alone is going to burn out people. Of course, the local and state government aren't eager to give a helping hand either after they make the areas unaffordable for most people."
Illinois too!
Same with California
Fun fact: most people who leave California move to Texas.
"And they bring their liberalism with them.  They ruin their own state with liberal policies, then they move and demand their new state become liberal."
"Not all of us. My family and I are life long Republicans. When we do move, we’re bringing our (R) votes with us."
"Same here. My old man used to vote split ticket in Ny. When we moved to NC, we both vote straight ticket for Republicans."
Is a political litmus test required to move within your own country? 
"Not everyone that moves from California is moving because they hate it. People move for many reasons. Family, employment, etc. "
They have the right to vote however they see fit in any state and there is nothing wrong with it.
I’m not implying that 100% of people move because they hate it.  But there are liberals who flee liberal policies and then bring those same policies to their new state.
They aren’t “fleeing”. Like I said some just move due to certain circumstances.
"For example, someone might move to a different state because they enjoy the climate and nature of that state more. They don’t have to change their political beliefs just because they cross state lines. "
"Another example. Many people within states after reaching a certain age no longer want to be living in the middle of the city, so they move to rural areas. Must they now change all their political beliefs to that of someone who has lives in rural America their entire life? "
“Fleeing” due to liberal policies is literally a fabrication.
They're fleeing because they can't afford to live there anymore. Don't kid yourself. California has all of the natural beauty and climate that anybody could find anywhere else.
Thank you
"California is indeed beautiful, but some people at a certain point enjoy living in less populated quiet areas more. So they’ll move to states like Colorado, Utah, Idaho, etc. for various reasons."
"People from California also don’t only love to red states. They move to Washington and Oregon as well, which are very blue states."
It’s not just people from California leaving their state.
"No, listen. <em>Only</em> Californians are moving, it's <em>only</em> the liberals, they're <em>only</em> moving to red states and they're taking our jerbs and turning our cow pastures into kale fields!"
"Joking aside, all kinds of people move for all kinds of reasons, obviously. But there is a very real Cali-to-Texas pipeline right now, specifically for younger tech types who are high earners attracted to places like Houston and DFW with lower costs of living and no state income tax. Austin too, but Austin has always been a very blue city, at least by Texas standards."
"I wonder what percentage of young tech types are moving for personal reasons (taxes, costs, etc) and what percentage are moving just because that's where they were able to land a job. A friend of mine went through a bootcamp and landed a job in Austin in August, but as far as I know he wasn't specifically seeking a job there -- it's just where he was able to get hired after sending out his million resumes and applications."
"You are wrong about individuals leaving due to liberal policies. You still do have a point that it isnt every case of even the majority of cases. People have been leaving Cali because of the outragously large homeless population, they have been moving because of the filth, and they have been moving because of the taxes. Again, while this isnt the most common reason people move, people are still moving because of it. So no, not a ""fabrication""."
I don’t know why people chime in with that when you make a point about something.  I said people flee high tax situations.  Nothing about that implies that I’m saying 100% of people who move are doing it for those reasons.  I’m talking about only those people who are leaving for tax reasons.  It’s like when Trump said there are criminals crossing the border.  That doesn’t imply that 100% of all people crossing the border are rapists.
And the people living in said state have a right to be upset if their state changes due to an influx of people with different lifestyles and values.
"Sure, I have no problem with that. Let them be upset lol."
"I live in Houston, TX.  I see California and New York license plates every day.  Makes me soooooooooo nervous."
I see California and New York license plates every day
That's hilarious because I live in California and constantly see Texas license plates.  I've asked around and no one seems to know why.  I can't even really google to get an answer.  
But I see them EVERYWHERE and I live in the SF Bay Area.
Wow! That is interesting!!! I’m stumped!
NC as well. A lot of people from Texas are here as well.
"I mod the <a href=""/r/ocoee"" rel=""nofollow"">r/ocoee</a> sub, a town in OC Florida. Our looney liberal representative Val Demings voted for the impeachment. We have liberals moving in droves down here. Carpetbaggers that establish residence for a couple of years and then are so bored with their retirement, they decide to run for some political office."
The behavior is so predictable that you truly begin to notice the robotic lemming-like psych profiles of out-of-state liberals that have fled their failed utopian sh*t holes.
You're going to get it too.

"Well, I'm HOPING there's just enough gun-toting rednecks and fossil fuel fracking freaks around here to keep Texas red.  I know I'm planning to do all I can to make that happen and hope there are many others like me.  God help us all."
This is a direct result of the tax reform passed by Republicans in 2017.  It eliminated the high Federal deductions for state and local taxes that allowed NY to get away with charging more than other regions. 
"Prior to the Republican tax reform, essentially the rest of the country was subsidizing the taxes in New York by unwilling proxy."
"This NY Times article from 2017 includes a graphic showing how high NY taxes will affect them even more after reform. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/business/economy/tax-bill-new-york.html"">NY Times</a>"
"All of these Democrat controlled cities are seriously disgusting. Theft through taxation... So good at stealing money, they've been stealing from us all even without living there."
All this did was uncover the ridiculous high taxation policies democrats have cheated their way into for decades. All the 2017 policy did was shine a flashlight on it.  Now residents don’t have a way to circumvent shitty democratic policy and have to take their onerous taxation on the chin.
"Republicans forced the issue. Because we have visitors who might not see the nuance, I want people to be careful here because they might see your point and maybe think that Republicans are to blame. Democrats put all the ingredients of this shit soup into the pot and then turned the heat on very low so no one would know how bad it actually will be. It would end with everyone knowing how bad it is with or without the Republicans, we just walked by and turned up the fire so now people are really smelling how gross the soup is, hopefully ensuring that everyone sees the chef really sucks at his job before they ruin the country."
"Went to Cali for a wedding, the brides parents house was where the reception was and nobody lived on the entire street, excluding themselves of course."
Unfortunately these Blue State refugees  take their brand of politics to Red States.
And every single one of them is coming to North Carolina
And they are moving to red states where they are importing their stupid leftist views and votes.
It's the <em>Great Locust Migration</em> of the 21st century.
"The weirdest riddle I cant seem to get is why Democrats leave New York and California for Texas and Colorado only to vote the exact same way, producing the exact same taxes where they move."
"They don't put 2 and 2 together. They dont realize the policies and laws put in place by the people they elect, is what is either killing jobs or driving up costs. They see a job paying the same, or better, with a lower cost of living and they move. They never think that theres a reason theyre moving to a red state."
We are fleeing because it is a disgusting welfare liberal utopia of illegal immigrants and high taxes and cost of living. I cant wait to gtfoh!
Where are you headed to?
"Uhh, not sure yet man. But out of here for sure. Cant afford to buy a house. Sick of renting and living check to check with barely any savings. Why, do you have any ideas?"
"Midwest. South is struggling, too. West is expensive."
"Yea man I’m sure it’s expensive in the west but  between the electric bill and car insurance is enough to pay some peoples mortgages. Peoples dont understand the cost of living on top of everything else in NYC. There are speeding cameras, red light cameras, bus lane cameras, and 60k cops looking to give you tickets. Tolls to go over bridges and through tunnels are astronomical. MTA is the most corrupt organization in this country but there is never a story written about it. Bus, express bus, trains. Dude you cant live let alone have any financial room to breathe."
Wow. Sounds like ass. Y’all should riot. Sounds like nazi germany.
New York has always been high living cost.
Terrible state of affairs
I wonder who is buying all that property... hMmMm
The result is also democrats spreading into traditional republican territories as they’ve destroyed their home. 
"Wonder if they realize what ruined New York in the first place, and will stop it from happening again..."
Im. In NYS and am. Currently looking for a home in the south.
"Mississippi would be happy to have you.  Low cost of living, peace and quiet, low population density, great music, and the best damned food you've ever put in your mouth."
That is a possibility. I am tired of snow. What the south and mid west call snow makes me laugh. Ill be looking into that state tonight. Ty!

"This, like Ukraine, is turning into a massive headache for Democrats. They had hoped to portray the Iraqi embassy attack as Trump's ""Benghazi."" 48 hours later, Trump rendered that impossible. Dems were forced to do a 180."
"Now, we all get to see exactly how Trump would handle a ""Benghazi""... immediately send reinforcements, then retaliate with force."
There is only so much dissonance the public can accept. Iran is the good guy? Why was Soleimani in Baghdad? Why was he in Baghdad days after the US embassy in Baghdad was attacked by Iran-backed militants? Is that supposed to be some sort of coincidence?
I don't think so.
"Same with Ukraine. Why <em>are</em> so many elite Democrats on Ukrainian corporate boards? Why did <em>Biden</em> threaten to withhold military aid to Ukraine? Why was that OK, when the same wouldn't be OK for Trump?"
If you did a little research you’d be surprised to learn why he was actually in Baghdad
Lol. Enlighten us why the Top Iranian Terrorist commander was in Baghdad with his #2 meeting with the top Terrorist militia leader in Iraq despite UN travel sanctions immediately after a massive Embassy attack where the forces that breached the Embassy planted Iranian flags and wrote Sulumaini's names on the wall.
“Iraqi prime minister says Qassem Soleimani was in Iraq to 'discuss de-escalating tensions between Iran and Saudis' when he was killed - and claims Trump had asked for help mediating talks after embassy attack”
"Let's assume that there was indeed an imminent terrorist attack which Trump thwarted by killing Soleimani....and yet the Dems go nuts condemning DJT.  But what if Trump had <em>not</em> taken that action and the attack was bad.... resulting in loss of life.  The Dems would have gone nuts condemning DJT.  It's <em>all</em> they ever seem to do is go nuts!  It's my fervent hope, nay belief, that the average American Joe is smart enough to see through the incredible amount of BS that the Dems are dishing these days."
"Fuck the democrats. Anything Trump does, they attack. This piece of shit is a literal terrorist and murderer of hundreds of Americans. We ALL know, that if Barry Hussein Obama had launched a hellfire into this fuckwad while he was President, they’d have given him a second Nobel Peace Prize."
"Idk if that's true, a lot of dems criticized Obama's war mongering bullshit too. In fact thats often their biggest criticism of Obama. Pandering to Republicans with war is a huge no-no"
"They were happy with him killing Bin Laden. If the people that praised Obama for killing Bin Laden were logically consistent, they would have to praise the killing of Soleimani too."
"But now hundreds of thousands are at stake, I don’t condone the generals actions but some stones are left unturned. Just my opinion."
"The article raises a good point: we refuse to let ourselves fight at more than a quarter of our full ability. If we did, South Korea would be an island, and Iran would become a new inland sea. And we don't need nukes to make that happen."
"Walk softly and carry a big stick. Showing restraint is almost certainly the best strategy in every case. If we ever end up in a situation where that’s not an option, god help us all."
"Buddy of mine lived in a farm; when he wasn't doing farm chires, he was in the dojo with me. But he never fought in school. He thought he was showing restraint; the other kids saw it as weakness, to the point that even the smallest and weakest were willing to bully him. One day, in 4th grade, the smallest kid in class got him with a baseball bat. He was half conscious and instinctively threw a punch, breaking the kids jaw. That's when the idiots figured out his restraint was to prevent <em>him</em> from hurting <em>them</em>."
Restraint is nice. But a thorough beat-down on one deserving asshat today can prevent you from having to hand them out like Oprah later.
I don’t disagree with anything you’ve said. In particular I agree completely with your second paragraph. 
Where we differ is in the calculus of the response. 
"Breaking the bullies jaw - that’s appropriate. He get’s the point and his pals do too. But what if your response is to suddenly cut off his arm? What happens next? Your friends think you overacted and have a difficult time justifying your actions. The bullies friends, family and loved ones now want to kill you. "
Strategy. Breaking the jaw works. Cutting the arm off makes the problem worse.
I guess we're all gonna find out real soon.
"when people start using red tape procedure and sticking up for terrorists, that should make any American raise their head and question their loyalty to this country."
There are those in the US media and government that legitiately idolize and support terrorism in the same way there were Americans who supported Hitler and the Nazis in the 30's/40's. Ignore them. They are losers and will be nothing more than laughable footnotes in future history books.

BBC
Frankfurter Allgemeine (german)

BBC and Washington Post?! Fucking absolutely liberal shit rags. Is this a joke?

Obama laid a trap for Trump when he listed Iran as top state sponsor of terror
[removed]
First- The point is showing you that ‘legitimate’ news sources are laughably bias. Especially NYT (which has fallen so far) and CNN.
Second- His ‘escalation’ IS fighting terror. Iran clearly was involved in a Benghazi-like assault on an American embassy. The general was with the terrorist leader at the time they were both killed and the general has planned attacks that have taken American lives.
"This was not escalation of any kind. This was a measured response to a gross act of aggression (after several have already been perpetrated in the last several months.) The US also had intel of future attacks he was planning. Yes, liberals are OPENLY supporting Iran. Take a look at the world politics thread."
"Serious question given all that, what does Iran need to do to command a response, blow up
Times Square? Take your bullshit back to r-politics where they’re proudly waving the Iranian flag."
"I’m ashamed of my country 
Those lazy ass crooked democrats have the nerve to condemn a man who shot a mass shooter in church and saved no telling how many lives and then take up for Iran all in the same week."

I am proud to be an American and Trump 2020"

You must be forgetting that the fed gov is just a bunch of children playing red team vs blue team. I appreciate your rational talk tho. Refreshing
That's my point. Why must we play along?
"I don’t understand why Democrats want relations with Iran. I get there is legit revisionism with how the 70s happened but that was 50 years ago. Iran is a regressive third world country that doesn’t like us. Our policy should be sanctioning them and keeping them isolated until they are ready to change, like a Cuba."
If Trump has done something in support of Iran they would all be asking for this. The Democrats are simply opposing anything Trump does. Bunch of losers.
Pretty hilarious that they actually expect Trump to consult and inform them when all they’ve done is work to delegitimize his presidency.
"""Neither were the Iranians, and for the same reason."" Another brilliant line from Dsousa."
I have a nephew serving in Iraq. 1.5 clicks away from missile attacks.  Not one freaking patriot missile. Why the hell would we start an action unprepared for the repercussion

"What's your move if you're Trump? For me, I don't think he has the political capitol to make a push for war and he has isolationist leanings, so war will be off the table (unless the facts change, like further escalation from Iran ). But you can't allow this sort of an attack from a country like Iran. There is a natural order in the world that needs to be kept in place. I think the solution will be to sanction them to the highest degree possible. The country already has civil unrest, escalate it."
"I suspect Iran's ""response"" can be spun and both sides will be able to walk away."
"Seems as though Iran intentionally targeted a base (or area of a base) to ensure no American casualties.  They can say they ""retaliated"" and Trump can say they didn't have the cojones to actually do anything real other than waste missiles."
Bigger question is how Iraq reacts if they suffered casualties.
"Check out the Iranian foreign Minister's response. He spins what happened tonight as ""proportionate"" but is asking to avoid war. Trump has an out."
"Iran is weak AF, this wont be a war"
"I'm against what got us to this point, but striking 52 military targets is what'd be my call if possible."
"A proportionate response would be to launch just as many missiles at Iranian military targets, only make sure ours don't miss.  Match them shot for shot and demonstrate the superiority of our intelligence and guidance systems.  Hit a few missile launch sites.  Hit a couple of airfields.  Hit a few weapons caches on bases.  Go ahead and hit one of the oil fields.  They launched dozens of missiles at military targets.  Do the same.  Just make sure every single one of them hit something of value.  Then hit them with even more sanctions.  Crush them economically.  "
"The next step?  Take the phone off the hook.  Kick every Iranian official from any facility we control and bar them from re-entry.  Refuse to take their calls.  If they get someone else to contact us on their behalf, hang up on that country and don't answer their calls for the rest of the week.  Cut them off completely and give them nothing but silence.  Make sure the media is well-aware that any further aggression from the Iranians will be met with a wildly disproportionate response.  Then shut up about it.  Let everybody sweat.  Only re-open a line of communication once the Iranians publicly and humbly offer their apologies for the strikes on our base and offer to come to the negotiating table wit their hats in their hands.  "
"This isn't the time to talk to the Iranians.  That's what they want, for us to be offering talks while they shoot missiles.  And that's the last thing we should give them.  This has to stop.  They have to stop.  And if that mans we have to slaughter Iranian military personnel by the bushel, so be it."

Why it is going to happen: we're literally attacking each other
Right.... lol
This post sure aged well....  literally a few hours later and you guessed it.... War
Because Iran would be dust
They most definitely would be.
Probably. Or maybe China and Russia would intervene. Who knows? I don’t want to find out.
And Iran knows it.
is that why they just attacked us?
"Attack America, get trillions spent rebuilding your country; if you don't care about your citizens, it's not a bad deal."
The mental gymnastics you just did is astounding
"Since WWII, every country we fight, we rebuild afterwards; the whole world knows it. Look how many trillions we've spent so far in the middle east. If you're a jackwagon dictatorship who doesn't care about its people (and Iran certainly qualifies for that category) then picking a fight with the U.S. is a good way to get big bucks."
We would ruin their economy and the normies in Iran would overthrow the Mullahs.
I agree but they sadly put a 80 million dollar bounty for the Presidents head.
They did not. One random guy in Iran with no power said that.
His daughter promised that.
Nope. It was an unidentified eulogist at his funeral that said “if everyone in the country sets aside one dollar we could offer an 80 million dollar bounty on trumps head.” You should really read more than just headlines.
"Oh, my bad I guess, sorry about that."

The ones that dont support black genocide are. Ever hear of Democrat Margaret Sanger and The Negro Project? Google it.

"I'll believe it when I see it.  The Left hooked blacks on welfare and are seeking to do the same with Hispanics.  However, getting disparate groups to serve the same role means they compete.  The Left's plan was to unite them in hatred of white people.  The media can only conjure up so many tales about racist rednecks and suburban gun owners.  That's not as near as the threat posed by Hispanics.  All the Left promises is continued importation of voters and expansion of their franchise.  Rather than meaning a bigger pie, it means sharing the slice that blacks used to have.  So there is a chance, but I'm not holding my breath.  People generally vote straight ticket out of habit.  Thus this reality might show up in voting as a 70-30 split rather than a 90-10 split rather than a flip."

"I've been against this impeachment from the very beginning of this whole thing.

She and the house have done their part of the process of impeachment, which was unfair and bogus from the very start. Now, they need to let the Senate do their job. How does she think it's fair to try to manipulate the Senate into doing the trial her way when she's already done her part in the whole thing?"
"Why won't she just let the Senate do their part of the process, I honestly think she thinks she can leverage the trial in her favor, she's mistaken. If this impeachment process was so righteous and so genuinely for the safety of the United States, then why hasn't she given the articles to the senate? "
This whole this is a making the Democrats look bad for the 2020 election
Out of office would be nice too!
I like the idea of motioning to dismiss if they don't send the articles over. Is that possible?

I am not surprised the Saudis are happy he's dead.
I am iraqi and most people in my country was celebrating on the day he was killed except some few dumb iran supporters
Seems only the left in the US are mourning his passing.
From what I hear (most people I talk to are more left/European) people arent mourning him. They are nust scared that this will escalate things
"No, the leftist establishment media will try to escalate things, notice how they aren't mentioning how this terrorist was planning on attacking an embassy or how he's killed before?"
I was just stating that in my experience that is how people.on the left feel. I didnt mention the media or establishment
"It's been explained on reddit, yet not on some of the new sources I watch. That being said, you play a game of chicken long enough and someone eventually gets burned."
Or how Iran is Russia’s ally in the region...
Saudi royal family owned newspaper it's obviously a fair and legit newspaper
Killing Soleimani was an antifa operation.
Based on.....?

Because if Donald Trump cured cancer Liberals and the media would complain about him putting Oncologists out of business.
"Because the mainstream media is so opposed to President Trump, it would support Satan if it meant opposing the President."
"When they have such hatred for Trump, normal cognitive ability to distinguish between lunacy and reality goes right out the window.  And it’s important to put and keep these psychotic deranged human trash out of power, forever."
This is what I’ve been saying all day. People who hate Trump will say and do anything that furthers their hate or supports it.

"Not liberals but the extreme Leftist and the Democrats, its not Facist, this is battle of good and evil, whats morally sound and what isn't, The democrats will weaken this country and the Islamic people will take over and the one world religion and government be established just as shown in Revelations."
"Because they hope to hurt Trump. Right or wrong is out the window. Logic, cause and effect - who cares. They hate Trump and that is what matters. "
"Unfortunately, shouting the same lies over and over is quite effective."
Because Trump is anti Iran and the media is anti Trump so they’re pro Iran.

"“If you’re for it, I’m against it.”  This is how they operate and it’s how the average unengaged and uninformed voter with an echo chamber social media page operates.  I don’t think it’s just with Trump, but this will be how opinions are made going forward."

What Donald Trump did was important for the people of America! That SOB Iranian Military General was killing our people! Why people would be pissed at his move is beyond me.

"It’s like one post said, if Donald Trump was to kill the devil himself, people would say, “Satan wasn’t that bad!”"
Just as they literally made deals with Sadam Hussein to provide less than rigorous coverage in exchange for “access” during the early days of the Iraq war. They’re more concerned with narrative and bolstering their team (the Left) than they are with research or facts.
What a weird revision of history. Most criticism of the media leading up to and during the early days of the Iraq War is that they blindly bought into unproven (and since disproven) rationales for the war. 
The American media was not on Saddam's side. I don't know how anyone could think that. Any proof of these 'literal deals'?
"Despite your confrontational tone insinuating I’m a liar, here are some links. As you can see in re-reading my comment, I did not say they were “on Saddam’s side”, just as I would not say they’re all in for Iran. But there was plenty of criticism at the time of CNN specifically being willing to soften certain things in order to maintain “access”.  "
"<a href=""https://honestreporting.com/cnns-iraqi-cover-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> talks about and links to an op ed of CNN admitting to not reporting certain things in order to maintain access.

So that article is almost 2 years old. I think he’s not going to.
This is the only relevant comment here.
Interesting. It doesn’t say bribes though. Could be referring to those who received campaign funding.
Dont we call this quid pro quo now? And isn't it impeachable?
Better to not make quick judgements without more knowledge and evidence. A nation your quasi at war with isn’t exactly trustworthy. Plus most of the diplomatic staff who took bribes were likely appointed 5-10 years ago at a minimum so if your referring to impeaching Trump then no it’s likely Obama era staffers.
"I can definitely see your point, but once an allegation has been made couldn't you just follow the money from there and should prove whether or not the allegation had any merit?"
Definitely. But first let’s see what Iran has.
"Right, let’s get those Obama frauds."
"Yes, Obama/Biden admin was chock full of it. Hillary’s pay to play schemes, etc.."
"Sure it was signed in 2013 under obama, and his administration. Lets go after them."
"Those Iranian idiots, that’s no threat!  That sounds great actually."
Did any of you actually even check the article? It's from 2018... jfc...
Trump bombs Iranian Terrorist.
"Iran ""We will retaliate!"""
"America ""Yeah?  With what?"""
"Iran ""We'll expose corrupt Democrats!"""
"America ""... alright, we're waiting."""
"Wouldn't you want them to expose corrupt Republicans too? I sincerely hope the Iranians expose any politicians who took or gave bribes to them, from any nation including the US. The way your comment reads, is that you hope they expose corrupt Democrats, while ignoring any potential corruption within the Republican party. That's probably not what you meant, which is why I'm replying."
"This. I don’t care what way you lean, if you’re corrupt you’re corrupt. Expose them all. drain the swamp. RINO’s included."
Would be kinda difficult seeing as the Iran Nuclear Deal was the baby of Ben Rhodes and performed in the Obama Administration under the table without Congressional knowledge or approval.
"Sure, for that particular deal maybe. But there might be or have been some other side-deals going on in other contexts with Iran. Drain the whole swamp, as the other commenter said"
"If the Iranians uncovered corruption on any politicians I'd be more than happy to see the evidence, Republicans or Democrats.  The issue is with what they're claiming to be willing to uncover was not a Republican issue, it was 100% Democrat, and 100% the Obama Administration, hence the verbiage of my comments."
"Yes, I understand that. The Iran Nuclear deal was definitely a Democrat deal"
"DO IT. Do it now, fucker. I don’t see that as a threat. I hope he exposes them."
You do realize that deal occurred under  The Obama administration so nobody under trump administration would be exposed to
What are you on about? No part of his comment said otherwise.
That’s the point!
"Guys, this is from 2018..."
"2018 called, it said that Iran isn’t gonna do shit."
LOL.  A whos who of the Obama Administration.
Well. We’re waiting.
DO IT
Well...we're waiting
Go big
"Do it, please."
Do it! Expose those corrupt dems!
This would only help Trump....
Please tell us.
"Oh please, Iran, don't expose the corruption. You can't do that..."
"If they are smart, they could literally be doing to because they are afraid and it will help them get us to stop attacking."
Ok
"Well despite the fact that the article is old, maybe these current events will bring it back to his memory and he'll follow through with his great idea."
Do it!
Bingo!
Do it - palpatine voice
Expose it now.
"If he only names Obama, I'll be happy."
"""No one is above the law!  Except for Biden, it is illegal to investigate him.""  -The lunatic left-"
Excellent.......It is hardly a threat though
Please let this happen.
Doooooo ittttttt
As diplomats scramble for more payoff money....
Please don’t throw me in that briar patch!
I would welcome this
I miss Obama

There is no possibility of a war with Iran brother. They may be dumb enough to try a few hit and run terroristic type attacks but the fuck is iran going to do? They kill their own protesters. Do you really think the rank and file are going to fight for a regime they hate?
Do you really think the rank and file are going to fight for a regime they hate? 
Facts.
It's just a matter of time before their own people reset their nation to the pre-wacko mullah era of Iran.
This is an old report. But I think every republican welcomes this. I hate to say it but that's a core difference between dems and repubs. Repubs want all truths revealed. Dems only if it backs their story. I want to see who took bribes dem or Republican. Were all just pretty confident it's mostly or all dems lol

"Honestly, I’m just baffled that our elected officials think it’s okay to undermine our Government by apologizing to Iran of all nations for killing a general who is responsible for destabilizing the Middle East whenever he got the chance. I don’t support every action that our Government takes because blind loyalty is hardly healthy for the political process, but when you have people like Elizabeth Warren apologizing on twitter while running for the most powerful office in the world, it’s down right treasonous. We didn’t apologize to the Arab-American community when we killed Bin Laden, what makes Iran different?"

"Isn’t that what happens anytime there is national conflict? Patriotism goes up, meaning support for the president goes up."
"To some degree, yes. But this is a bit different. There was an attempted attack on our embassy, Trump thwarted it so that may add to his approval rating, but he also killed an enemy combatant who happens to also be Iranian military. If it weren't for the connection to the Iranian military, this should also add to his approval rating. The thing is, the hard left is dead set on calling this an act of war, an ""escalation"", a rise in tensions... etc. They are so militant about it that the rhetoric I hear is dangerous. The media is playing into this fear as well. Being the media is still very powerful, you would think that this fear might hurt the president's approval rating."
"In other words, this is more complicated. It's more of an ""incident"" in the public's view than a ""conflict"". At least, this is why I think it's a bit surprising."
"I agree completely. This is not going to end in war. I’m almost positive of it. And even if so, Iran would be very unwise to attempt an attack, but what do I know?"
Not all of the far left hates him for it Butegeg( or something) and Biden love that he did this

Most of reddit couldn’t even point out Iran on a map and yet they are worried about going to war with them because orange man bad.
"That's true for most Americans anyway. They view this as 'an incident' as someone above pointed out correctly more than 'a conflict' bec the average Joe (pun unintended) really has no grasp on geopolitics except what he hears and watches on TV both, news and entertainment."
"I don’t know about Mayor Pete’s position, but Biden did not say he loves this. He said he agrees that a terrible, terrible man was killed and nobody is upset about that, but then went onto say that this wasn’t the right course of action."

Are you intentionally downplaying this or do you really not know about this guy’s history?
They kill a contractor? This guy has killed hundreds of Americans and other people over the years.
"Yeah, just a contractor."
I really think there is something really wrong with the fact that all of the liberals in America are protesting the assassination of general Qassim while a lot of Iranians are thrilled to not live under the regime any longer
"This whole event has really shown me that people don’t really care about politics.  All they care about is cheering for their team.  “If you’re for it, I’m against it” is a real thing and it drives everything in politics now."
On both sides I think
[removed]
"See on the other hand, I believe the contrary. An act of terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation against civilians.” The air strike was neither unlawful nor against a civilian.  I believe the general was the only person killed in the air strike, and being a high ranking official in the Iranian military, is not a civilian. It wasn’t an act of terrorism, but retaliation for murdering hundreds of American troops, and was caught in the act of planning another attack not against out military, but against civilians and non-military personnel. That sounds not only like a reasonable thing to carry out, but also necessary to protect the citizens, safety, and life of America. Doesn’t it to you?"
What is it called when you invite someone to negotiate with you then you kill them?
[removed]
The fact that the Iraqi’s have voted to have us expelled from the country tells me they are thrilled with the US right now too... I try to stay as open minded on politics as possible but Trump got this one wrong. The guy needed to go but inviting him to talk peace with Iraqi PM to negotiate and then killing him once he arrived is disgraceful
"Some Iranians are celebrating his death and thanking Trump for it, but the media doesn't cover it for some reason."
"Instead, they wish Uncle Qassim was telling their kids a bedtime story. Effing whack jobs. Even if Trump freed millions of Iranians from religious slavery tomorrow, the liberals would still cry and protest."
Imagine being upset because a terrorist was killed and an attack on American diplomats was foiled.
"""B-But Iran!"" No one can be blamed for their choice to support a criminal."
"I think the issue from those upset isn’t so much that he was killed/attack foiled, rather that <em>because</em> of it, we <em>may</em> be headed down a path where <em>more</em> lives will be put at risk from escalated armed conflict"
"Blame Soleimani. His actions are what started it all, not the defense against them."
"And you know what? If Iranians had an ounce of decency, they would not be outraged by the death of a criminal. "
It's hard to appease this kind of people without violating your own morals.
[removed]
"It's funny how the Left is telling the tale like ""Oh, Soleimani was just minding his business and the madman Trump suddenly bombed him 'cause he was in that kinda mood""."
"Yes, it is about terrorism. He'd been involved in it long before and Trump acted based on the Defense Department's info about preparations being made for an attack."
And I doubt that the American diplomats whose lives were saved are overly concerned about formalities being neglected.
"The thing is, nobody is disputing those atrocities committed by this man. He was evil and deserved nothing less than to swing from the gallows."
The issue is that the usa INVITED this person to the negotiation table to discuss things. Then the USA killed the invited person knowing full well who he was and why he was there.
[removed]
Of course. Formalities are more important than the lives of American diplomats.
[removed]
"Yes, because the attack was thwarted thanks to a combination of the Intelligent Department's intel and the president's quick action."
We should be celebrating that has been prevented.
The outcry isn’t at the act of assassinating him. It’s more aimed at the fact that we invited him to talk peace using the Iraqi PM as a mediator and then killing him when he arrived in Iraq without Iraqi approval. And also that the proper channels were not notified of the event happening.
Most people would agree that he was a terrible person whose actions cannot be justified and deserved retribution.
"People see a protest now and they are like, ""Me too"" please.  The protesters that we see on TV over there are Iranian totalitarian brainwash victims. Reminds me of WW2 Germany and the people fervishly heiling when most of them were obviously scared for their lives."
I am a liberal and I think this was a good move by trump. The threat of force was also a good idea besides the cultural area attacks. It was actually one of the few days where I think he had a good day.
Promises made promises kept. He’s actually doing damage to our enemies
[removed]
"Well this last act wasn’t an act of war, it was killing a terrorist. Yes it’s possible that Iran could retaliate and start a war, but it’s a larger possibility that Iran knows they don’t have the resources to win a war against us. Trump isn’t anti war, he’s america first. He does what he believes benefits america the most"
I've approved of him since day 1.
How does that dick taste?
"Why don't you tell me? I'm heterosexual, I leave the dick tasting to people like you."
"I don't get it, the comm... Politics sub tells me they keep sliding"
[removed]
"So you mean trump is doing exactly what Clinton did during his impeachment, only he’s killing the leader of the al-quds force, an organization with ties to every major Shia terrorist organization rather than a bunch of random Iraqis military personnel."
"What’s great about this is buttegeg (or however you spell it) and Biden are both commending him. While Pelosi is mad because he didn’t tell her, which if he did Soleimani would’ve gone into hiding and we wouldn’t have got him"
"Trump doing what he accused Obama of possibly wanting to do, starting a war with Iran to save his election"
We have to do whatever it takes to win. The DNC has been playing dirty for decades.
[removed]
"Could you give a list of examples for voter suppression, which you claim republicans have been using for decades?"
Not surprised at all. Handling the impeachment and his job well
I mean. That was the whole point.
That's why he did it.

Google it
The left tried making the us embassy attack in Baghdad the new Benghazi but trump responded by killing the guy organizing it instead of blaming it on a YouTuber
Thought you cant trust polls...
"Are you trying to mock us with this? You trusted polls, too. That's why it hurt so bad when Hillary lost."
"You can't trust polls, but you can trust trolls to think they are clever."
"You can't because they are so biased against him. Rasmussen, which is generally more fair, has him at 50% approval as of yesterday, higher than BO at same time."
"The reason for that is not everyone will vote on it. Do this one, that could only mean his approval rate is higher"

Gotta love Lindsey Graham
This new Lindsay Graham is great. The old one....I didn't care for him much.
"I think Lindsay Graham realized what a lot of us have over the last couple years. Namely, the left are no longer our allies, they don’t want the same things we do, and what they want will destroy America. Once you realize that, you don’t have to worry as much about being nice and  bringing people together, just worry about winning elections and pushing good policy."
Lindsey Graham seems to have improved since his buddy John McCain passed away.
"The guys over at the leftist subs already have ""anti-propaganda"" propaganda going. It's a nice seat to have, ignoring the lives saved while talking about how bad attacking terrorists is."
The left cant distinguish the difference between nazis and religious fundamentalism. The toleration and preference for one while saying fuck the other has me astonished.
They never really cease to astonish me.  When Omar asked what legal authority Trump had to do this I was again amazed.
"I thought bringing a 9 year old ""transgender American"" on television was definitely top five insane leftist moments."
So when can I stop putting up the wanted posters for Jessie Smollets aggressors... They are out there somewhere.

That'd be a sight to see and with the stuff they've been doing i wouldn't put it past them
"Probably, since Trump didnt negotiate with terrorists for a traitor in return like Obama did."
Now the Dems want to protect Iran?  WTF is wrong you people?
They can’t do shit!!
They will impeach him for obstructing the Russian investigation they paid for.
"Why, because he told a guy to fire the guy. That's obstructing a crime you know you didnt commit. "
The mental gymnastics the left perform deserves a damn tip jar at times.
"But remember, he only want him ""replaced"", wasn't canceling or stopping anything. Huge difference."
It impeded his presidency and everyone knew it was nonsense. Democrats have done nothing but sabotage national security with that investigation and now this BS impeachment.
We got work to do!
Totally agree.
Metal music is for brainless dickless daddy fuckers
"So, your a huge fan of Metal, eh?"
You're
You are. Why the animosity?
Idk about Political Democrat leaders but regular democrats support trump in killing soleimani.
Democrats will do anything to defy Trump. They will side with murderers if it means they get the spotlight for half a second.
Trump ordered a kill of this terrorist and that’s that. Any dem whining is just pandering to their muslim masters.
"First Russia 🇷🇺 (1st failure), then Ukraine 🇺🇦 (2nd failure) and now Iran 🇮🇷 (future failure). They'll try everything to get him out"
"I just don't understand why an innocent man wouldn't show proof of his innocence, and instead refuse to show it?"
Dims are trying to pull off a double impeachment.  ?They are trying to remove Trump and Pence at the same time.
Is that even possible or legal to do that?
They will try anything.  They have completely destroyed their lead in the presidential polls.  Not even the liberal polling institutes can bend the number that much.
​
They are in dire straits right now.
"I mean, impeachment isn’t really a legal process unfortunately. But hypothetically if they did, Nancy is officially our new president. "
Fucked up and this country would never be able to handle something like that. But it’s technically possible haha
We would be at war in seconds after that happened.
I could see this potentially happening IF and ONLY IF what is being reported on today with regards to why Soleimani was in Iraq is true (that POTUS asked Iraq to act as a diplomatic middleman between US/Iran) AND that it comes out that the US knew that Soleimani was in Iraq as Iran’s representative for those deescalation talks. 
"Because then there’s a reasonable (maybe right, maybe not) argument to be made that the killing was an act of perfidy in war, or a war crime. "
"Although the US has passed legislation so that Americans cannot be tried in international court for things of this nature, the Democrats may view such a charge being levied domestically as a way to, in their view, salvage the nation’s moral standing in the world."
"If what the Iraq PM said was true, then yes probably, it is a warcrime."
“I received a phone call from @realDonaldTrump when the embassy protests ended thanking the government efforts and asked Iraq to play the mediator's role between US and Iran” Iraqi PM said.  
"“But at the same time American helicopters and drones were flying without the approval of Iraq, and we refused the request of bringing more soldiers to US embassy and bases” iraqi PM said.  "
"“I was supposed to meet Soleimani at the morning the day he was killed, he came to deliver me a message from Iran responding to the message we delivered from Saudi to Iran” Iraqi PM said."
Obviously not. Let’s try to focus on real things.

"Welcome to where we 2nd Amendment supporters have been for over 3 or 4 decades. About 25 years ago, Wayne LaPierre,  then CEO of the NRA, went on a book tour. I went to one of his book signings at a local mall. There were people lined up down the mall by the hundreds. Local media, print and broadcast, were walking up and down the line trying to interview folks and get quotes. To the last person, each looked at the reporter, said nothing, shook their heads no, then turned and ignored. Not one of us was under the illusion that they were honestly looking for our point of view. We knew, beyond a doubt, they were all looking for the stupidest goober they could find, the most outrageous quote they could mischaracterize, the worst misstatement they could possibly get, to make us all look bad."

That's how deranged their way of thinking is.
"Democrats protecting Iran, WTF"
"Of course there are democrats like that. But this is not your grandfather's, or even father's, democrat party. The base and leadership are socialists first and everything else (including Americans) second. They are totally dedicated to the destruction of anything (conservatives, republicans, independents, or moderate democrats) that stands in the way of their vision for America. They're even willing to destroy America first, if that's what's necessary, to remake it. The few in prominent positions that do speak out get harassed, shamed, threatened, primaried, and punished into silence. The press could mitigate this if they wanted to but they seem to be fully on board with the plan."
"I've seen less severe variations of this phenomenon four times. Each time, it preceded landslide election losses for democrats. After which, more moderate forces took over the party and brought it back to the mainstream."

"The Quds Force (Persian: سپاه قدس‎ sepāh-e qods) is a unit in Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specializing in  unconventional warfare and military intelligence operations. Responsible for extraterritorial operations, the Quds Force supports non-state actors in many countries, including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Yemeni Houthis, and Shia militias in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.Analysts estimate the Quds has 10,000–20,000 members. The Quds Force reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei. It was commanded by Major General Qasem Soleimani until he was killed by a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport on 3 January 2020."

<strong>2019-20 Iranian protests</strong>
"The 2019-20 Iranian protests (Persian: اعتراضات سراسری ۱۳۹۸ ایران‎) are a series of civil protests occurring in multiple cities across Iran, initially from a 50%–200% (approximately 6.5–19.5 cents US) increase in fuel prices, but included an outcry against the government in Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The protests commenced in the evening of 15 November and within hours spread to 21 cities as videos of the protest began to circulate online. Images of the violent protests were shared on the internet with protests reaching international levels.Although the protests began as peaceful gatherings, they soon turned into violent riots and revolt against the Iranian government. The Iranian government-employed tactics to shut down the protests including a nationwide internet shutdown and, according to Amnesty international, shooting protesters dead from rooftops, helicopters, and at close range with machine gun fire."

"I’m not mad that he’s dead, I’m worried this could start a war"
Do you really think Iran wants to go to war?   Just think about it.
[removed]
They’re going to have a revolution. I think they’re desperate enough to do some attacks. 
"Israel’s president is currently being indicted for something. If Israel is affected in the slightest, they will go to war. Their president is desperate for an excuse to unite his country and stop his trial. I predict they will join in if Iraq does anything close to attacking the us."
"I think they don’t want to declare war, they want us to declare war so they can roll out all of their propaganda about US imperialism blah blah blah etc and quell the protests and instability they are going through by painting US as the agressor"
"A war would be in no way and by no stretch of the imagination beneficial to them in any conceivable way. Their leaders are in a tough position right now because the plebs are calling for some kind of strong response. If they give it to them, they risk war.  End result - their country likely becomes a smoldering ruin and they are out of power.  I’d they don’t give it to them, they look weak and risk another revolution.  This was a genius move by our military."
"Well they aren’t in a great position rn, and the leaders are probably willing to take some risks. If it was a defensive war for Iran he could probably rile up support and maybe keep his regime intact, while otherwise the protestors will depose him"
Traditional war? Of course not.
Do you really think that shithole of a country wants war? They cant so shit to the United states. You have no need to to worry.
You're incorrect. They sure as shit can.
I'm correct. The last thing iran wants is a war with the most powerful army in world history. The least that will happen is small skirmishes. In which the us will win.
"Skirmishes? What about Cyberwar, Terrorist Attacks, escalating WMD development, etc?"
Do you seriously think Iran is going to do anything to the us. We need to pull out of the area entirely imo. These morons in Iran aren't going to do anything. I'm just going to end this conversation. I have better things to do.
"I'll answer your question and bow out as well. Yes, I think they will CONTINUE to do things to us."
You have to be completely tone deaf to think this wont have any negative consequences on American interests/people in the region.
Di you really think theres going to be ww3. Anyone who believes that is quite retarded.
"It’s definitely not going to be ww3, Russia has no reason whatsoever to back Iran, but I think there is a possibility of a smaller war between just us and Iran"
The point making is that people fearing ww3 have no reason to fear a war that wont happen.
WW3? Of course not. Proxy War? Absolutely.
Some people did something. No big deal.
Wait. Hundreds of Americans ? Why am I just now hearing about this...
Because the left doesn’t want you to know the truth
"Hmm I’ve been checking out Breitbart and Daily Caller and every other news outlet on the right, and never heard a peep about this guy. How come?"
Because the real bad guys move in the dark and we don’t hear about them for a reason. 
"Beyond that, just because you’ve never heard of an international terrorist, doesn’t mean he wasn’t a bad guy."
"He was also a US ally in the fight against Taliban in 2001-2002, and against ISIS recently. I really don’t buy it how he was the worst guy in the world, looks like the WMDs bullshit all over again. Something the warmongers pull out if their heinies to justify a yet another war."
I am 100% against meaningless war and all that comes with it.
"But I have no remorse for a terrorist. And in the cases you mention (early 2000s and isis of late), his motivAtions primarily come from the fact that isis and the like were Sunni Muslims so let’s not go too far down the conspiracy path yet."
"I don’t know, I’ve never heard of those websites. If you go on his Wikipedia you will see the terror he has caused and whom he’s killed"
Who do you expect to report on that?
The more she talks the more it’s clear she hates America
Didn't we rescue this woman's family?
Did some people in Iran do something that you didn't like Ilhan Omar? Because we know that she's anti-American.
"The media's reporting on this is like summarizing ww2 as ""the US threatened, embargoed, and invaded Germany"""
The US bombed a historic city in an attempt to kill a well-known Third Reich scholar and author.
The US pressured an aspiring chicken farmer and passionate politician to commit suicide.
Of course she is. Because she is a snake
That’s cuz she’s with the Iranians
"The outrage from Democrats is so ridiculous.  You can't make this stuff up. Acting like they hope President Trump starts a war,rather than condemned the actions of these terrorist groups."
"I think the media is spinning the outrage (as usual) to make it a better story. I'm surrounded on all sides by democrats, whom all of which view Iran (et al.) similarly to my conservative friends."
"The disconnect I'm observing is that they don't trust the current administration further than they can throw it, and thus vastly more skeptical re motive. Conservatives aren't as mistrustful, although a good argument can be made that they should be."
"Obama orders the murder of bin Laden....leftists cheer. 
Trump orders the murder of soleimani....condemnation by the left - makes sense"
I can’t help but think she is brain damaged and brain washed. A dangerous combination in reality but in DC she’s become a DEM favorite
"All of the above, obviously. The wall is undefeated."
"Some people did something, who cares"
Geesh!!!  She’s really arrogant and  evil!!!
"To quote Ilhan Omar, the US is just ""some people doing something"" to others... so what's the problem?"
Why are terrorists being elected into U.S. government?
Democrats love them.
Of course she is!
"Act like something good is outrageous and people sort of believe you because they think, there’s no way she could be outraged if that were a good thing, right?"
THATS whats outrageous.
Omar should move to Iran and help those people.
I’m sure she is outraged. He’s on her team at the end of the day
"Some guy killed some guy, don’t worry about it"
Talk about impeachment.....in the real world we would start with her..then deportation!
"Unfortunately, this is clown world. As evidenced by all the ""republicans"" down voting you."
You can't deport legal US citizens
"You can deport people who committed immigration fraud, such as pretending to be married to your own brother."
"Sure can, the bitch came to the country under false pretenses.   I would love to see her thriving....in her own country!"
Did he kill Americans in America? Nope.
​
"If we weren't there in the first place, destabilizing the region and droning civilians, he wouldn't have killed any Americans at all"
"That's cool, Trump tries to leave the middle east and the left screams bloody murder about dumpf is wrong from leaving. "
"Trump doesn't leave the middle east and Americans get killed then it's ""Americans should have never been there in the first place."""
"No kidding, Trump is trying to pull out of the middle east but you lefties cry as soon as he tries to do it. You blame him for trying to pull out and then you blame him to being there. You don't care about the people in the middle east or americans all you want to do is use their dead bodies for your own political gain."
So I guess just fuck Americans abroad then right? 
Jesus these terrorist sympathizers are frustrating.
[removed]
"He has orchestrated the killing of thousands of civilians and planned plus carried out attacks on American civilian targets, killing hundreds, along with publically claiming more are going to occur. What about that doesn't scream terrorist to you?"
[removed]
"""There are no American civilian targets in the middle East."" What the fuck are embassies then? This alone is enough to tell me you're not even worth talking to and are simply a terrorist sympathizer."
Same same in my view.
We’re literally there at Iran’s request. Not to mention we’re not droning civilians we’re droning the insurgents that are torturing and raping them
Irans request? I don’t think you have got your history in order!
The CIA wanted a regime change that’s how the current Muslim government is in charge.  It’s about oil.  It’s always was. 
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/_WVtpao0KSM"" rel=""nofollow"">History of US intervention in Iran.  </a>"
Do you thinks it’s a bad thing Americans kill thousands of insurgents who have been killing and raping their way across the Middle East?
I disagree with the killing and intervening. If you think killing is good you have to check your religion.
I think it’s perfectly fine if not moral to kill terrorists and rapists. It’s the paradox of tolerance
Lol the left wants to TOLERATE murderers and rapists.
Killing for defense reasons is by my opinion something else than traveling across the globe and searching for bad people and killing them. 
"Soleimani was bad for the US interest and I understand it. 
So are a lot of American politicians for people in the Middle East. "
How would you feel if Iran used a drone on the Vice President if he was on an airport in Germany ? I think this is an act of war. And Iran will respond and so will America and we have another War for oil.
When has our Vice President killed hundreds of Iranians ? Their Vice President has killed hundreds of Americans and planned on killing many more fuck him im glad he’s dead
"How about the war in Irak ? With fake news and no resolution from the UN to Attack Irak for oil. 
The removal of Saddam made room for Isis."
Killing bad people is good
So we just let the insurgents kill and rape their way across the middle east and that's somehow better than intervening? When we have the ability to stop it?
That’s why the people in Iraq were actually out celebrating this piece of shits death? Get your head out of your fucking ass mate and wake the fuck up before you speak. If you kill an American abroad it’s no different than if they were in nyc or west bumble fuck Montana.

"During Bill Clinton's first mid term election, after democrats had spent 2 years galloping far left, everything in NC with an ""R"" next to it's name got elected. Folks who've been around a while are beginning to wonder if it's going to happen again, despite all the yankees who've moved in. And thus, 12 people wanting to be the Republican nominee. Plus its a republican leaning district."
Rumor has it that one of them has a history of abuse.

It hasn’t even been 24 hours. I think there is still time...
Wait a minute....do people ACTUALLY think Iran wants to go to war with us!?😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😭😭😭
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002</a>"
The most recent full US war exercise with Iran saw us losing terribly because of tactics we didn't plan for. War with Iran would fuck both countries up but the swamp is gonna go for it anyway to enrich themselves.
Then use some different tactics.
"I’m so glad I’m subscribed to this subreddit, all my left wing sources don’t sound like this. It’s nice to read both."
"Iran: ""we will declare war!"""
Also Iran: doesn't declare war
What are they gonna do we could send their ass back to the stone ages
"To be fair, it’s already there.... 😜"
"Afghanistan, yeah pretty much. "
"Pre-invasion Iraq?  Ehh, more like the 70’s... not quite stone age. "
"Iran however is pretty modern though,  If this conflict escalates, it will be significantly more involved than our other engagements in the region and no one should be excited at that prospect."
Lmfao  I can’t argue that it would be a cake walk a bunch of conscripts vs a professional army
The Ayatollah of Diet Coca Cola
Unfortunately I'm scared this was the start of a dangerous game. There is still time for them to react dramatically. War is a dangerous game that gets the innocent people killed we should do all we can to avoid it!
"I can't see any strategic benefits from removing him other than feeling good about killing a ""Bad Guy"". An escalation that could potentially put so many more sons and daughters in harms way. "
"I'm trying to look at the big picture and understand what's the end game is. US put the maximum pressure on Iran to force them back to the negotiation table, but with what happened I doubt there will be any, anytime soon."
[removed]
That's just an ignorant comment
That man was a warlord. He was a vital asset to Iran strategies and inspiration to their army.
"He has been inciting wars in Lebanon, has ties to Hezbollah and who knows what else. "
"Killing him saved American lives in the long run.
Iran has to save face and spout retaliation. We were quiet when 911 happened so what were the options? Bribe them to so they could spend the money to kill our allies or kill the mastermind who has been inciting it?"
Good for Trump and the world having that piece of shit in a million pieces. America is ready and we will not tolerate religious fundamentalism slaughter of innocents.
"The big picture is that the Ayatollahs are corrupt, inept and unpopular.
There have been huge protests in multiple Iranian cities where protestors are chanting the name of the Shah ( in exile)."
The rulers are trying to provoke the U.S. into an invasion to stir up nationalism in the people and save their regime.
"Trump has said the U.S.  will not tolerate any attacks and ignored the drone shoot down.
When they killed a contractor in an unprovoked rocket attack, DJT killed the leader of the PMF.
When the PMF attacked our embassy (which is part of American territory) Trump responded with assassinating  General Qassem."
"Measured yet forceful responses, short of war, The General was hated in Iran as a warmonger oppressing the people. The Ayatollah gets a loss of face and anti government forces are emboldened."
End game is regime change by Iranians themselves. No U.S. invasion. No Iraq war version 2
"Is it possible/likely that if Iran were to retaliate, they would be backed by Russia? What would that mean for us?"
Trump and Putin have a lot of respect for one another. Our relationship with Russia has never been better. Russia getting involved is nothing we have to worry about.
Iran has 0 aircraft carriers and no long range bombers.  They have no ICBM missles.  They also have no military bases outside of Iran.  Safe to say we have no issues on US soil other than some deranged Iranian americans who might get salty.  That being said Isreal might get fucked with but we will be there to support them with airstrikes intelligence etc.
Dirty bombs are a thing.
"You clearly missed my entire point, are they going to teleport it to the US then?"
"It might cause fear, and decay, but percentage wise it’s a minor cut.  For example 9-11, 3,000/300,000,000  = 1/100,000 = .00001 = .001%.  We’re such pussies these days. We could crush them."
[removed]
Wait did we have war on US soil in those conflicts?
Worked out perfectly. We have tons of veterans that are deeply cared about
"Most Iranians in the US hate their government, that’s part of the reason why they fled Iran"
You are right about that but there will always be the crazy few.
Alright noob!  What a joke!
And to think Obama give them billions of our tax dollars to be used against us.  They should claw back Obama’s pension for shire stupidity!
Might as well keep giving billions to corporations and the MIC.
Better than the Mullas!
Exactly what an incel would say!
Why don’t you go live with them in Syria then?  Maybe then you would respect our great MIC. Keeping your lame ass safe!
You mean our great Resource allocation unit?

"Yet every time he tries to pull out Troops, the leftist freak the fuck out. Like how the Kurds were all going to be massacred after Trump pulled Americans out (Big hint: it didn't happen, just more leftist fear mongering). Trump literally cannot win with you leftists douchebags."

Major foreign leader? Bro that’s an enemy combatant with American blood on his hands.
[removed]
He wasn’t a government leader. He was a head of a terrorist organization. If you paid any attention you would realize that the Iranian people wanted him gone and are celebrating his death. Doesn’t matter if he’s a in a government position anyway if he’s killed Americans. That’s war.
[removed]
Just the ones that literally just attacked and were planning imminent future attacks ok little one.
"He was in Baghdad organizing the attacks that had just killed an American. If someone attacks us, we have the right to kill them. But, apparently you’re in high school and think the world is made of chocolate and unicorns."

Oh no it’s retarded
Edit: also literally in high school look at his post history lol

Coming from the <del>guy</del> kid arguing that an enemy general isn’t a valid military target?
What war are we in?
So much better to take the Obama/Hillary route and just let the Americans die. Easier to blame it all on a YouTube video anyways.

This article literally read my mind
"I am so sick of watching the masses try turn this in America, they love to champion peace and protect criminals from cops, but the second a group of terrorists come into question, their all lives matter beliefs disappear only to come back to defend the terrorists, it boggles me, but just like black lives matter and Antifa, they will support domestic terror groups and those who would cause disruption and problems in the street, so it doesn't surprise me I guess."

Care to show me where you found he was found to not be an imminent threat?
"Considering the other guys replies are deleted, can you fill me in on the conversation, did he try saying America wouldn't be able to completely destroy Iran?"
"Nah.. he said yeah, America will bomb Iran indiscriminately and kill all their civilians too. Then he said that the US are war criminals since we attacked an airport, and all the embassy accusations were proven false. "
Then I think he googled it and found out he was wrong.
"What a fool, what's done is done and a tyrant has been removed from this Earth, perhaps another will take his place but let's hope this is enough to bring some form of peace to Iran, even for a short period of time"

They should impeach pelosi
"Members of Congress can't be impeached. They can be expelled or recalled, but not impeached."
"Dammit no, that's what those morons want, to play the victim card."
Or they might actually pass the articles onto the senate and trump will legally be impeached. I'd prefer if it stayed in limbo tbh
Unless trump gets voted out in 2020 it’s going to happen eventually. I think the democrats are hoping against hope that they somehow swing the senate before they officially send the articles
[removed]
He already is. Impeachment simply means charges are brought up. It’s a common misconception that impeachment means removed. It’s also a common misconception that impeachment means a full House vote...which is why it’s generally accepted that Nixon “wasn’t impeached”. But in reality we’ve had four impeached Presidents not three. No where in the definition of impeachment nor in the Constitution does it specify where the official line is of “being impeached”. Therefore...by definition and by the Constitution...a President is “impeached” officially once the charges are brought up and voted on by committee. 
Trump is impeached. Nixon was impeached. Nixon quit before he could be fully voted on. And Trump has zero chance of being removed by the Senate. 
And...side note...the Dems wrote one of the articles as “obstruction of justice”...at what point is holding the articles from a vote obstruction of justice. 
Another side note...and something that shows you how shit Democrats are...they’ve tried to impeach every GOP President since Eisenhower.
Wasn’t it Obstruction of Congress? Which isn’t even a thing?
"Obstruction of congress is a thing and has associated penalties, but they’re rarely enforced."
Link to it then
"Dude, did you even bother typing it into a search engine? I’m not even American and I’ve got a better understanding of your laws than you do.<br/>
Don’t be such a lazy bastard. Look I’ll even make it easy for you, it’s 18 U.S.C. 1505"
Thanks. I'll take a look. Happy new year. Maybe your resolution should be to not be an asshole.
"Link to it then<br/>
 <br/>
I know you’re American, but do you not understand how entitled and lazy that is? The “then” in your comment implies disbelief, as opposed to something like a simple “Could you send a link?”. Then there’s the fact that you obviously have access to the internet and thereby the means to search for it yourself. Plus given that it’s relating to US law, there’s no ambiguity in the search, because the legislation is publicly available.<br/>
 <br/>
Tl;dr you implied that I was wrong and expected that I should have to prove it and provide you with the results, rather than typing 23 characters into google yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps your New Years resolution should be to stop being so lazy and actually show some initiative."
It’s literally something House Dems made up that doesn’t even have a legal code lol. Whatever Obstruction it was...which yeah must’ve been of Congress because Obstruction of Justice definitely has legal code.
"No it’s not. It’s <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505"" rel=""nofollow"">18 U.S.C. 1505</a>"
"No, it means basically the same thing. There is a lot of misinformation and its hard to keep things straight."
[removed]
But that’s not what legally impeached means.
This can play out in 3 ways. 
1) The democrats will cry corruption and play the victim card as they always do
2) The left will wake up and ask why Pelosi delayed the AOI.
3) Pelosi will be forced to turn over the AOI and the real fun can begin.
They’re going to claim corruption and play the victim card no matter what happens.
"McConnell openly admitted that he would ignore any evidence against the president, no matter what the facts say. I'd call that pretty corrupt."
"You guys are living in a dream world while the rest of us are unwillingly caught up in, yet eagerly watching the death throws of the Republican party. We know it's going to continue to get worse as you become more desperate, willing to grasp at anything, even resort to violence, to defend your party and Racist Cuckold in Chief's baseless arguments, until there's nothing to grasp at. Like a trapped beast, desperate, confused and scared, this will be when you are your most dangerous, but despite it all, you will be left behind by history, which will lable your movement an impish fad and move on. "
Happy New year!!
What is most be like to live in a leftist fantasy world like yourself. Happy News Years to you as well you poor MSM brainwashed soul.
"It's funny you guys still rag on MSM while simultaneously spreading conspiracy theories and lies that originated from... Fox ""news"", ya know.... MSM."
"I despise Fox News. They hired Donna Brazile, they are just as bad as CNN."
Nice Strawman though
"CNN is extremely biased and an embarrassment, but Fox ""news"" is straight up lies and state sponsored propaganda with a couple facts peppered in the mix."
straight up lies and state sponsored propaganda 
"Agreed, but CNN also falls under this category."
[removed]
"We are discussing MSM, but thanks for butting in with your TDS. Rent free"
Reality has a left leaning bias.
What does this even mean? Whose reality? 
To me it seems emotions are left leaning while FACTS are right leaning. 
"""To piss of a Conservative, lie to him. To piss of a Democrat, tell them the truth."""
Fact: the Republican party is dying any y'all know it. 
Fact: modern republicans don't win fair elections.
Fact: McConnell is corrupt.
Fact: ImPOTUS is a con man.
Fact: GOP is loosing grip on their base. 
"Fact: I'm wasting my time using facts because republicans would claim the Earth is flat if they thought it would help them win. No evidence necessary, just a well oiled propaganda machine."
"Wow, you and I have a completely different understanding of what a fact is. See a fact is something true and verifiable, not a delusional list like yours. "
How terrible to have such TDS that you actually believe all those points to be facts. Trump has a 95% support of the GOP right now. If you think that is wavering you are just ignorant. 
Fact: You are a loser trolling subreddits you don't agree with. Go outside and enjoy some time away from the internet. Might give Trump a chance to vacate your head lol.
So glad I voted for him: )
It's time to end this side show and get on to the real business of running our government.
"good for him, it’s time to put the shenanigans behind us and get back to basics."
[deleted]
"Hahaha, where’s the threat? He has a case pending in SCOTUS. The Senate will not convict on numbers alone, because Of the shit way this was managed in the House. Trump is not losing sleep over this."
"The biggest irony, is that the Democrats (Pelosi in particular) have themselves are guilty of abuse of power (frivolous use of impeachment) and obstruction of congress (not releasing the articles of impeachment to the senate, thus obstructing them from carrying out the due process).<br/>
I honestly don’t know why anyone would vote for them. Over the last 4 years, they’ve ignored the outcome of the election and now they’re trying to reverse it. That’s the type of behaviour you’d expect in a dictatorship. The Steele dossier and spying on Trump’s election campaign, should have been enough to reveal them as the authoritarian hypocrites that they are."

I'm pretty certain almost every Democrat in Congress is criticizing Trump for it. There's nothing unique about Omar's criticism.
"Assuming that this article is true, she made this public comment on Twitter.  She’s a critic.  If she can dish it out, she can take it.  She’s a big girl and she signed up for this.  What’s good for the goose is good for the gander."

Trumps stations come from their continued growth of it nuclear program. Anther reason he pulled from the illegal Iran deal. They were directly going against it. They have also been expanding their presence through the middle Rostand destabilizing the region.. Not to mentions of the threats of an ICBM.

"When is the world going to realize that the United States of America will enter any country that aids or partakes in terrorism to free humans from horrible actions and people? They aren't going to let you slaughter your own people,  or innocent people just because you tell them to go away because you dont want them there. They defend the weak, the defenceless, the oppressed, and the innocent and that will never change. They are the united states of america and terrorists have good reason to fear them. This man was taken out because he was a big part of taking the lives and freedoms of alot of innocent people. Dont whine about it, learn from it. Nobody is telling you to become a terrorist. If you want to stop being a terrorist, and stop being on the USA governments hit list because maybe you were forced to commit the acts by a government or group, or maybe you just dont want to be evil anymore, go ahead and give the american government Phone call I'm sure they will help you stop. If you dont care and WANT to keep causing pain and death for innocent people, well the USA is still going to help you stop, but you dont stand a chance at being recognized as a reformed terrorist, you're going to go down in history as a Dead terrorist. If you're a terrorist and the USA havent gotten you yet? Dont worry, be patient. The USA will get to you as soon as they can."

The only reactions I care about are those of the families of the men and women killed by this terrorist.
"On November 27, 2008 I lost my best friend Spc Ben Garrison to an EFP mine provided to Iraqi terrorists by Solemani. I spent my 25th birthday putting my friend in the ground because of this asshole.

What did they think would happen?
It's not just Virginians. If you live in a neighboring commie state and relied on Virginia being free to get your own stuff you're spending big too.
Cash is king
"Don't worry, they'll still vote those Democrats back into office because people are fine with rights being eroded so long as they have free stuff."
Worst part is they don't even get the free stuff... Just the expenses and the promise of free stuff might come down the line.
"Only helps if the LGS owner is down with burning the 4473s rather than turning them over. Doing so would mean the loss of his FFL (and therefore his financial security) and would probably mean he spends some time in jail. If he turns them over, there’s nothing stopping the staties from coming to collect whatever isn’t turned in."
"Maybe republicans will riot and burn down gun stores? I mean, the dems riot over basically everything"
"Yeah, but then we’d be guilty of the same thing as they always are, attacking the businesses of our friends and neighbors. If republicans are ready to riot it should be targeted at the Aholes who put you in a position to choose between a friend’s business, or going to jail for keeping your property."

I would love to see  this scene in a movie -
Camera is zoomed  in on Beto ORourke's face. 
"Beto ""I'm coming for you guns!"" "
You hear 100 clicks.
"Camera pans out, revealing Beto surrounded by gun barrels pointed at his face."
"Beto ""Come on guys, I was just kidding!"""
"What did they expect? All these shootings keep happening, what did they expect people to just buy pocket knives and hope for the best?"

"This seems like an insane act, how did no one stop this order, it could cause a war."
Edit: He reportedly had ties to the embassy attack.
It won’t. Iran can not afford a war.  The Ayatollahs just murdered 1500 protesters.  They cannot wage a war and suppress their population in the same time.
From another thread:
"Iranian sources in Iran are warning that killing Gen. Qasem Sulaimani spells war. ""Official reaction will begin with a strike,"" one says. #Iraq"
"<a href=""https://twitter.com/farnazfassihi/status/1212916086057897987?s=19"">https://twitter.com/farnazfassihi/status/1212916086057897987?s=19</a>"
I've done more reading an it appears he was sponsoring the militia that attacked the US embassy. This should be interesting how this pans out.
"So really all Iranian officials can do is sit back and say how much they hate the west? Couldn’t they still technically cause havoc to the embassy I’d they tried? Do you know how the people of Iran have reacted to the news, I’m trying to find sources or videos and I can’t find any."

"Yea, that’s the problem. No one likes abortions, it’s just people have different levels of understanding of how to deal with unwanted pregnancies."
"I mean, there are people who have either become pro-choice or more pro-choice after pregnancy."
"There is one political party that wants free abortions on demand...Democrats. Never forget that. Some people love killing human life, others don't. The ones that love killing human life just happen to almost always be liberal and democrats."
[removed]
"Seems more like an appeal to emotion than a scare tactic, but I see your point"
Why would it frighten anyone?
Idk it's statistically actuate to say liberals are pro choice .... And they abort more babies than pro life .... So chances are baby needs to pray for a republican momma haha
[removed]
"Yes, it is statistically accurate. There are no studies that say democrats do it more than republicans, but all the trends imply that they do. African American women are almost 4 times more likely to have abortions than white women, Hispanics maybe 2 times. Both groups lean very very left. Households where the parents are unmarried are more likely to have abortions... again, they are also more likely to be democrats. People in cities are far more likely than people who live in more rural counties, again, city residents are far more likely to be democrats. Younger people have more abortions than older people... again. All the demographics of abortion fit much more to the demographics of democrats."
That is not to say democrats are evil or that all or even more of them are for abortion. It is simply obvious that democrats are much more likely to have abortions.
My opinion is that abortions are like guns: If they're illegal then people will just get them illegally.
I’m pro guns pro choice pro weed and pro trump. Don’t lump all Republicans into the pro life category
"Same! I don’t care that much, but I might not be pro-weed, personably."
You don’t care until you get the wrong person pregnant. Then you all of a sudden become an immediately pro choice
Right there with ya!
I wish ur mom practice pro choice on you
She did that’s why he is alive
How very pro-life of you

Abortion joke

"You have a good stance. But the quality of life is priceless, the suffering is hypothetical. And coming from someone who knows this subject personally from experience with it. There's always more then suffering. Theres the people you meet and person you become. It took a poor family to birth a Michael Jordon. Same goes for the likes of bill gates. Mark zukerburg. Etc. So saying that suffering is something they'd face is true. But isn't it something we all do? And we're still here too"
"Obviously all people face some sort of suffering, what does that have to do with forcing women to birth children into shitty situations?  Foster care systems are already overflowing, there's already so much pain and suffering. All I'm hearing you say is, why not add more?"
"Thats all your taking the time to analyze. The fact of the matter is, in most cases its a female who shouldn't if done what she did and she doesn't want what follows. Not only does abortion beat the purpose of learning the consequences. But also a whole life that has limitless capabilities in an situation. So your whole point is invalid due to the fact that any one from any circumstances can make the absolute best out if their lives"
"What's all I'm taking the time to analyze, the pain and suffering / shitty situation the baby will be born into? The fuck do you mean? Of course that's all I'm analyzing.  That's the god damn point, read the quote again maybe it didn't resonate the first time...  People who are ready to have children, have their children.  Nobody is contemplating abortion for the hell of it.  you'd rather a child born into a broken home? No money? poverty no food? Says a lot about you.  You also lost all credibility at ""in most cases"". You don't know shit and that's one hell of an assumption"
"I'd bet 100 bucks you're a dude.  And if you're not, then you want control over your uterus and all other females uteruses too ...?"
"My whole point is invalid? Fuck, project much? Get the fuck out of here. Leave women and their uteruses alone.<br/>
Republicans don't want to fund anything, they want people to give birth and nobody gives a fuck what happens after.  Shame shame shame"
"Do you hear yourself? You think that as a consequence to sex, somebody should be forced to raise a child they aren't really ready for?"
"I can't force you to grove, but please don't let the music stop"
"Your whole case is an assumption, idk what kind of mob spawner people like you come from, but its one that needs to stop."
Bold of them to assume that a baby in poverty with no way out will go through what a poor people go through amirite?
"Don’t have sex without condoms in the first place. There are plenty ways to prevent getting pregnant in the first place. Abort earlier. Republicans aren’t completely against abortion just against really late abortion, or even killing the baby right after it’s born."

"The wording of this law is much like the way medical marijuana works. For any reason you can get an abortion up to the woman going into labor and pushing the baby out so long as it ""endangers the health of the woman"" or it is ""not viable"". If the woman just has anxiety about being a mom, there's your reason. There is no one overseeing this. You could kill a baby ready to be born. That is messed up."

"So what? If something is true, don't be scared of it because you think people won't like it."
Omg my kids call me boomer all the time..  I think it’s a sensitive thing to post.
Oh man these comments are a treat
Personally i am against abortion since i have my shit together. But not in all cases. If i had a 15 16 year old daughter i'd be for it. Since she whould still need to focus on school and getting her life on track.
I am however ALWAYS against abortion to just be used as anti conception replacement for the pill or condoms.
And the person wanting one. Should always pay out of pocket. Its a privelidge not a right.
"I think that it depends on the case. If someone is sexually assaulted, then carrying the baby can have negative psychological effects and the baby may not be loved. If someone has a child by mistake, then you shouldn’t kill someone else to fix your mistake. I don’t think that abortion should be outlawed nor allowed whenever, I think you have to judge it case by case."
Who should do the judging?
The pregnant woman and her medical team
Is that not the status quo
"In many places, yes. Which, in my opinion, is how it ought to be"
[removed]
Even then you still don't deserve to die! and trying to tell or convince somebody that their life is worthless or it's going to be worthless and that they should have been aborted means you're a horrible person! Just because your life isn't going the way you wanted to doesn't mean it's everybody else is fate

"Free markets aren't built around that... free markets are built around the principle that I can own my stuff and freely trade it with whomever I want for whatever we agree to. That is it. Because people sometimes cheat that system, you claim the system is built around something it is is not. It is a dishonest representation of free markets."
"Surely you see that what you are talking about is COMPLETELY different, and thus not applicable as an argument, for two reasons:
1. Raising an animal is worlds apart from bringing a human to this Earth. It is 5-10 years commitment of your time for an animal, compared with 18+ years of having a child. 
2. When a woman has a child, she has something GROWING INSIDE OF HER. I think she should be able to decide if and when she is ready to have this happen for her. What you are talking about is... I think a dog being bred?"
FYI I am a man; one who believes that women should be able to choose whether they let something grow in their bodies.
My mom is pro choice conservative so I’d say I’d hope she’s pro-life

"I also hope I’m not threatening my mothers life by being here, hope I’m not the result of a stupid decision my mom made when she was 13 and in no position to care for me financially or emotionally, hope I’m not inside a crack addict right now, hope I’m not stricken with an incurable illness or genetic disorder that will cost my parents their life savings and sanity when they have to watch me die in a NICU a wee after being born, I hope I’m not... the list of situations where a child would be either dangerous to the mother or an objective burden on society goes on for miles.  About 600K miles, according to your chart.  At 300M Americans, let’s say 150M women, that’s 0.4% getting abortions.  We’re already an overpopulated world, let’s give these moms some credit in deciding whether or not their lives and society as a whole would be better off with their baby in it."
So should we kill all those children of parental mistakes? Should we kill all financially burdensome people? Should we kill all people with difficult diseases to deal with?

"No get a job, get insurance. Condoms are free at the health clinic birth control you can get that for free or next to nothing most of the time. Downvote all you want but i dont get into a car accident and expect the tax payer to cover the damage to my vehicle, there’s no reason why tax dollars should be used for people being irresponsible.
You’re essentially saying having a child makes you impoverished which isn’t true at all. I know people who have had kids and gone on to do much better things with their life they would’ve never done if they didn’t have kids."
I guess poor people can't have joy or the desire to live. Nor can they better their lives...
I would hate for you to make decisions for poor people just trying to make a life for themselves. Your idea is just let them die.

You mean to tell me that when a US embassy is attacked we should... respond with force? Waaaah?!?
"The best part is that force has not been needed so far. The attack in Benghazi and this attack were quite different --Benghazi attackers used small arms and RPGs from the get-go IIRC, whereas here I've only heard that they smashed up the reception area and set fire to it, as well as threw rocks at security. "
"So far there have been no injuries on either side at the embassy itself, and no personnel evacuated (besides nonessentials who were evacuated days ago). "
"It seems all that was needed was to beef up security and fly in some mean looking helicopters (AH-64s) to shoot flares. The militiamen left the Green Zone already. However, since all of these people are from different militias it is possible there will be more of a response."
The problem is that people on the left were hoping this would turn out like Benghazi so they started calling it Trump's Benghazi without even bothering to make sure the comparison made sense. It was just lazy.
Lets hope there are no more attacks
Those people are nuts
Amen.
"This is why he's our president. He doesn't let our own Americans behind in the hands of the enemy, and immediately responded to this by sending in our American Warriors(Marines) in to rescue our people at the Embassy. Shows us more than Obama ever did with Benghazi, when he just went to bed and didn't send our guys any air support or anything to help them when they absolutely needed it."

"Yeah, 4 American patriots didn’t die in Trump”s Benghazi."
Good. Hope all the attackers were mowed down mercilessly the way they hoped to do to our people.
"Obama is a Muslim, practicing or not. His father was a Muslim,he was raised in the Islamic faith and his treatment of our Muslim advisaries proves it."
"We bring in the troops, and the crowd quickly disperses.  'Nuff said'."
"I have no doubt that 45 will track them down and take care of business. The perps know that too and knew better than to use more than just small arms and Molotov cocktails, etc. If a single RPG was used then it would mean total destruction to a lot of sights in Iran and some in Iraq."
"Unlike Obama, President Trump is not asleep at the wheel or a Muslim."
It IS relevant!!  He was out to destroy our country!!!  He gave muslims all over the edge...  he took out two dictators to let muslims take over countries!!!  He was a Muslim and NOT a US born citizen.

I hope they keep comparing it to Benghazi. 
Obama and Hillary let them die. Trump immediately sent Marines to reinforce them and the 82nd Airborne is on their way.

"I was waiting for someone to say what about, Trump. Happy to see a respected comment. "
His tone has become more presidential. I dont always like what he says or how he says it but he has done an outstanding job in his first term.
"Very excited at the prospect of helping out the poorly run Democratic cities and showing people what the Republican party is all about, community, accountability and prosperity."
Literally all he has to do is campaign on how poorly run the democratic cities are and promote community and its an easy win
Agreed. Sanders keeps going on how we need an economy for every man woman and child and we already have it.
They really dont have any talking points beyond the climate crisis.
"To be fair, it is a concern and I do listen but jumping to the Green New Deal which is conscripted socialism is a detriment to their cause."
I am willing to listen but anything that infringes on our liberties is a mute point.
Great article and I expect most of these will come to fruition.
Trump will win the democrats have made sure of that.

"She is preaching doom. She is propaganda. She is being used and she is demonizing people and categorizing them as enemies when their stances are actually reasonable. Trump is not anti-environment neither are republicans at large. The environment actually benefits from a more advanced culture, the environmental impact of the US has declined greatly as we have learned to do more with less and that is almost entirely a result of the free market which Trump is defending. Thunberg is making Trump out to be an enemy when him just letting the free market do what it does is actually doing more for the environment than someone like Obama pushing regulations that just lead to corruption or misuse of funds."

Old saying my dad used to say: An armed society is a polite society.
The guy was a hero. Fair play to him.
"Sometimes when I am shopping at a mall or store, I think to my self (1) where are the back exits and (2) I hope to god another shopper is carrying a firearm because there is no way in hell I am waiting for cops to arrive if shit hits the fan. Im either going down trying to escape or supporting my fellow armed peers to end the threat. Waiting for cops to enter the active shooting zone is not one of my options"
I am just happy to live in a country where I don’t even have to think about this.
If you let people defend themselves they actually do it ? *gasp* who would've guessed ! Certainly not Biden.
"Haven't I read that people who CC are statistically the safest fun owners around?  Seems I read they're even ""safer"" than off duty police officers.  "
"Funny thing mass murderers, they usually don't spend the time and expense, and ate not willing to undergo a background check.  "
"I'm reminded of my neighbor's take on firearms, he's a retired police Chief.  When folks ask him about the ""statistics"", he says the one that is hard to find, if at all - is how many lives are saved, women NOT raped - because when a bad guy sees a homeowner <em>just pointing</em> a gun their way, immediately flee.  Another cop friend of mine suggests folks who aren't likely to practice at the range regularly, buy a shot gun.  Without getting into the debate of handgun vs. shotgun, he said his anecdotal experience taught him bad guys are scared shitless of a big ass shotgun, and more so when they hear the shotgun being pumped."
Apparently no one had a gun at the last Wal Mart.
Good luck Bloomberg. This just blew your chances of buying Texas like you did Virginia

really concerning article... guess i’m moving to ireland soon
Did y’all see the two cnn articles on this? I’ve never seen so much stupid false shit written in my life. One paragraph read that it’s not illegal to buy a gun as a felon in Texas. Straight up false jibberish.
I believe there is a Texas statue that allows a felon to own (maybe just in their home) a gun if they have been off parole or out of jail for 5+ years or something like that. Like always though federal law supersedes state law and you can still be charged federally.
"<a href=""https://www.khou.com/mobile/article/news/local/verify/verify-can-a-felon-legally-have-a-gun-in-texas/491829268"" rel=""nofollow"">News article about it.</a>"
"Been saying this for years. The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. When you outlaw guns, only outlaws have guns. "
I killed an armed home invader inside my own home. Didn't go to jail for it. I saw someone in a parking lot pull a gun on someone once because the guy stole his parking space. I drew my gun and stopped him from killing the other guy. 
"There's an extremely good reason why there's no school shootings in Texas. The teachers are licensed to carry concealed firearms. Nobody wants to walk into a building full of armed shooters, they want a free shooting gallery, which is why most cowards choose elementary schools. "
More guns in the hands of law abiding citizens = less crime. The fear of death is often greater than the desire to commit an unlawful act.  Period.
There have definitely been school shootings at the secondary and primary school levels in Texas.
For example -
"<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_High_School_shooting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_High_School_shooting</a>"
I don't think anyone needs to be reminded of the university shootings.
"With that being said, a well-cared for and well educated society will do infinitely more for a community than simply throwing more guns at the problem. I don't mind if people that are well vetted carry, but I'm not going to pretend like that solves everything."
Beto O Rourke just dropped more acid.
Good
"I really dislike the title to this thread, and feel it’s misleading and incorrect. "
The law didn’t prevent it. 
"A well armed, well trained citizen prevented that mass shooting. No law has prevented a shooting, only prevented citizens from defending themselves against one. There should be no law preventing concealed carry, or ‘allowing it’, it’s a god damned right to defend yourself, the ‘law’ is supposed to prevent the government from infringing upon said right."
It kills me how democrats and others are saying he should have waited for the police to take care of the job. 
"I moved to Nevada because it was still fairly conservative but am finding more and more that I want to move, this is due to the fact that so many people are leaving the state of California that they have already ruined beyond all hope. Anytime that I post in <a href=""/r/Vegas"" rel=""nofollow"">/r/Vegas</a> etc I get massive down votes due to this."
I wish if the left could understand this.

Its nice to see someone actually gives a shit about our folks over seas. Better than the Benghazi shit show under obama bin ladins admin.
"This very well could've been another Benghazi, except our President responded exactly like he should've and sent in our Marines to rescue our people. That's what a true leader does for our country. He doesn't leave our people behind in the hands of the enemy, like Obama and Clinton did where we lost 4 Americans and they didn't send in any air support or Armed Forces to help them."
Imagine how helpless they felt? Nothing like having the support of the president and the friggin u.s military behind you.

Sounds like they are admitting how Benghazi should have gone with competent leaders in charge.
"Jesus Christ, people in this country actually believe the horseshit spewed by the left on Twitter and CNN. Trumps Benghazi? GTFO here. Love him or hate him Trump is the best thing to happen to this country since Regan. His accomplishments and stats prove it. All these nay sayers just can’t get over the fact Hillary lost and that feminist they were buttering up for 8 years of Obama wouldn’t let them touch her bathing suit parts. It’s truly astounding that with technology, and the more the worlds information is at our fingertips, we have just overwhelmingly gotten dumber as a society."
It is a big mistake for Dixiecrats to bring up Bengazi...The hash smoke has made them forget that is why Shillary lost...

"not becoming, it is."
"Live there, can confirm"
So why was he re-elected???
"Because the left in the state have an irrational fear and hatred of the right. I don't live in NYC anymore, I live upstate. But it is interesting to read the threads of my home town. The Republicans in my area pulled some political strategy that was frankly a bit unbecoming, but the strategy served a purpose. They were trying to limit what the incoming county executive could do by reducing the threshold of money expenditure that triggers a review by the county legislature."
"Anyway, the democrats obviously took this personally. And honestly, it was a bit underhanded though the fears of the republicans that led to their move was valid, it's just that the move looked so underhanded because it was done at the last minute. The incoming dem county exec wants to implement some very expensive programs. And this state is already going to hell with the taxes and state leadership. So the republicans seemed to think this would be a good idea. They were blasted by the local media."
"Anyway, my point is that they know Cuomo is corrupt. They know most of the state is corrupt. They know the state has been run by Democrats almost completely consistently for decades now save for a couple terms of a Republican governor. They know the promise of ""free college"" is fraught red tape and isn't the gift Coumo made it sound like. So I asked them why they wouldn't vote 3rd party or for a republican. They gave some strange answers that implied that they think Republicans are somehow more corrupt (when they haven't had control in forever except for some pockets of local governments), and that they hate republicans. So they would rather see the state burn than to hand it over to people who at least act like they want to be more fiscally responsible."
"Basically, it is the media. The media and a real echo chamber that rules the New York voter."
We use shithole in these parts.
"De Blasio is the worst, if not one of the worst mayors in the history of our country. He hasn't done a single thing as Mayor of NYC, and Governor Cuomo is an even worse Governor. Hell i live in the state of New York, and they're both shit."
Amen
"Hey how dare you say such a thing!?!?!?!? ""Dangerous Hellhole"" Ill have you know a dangerous hellhole is much nicer (and way cheaper) than NYC!"

Agreed. Media won't cover it either considering it doesn't fit their narrative. A damn shame.
Unfortunately liberals are flocking to Texas now and trying to turn it blue!
Pretty soon my Texas will be polluted and overpopulated 😟
I always thought Texans would fight back and this would never happen in a million years but here we are..
"I’m nog an american but this defense by the people is one of the most beautiful things i’ve seen. I really hope that if Trump doesn’t win, the left doent take this right from you!!"
"They won’t take out. They’ll write some laws, but it’s still ours. Writing laws and gaining compliance are two different things entirely"
"I'm a liberal, and I don't want guns to be taken away. This is a perfect example of why we need guns to save people. But... Guns were also the problem that caused the shooting. All I want Is to stop people like the shooter from getting guns."
The tool is never the problem. The left will try to sell it as the problem.
"Freedom requires that we trust each other, and trust leaves us vulnerable. There will always be people who abuse that trust and hurt others, with guns, with fists, with cars, with money, with words, with deception... etc. All of these tools used to hurt people are able to be used because we are free to use these tools. A compass in a math class is a tool, it is points and you could injure someone badly with it... we trust that people will use these tools appropriately and with the respect they deserve. But someone somewhere will undoubtedly use it to stab another student or accidentally hurt someone when they try to make it stick in the ceiling tile. The cost of that freedom to use that tool is the risk that someone will do something stupid with is."
"Guns are a very important tool. Guns allow the people to revolt should the government become a tyranny. Why do you think there are those in power who would like to remove guns from our world? Now many in power (like senators or congressman or state officials) might simply think as you do: that preventing these horrible events is worthy of finding some strong restrictions on guns... many go further though and believe all guns should be out of the hands of citizens. They do this with the good intention of wanting to prevent tragedy. However there are those in power, those who really have power, who know what guns really are. They are a tool that gives people power over rulers should those rulers turn on them. And these people use the fear of gun violence, and the wishful thought good intentions of people like you and all these congressmen and senators and such, to attain their goal of gun confiscation."
We cannot have freedom without the risk of people abusing it. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that stricter policies will do anything but hurt law abiding citizens.
"Im not living in the US and im following the election, who do you think will be the democratic candidate?"
"I mean, Biden is"" winning"" right now. So him most likely."
What was the motive anyone hear?
Closest I’ve heard was it was the 10th anniversary of his brothers suicide
"Seems to have missed the point, twice if my math is correct."
"I heard that he was a drug addict with severe mental illness and that the church gave him food but refused to give him money, so he came back in disguise and shot the place up."
Bloomberg and Watts hardest hit.
Damn that’s a strong ass gun
Msm will forget this on purpose now

Stand on someone's neck? It is standing on someone's neck to uphold your laws?
"This isn't some kind of imperialist act where we are going into their lands and kicking them out by force, they are coming here, not following our rules, and getting kicked out. Don't pretend this is tyranny when it is simply not allowing people to take advantage."
"I didn't downvote you, I hear what you're saying. But if someone doesn't like a law then work to get that law changed through the legislative branch and process."

“It’s the law of the land” when liberals like it.  “It’s our moral obligation to resist” when they don’t. Not everything you disagree with is an issue of morality.

Laws can just be broken or ignored on a whim if you are fed a feel good story to go along with it.  Is that how it works?

"So after disregarding our laws and slinking across the border in the middle of the night, what arbitrary number of years does one have to evade the authorities to gain this immunity.  Does reproducing during that time make that number less.  "
"Nonsense debate.  These people are here illegally.  You can “but the children” all day, but they are breaking laws.  And we all know the emotional arguments are just cover for the end game."
[removed]
So if you can get past border security then you’re free to go?  I suppose we should give them citizenship and the vote as well.  There’s the endgame.
"You realize virtually none of them ""slink across the border"" right?"
This is not true. They are caught constantly crossing the Rio Grande as well as many other places. There are those in Mexico who are paid by hopeful illegal immigrants to lead them across the border. It happens all the time.
It is dishonest to say it doesn't happen.
EDIT: typo
"The spirit of the law is to define specific immigration policy, not to make vague policy that is open to interpretation and can be swept aside if the offenders evade the authorities long enough and are “peaceful”."
"Yes, by citizens of that country."

breaking news washington post doesn’t like trump
Stop legitimizing that garbage propaganda rag formerly known as a news publication.
"What is funny is trumps son in law and his daughter is Jewish, yet these morons call him an antisemite."
They call him things they don’t understand themselves.
You mean MSM are trying to have it both ways? Shock Horror.
There is a war against Christians. Since its inception and nevermore than today. It’s a constant ongoing thing. Jews and Muslims take measures and have things in place to protect their religion. Why is it a problem when Christians do it?
Yep
Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe that’s why the Muslims hate us. Because we were founded on Christ’s bame
Hows about fight against anti-Christianity. We are constantly under attack and never acknowledged.

"Let's be real though, the majority of Christian persecution is not happening within the United States. The brand that Christians receive in the US is usually non-violent (with the exception being cases of church shootings), and is generally a feeling of intolerance or hatred. However, this could be argued for pretty much any religion within the US as we are becoming a more humanistic, atheistic society."
"Also, what this has to do with the article or Trump is a bit of a stretch. If we're going to take the side of the article, then they're not bashing Trump for being Christian, they're doing it because they don't like him and he's a Republican."
Edit: Added a link to an article about the shooting at the West Freeway Church of Christ.

"I think the advocation of hanging those we disagree with is fundamentally unrepublican. Our party was founded in staunch contrast to the lynching Democrats, after all."
Some people’s did some things
"If the point is to point out twitters hypocrisy, then it's 100 percent valid. "
"If it's to actually support this woman, ehh, I mean better than Omar. "
I'd like to just see someone defeat the anti semite on principle.
Side note : Louis Farakan is still on Twitter I believe.
She literally can't win without Twitter. The president figured that out and crushed it. Now Twitter is retaliating by controlling elections.
"It’s their platform, they can run it however they like. If you don’t like it, don’t use it."
You’re wrong because social platforms have claimed immunity under the “town square effect” where they are merely a platform for unfiltered speech. 
"As soon as they put their thumb on the scale in favor of an agenda and begin censoring free speech, they lose that protection."
"Exactly their rules are so arbitrary, its only offensive when they say it is, bit ilhan omar can bash jews all day if she wants."
[removed]
"I’m not defending her post advocating for hanging her opponent; I was replying to the comment that said “it’s their platform, they can run it how they want it”. "
"Since you mentioned it, there have been plenty of tweets calling for violence against Trump and Republicans without any suspensions happening. "
Weird huh?
[removed]
"The point is, when these platforms don’t enforce the rules equally for both parties, they should lose their immunity."
"Why? Section 230 says absolutely nothing about impartiality, just that platforms cannot be held liable for content created by their users. I'm not sure where this whole ""public square"" argument came from but it doesn't have any actual legal basis."
"This argument is so blatantly hypocritical that I'm embarrassed as a conservative that it is trotted out so much. In any other situation, the stance is that businesses should be allowed to operate as they see fit, but then in the  case where this causes an inconvenience for conservatives, there's immediately a push for regulation. "
"I think Twitter should be able to apply any arbitrary rules they want. The fact that they have a liberal bias doesn't change that. Anyone can start a public forum with whatever rules they want, like the one we're on right now, and that's how it should be. If you don't like Twitter's rules, then don't use it. Start your own public forum and garner a massive user base over the course of a decade, then you can apply the rules you see fit."
"We have to be morally and logically consistent, and arguments like this delegitimize the Republican party in my opinion."
What does that have to do with anything? I was just stating a fact. Whoever controls the most popular media outlets control the glow of elections.
They have a monopoly they are using against the best interest of the American people. They need to be broken up.
Omar is an outspoken anti Semite. But that’s ok with Twitter. Ugh
There was a reason it was suspended by Twitter! It's because they are left-wing commies.
Exactly theres a joe rogan episode on how biased of a platform they are.
Don't worry. It's not voter manipulation.

Cuomo and these legislators have to go. They are destroying this state and making it extremely unsafe to live in.

How have any of them involved in the various hoaxes and flat-out criminal acts escaped both scrutiny and conviction.

"Don’t believe polls, but don’t get too comfortable and assume others’ votes will be enough. GO VOTE"
"Not only that, getvothers to vote as well. Become active in your local GOP organizations. Fight for our party."
But everyone loves Trump?
"I agree 100%.  I’ve experienced the same thing over and over with leftists.  When Obama was President, if I disagreed with any aspect of any policy I was considered a racist.  I want lower taxes?  Racist!  I want a different foreign policy reaction to Syrian chemical weapon use?  Racist!  Less restrictive gun laws! Racist!  Equal standards for college admissions?  Racist!  "
Now that Trump is president (and I didn’t even vote for him) if I support any aspect of any policy I’m a racist.  If I state I’m glad the economy is doing well?  Racist Trump supporter!  If I like trying to stand up to Chinese intellectual property theft?  Trump supporting racist!  
And this is from members of my own family.  My step dad can’t talk about the day’s weather without blaming Trump and “arch” conservatives.  
I guess that’s what you get when you watch CNN all day and have no other sources of information.
"I actually voted for Obama, and I experienced some, not all, the things you said as I started to disagree with him. <a href=""https://youtu.be/0edW9A2Duds"">here is my #WalkAway video btw</a> It was part of the reason I left the democratic party. I find that the majority of conservatives/ Republicans (although not all) can disagree with you and enjoy a beer with you as well. Not so with the leftists who banish you to the cornfield. 
If you watch it, leave a comment for me if you enjoy or agree. Thanks for your thoughts on this matter and confirming we aren't alone in our thinking. 
I have a friend like your stepdad who hasn't cancelled me yet. Another one has."

"Honey you can't speak reason to sheep. Sheep have no empathy and no mind of their own.  These are little men who  set the world on fire to keep warm themselves after sheering. They have dilusions of grandeur, with the only self sacrifice being the slaying of their humanity."
"It will be 2016 on crack, with Trump receiving a larger percentage of the African-American and Hispanic vote, holding on to the white working class that broke for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and dominating the independents. The down vote elections will mean the Repubs will retake the House, possibly expand their Senate majority. RBG’s seat on the Supremes will finally come open, and it will be time to look at Thomas’s retirement after the 2022 midterms for the continued sanity and stability of the court through the mid-2030s."
"So true! So sick of the fake media narrative. This country has never been better than it had been under Trump, he's fixed so many problems and he's going to fix so many more. Everyone is doing so much better. 
Watch out for the crimson wave in 2020 demo's!.!!"
Hijacking your : recent info is coming up that the amount of  Illegals in this country was not 11 million but closer to 22 million
How do we know how many illegals are here?
Your question is almost rhetorical
Isn't this just basically admitting Republicans don't debate?
"No it’s saying that when we talk we get belittled, and so we stay silent. While I can talk plenty about any political subject and can do it politely, if you think you have moral high ground and treat me lesser because of it I’ll avoid you completely just to avoid drama"
"I live in a retirement community of mostly liberals. They speak so snidely about conservatives. I've been called everything under the son. Stupid, inbred, ignorant, moron, asshole, the list goes on. They don't know I'm conservative. "
I just smile and wait for my turn to vote. Boy are they going to be pissed when big T gets another term.
Itsfunnyish This.
"lol lol ... what are you talking about? Did you watch the video? How can you debate someone who states ""I hate everything you believe"" even when you are stating a fact of nature. Are you being sardonic? If so, I truly didn't get that."

"I, as a Conservative Orthodox Jew can say confidently that the left wingers don’t want to do anything about attacks against us. There are reports coming out that this attack in Monsey was another work of the Black “Hebrew Israelites”. But the liberals will never designate them as a terrorist organization, even though the JDL was designated as such near instantly. The Democrats are the real anti-semites. We, as religious Orthodox Jews, don’t like em."
"Well, I as a black Canadian left winger care a lot about you and your rights"
Doesn’t fit the “white people are evil and orange man to blame” narrative.

That's rich.
Literally EXACTLY what I was gonna type... lol
Not as rich as CEO's and board members under a far-right government
Or as rich as Bernie is
Typical leftist.  Accuse everyone else of precisely what the left has been doing all along.
on /politics the examples are legion.  Completely not self aware.
OooOooOooohh
"She is everyman's ex-wife.  Shudders, ugh."
Ol’ fucking Ramen Hair there really doesn’t have any room to say shit.  It’s because of her there was Clinton/Kaine.
This lady still around?
She should know what a rigged process looks like.
"Hey! You can't be fair to the president, we are trying to politically lynch him because we're upset that we lost the last election and are scared we will lose the next one"
How could anyone in their right mind still vote for this looniebin!?
"Wtf is happening.... thats like me taking a shit in your sun roof, and then saying you’re trying to shit in my sunroof... what the fuuuuuck"
That’s an oddly specific metaphor.
🤷‍♂️ sometimes you gotta dump in a sunroof... and then tel them they’re pooping in yours.
shes got some gall
Blabber mouth.
Distraction is not an easy disregard. She knows what she is doing. 
"FYI, California has grown in offering licenses to non citizens and as a result has picked up 11 more congressional delegates."
They know the game and want to win. Be vigilant.
11 more what?
Seats in congress. They are playing the numbers game is what I am saying.
Can you please vote when they added 11 seats in the US House that has been locked at 435 seats since 1911? Maybe you meant state house seats?
State. Sorry.
As Trump said its fake it will die and the democrats are just fooling themselves to think it will pass the senate.

"I would 100% agree with your comment 4years ago. Now I’m about 50% in agreement since the past 3years have shown democrats are extremely crooked. I believe in taking the high road, but so far the high road has moved the country towards socialism and I for can not accept that as an option. Nixon was one of the best presidents we ever had and he was taken down for the same exact bs the dems were doing. Now trump has been impeached for “presumptions” while we have video evidence of dems doing much worse. I’m sorry to say it, but the high road isn’t working when you are fighting lunatics."

"It’s important to point out that every democrat said Trump had no chance of beating Hillary, and here we are."
I don’t think any election is “handed” over and don’t want to be in the cocky / shocked stage like dems were.
"This. Get ready to fight tooth and nail, because they will use every last dollar, dirty backdoor deal, threat of blackmail, and even violence to prevent Trump from staying president."
"He slammed her left and right on big bank payouts. What could he possibly have on Bernie. That Bernie stands for most of the things he lied about giving us in 2016? Taking on big pharma, saving social security, taking on  Goldman Sachs and draining the swamp."
I remember during the West Virginia primaries in 2016 news stations were asking people who they supported. People were supporting Bernie. When asked who they planned on voting for if Bernie didn’t get the nomination they answered with Trump.
"It was also the awful way the DNC treated Bernie, so they voted Trump out of spite. "
"I believe, had the DNC been completely fair from start, Bernie could have won the nomination over Hillary. Even if he lost, it would have been fair so the Bernie voters would have more likely accepted Hillary. Too bad the DNC did the opposite. "
"The RNC despised Trump at first, but at least they went with who the people wanted. And Thank God for that!"
awful the way the DNC treated Bernie
"What?  Why would the DNC do anything to help a guy who isnt even a member of the party, except when convenient vs a life long (completely corrupt) D, obedient 1st lady, senator, and SoS?"
"They shouldn’t. Just like they shouldn’t have helped Hillary. Let the voters choose, but the DNC can’t have that."
Not actively subverting the will of those who you are supposed to represent isn't necessarily helping Bernie
Yes. The Bernie to Trump supporter probably swung the election
I mean.. more people still voted for Hillary. It came down to the electoral college
"As a bernie to trump voter I can assure you there are many more like me. 
The electoral college is how our presidential elections work. Its not like it comes down to the popular vote. She fucked up and didnt campaign properly."
Would you vote for Bernie in a BvT? Just wondering
"It always comes down to the electoral college. No one runs for the popular vote. Hillary wasn’t trying to get it, Trump wasn’t trying to stop her from getting it. It’s meaningless except for sour grapes."
"It's funny because over to the other side, the people voting Democrat say Bernie is the only who can beat Trump."
"Well that's the glory of groups who value different things. Bernie Sanders is just about as far left as it gets as far as the US is concerned, so if you're in the left camp he's gonna look like the perfect candidate, the one offering everyone everything they want, the perfect shoo-in to take down the incumbent. But over here on the right, he seems like the guy who will fuck everything up, the guy that looks at what everyone wants and does the exact opposite, the guy most people would never be dumb enough to vote for."
"The difference, though, is that republicans are realist enough to recognize that Bernie Sanders is too extreme to avoid scaring off moderates, whereas the democrats are telling each other something to the effect of ""if we believe hard enough, all of our wishes will come true"""
Because who doesn’t love paying deductibles on their health insurance? There are millions and millions of Americans who can’t afford their medicine or a doctor visit. Homelessness rose by 3%... it’s already fucked up for many of us who don’t live on wall street.
Now instead of paying deductibles you can pay for your healthcare and your slacker neighbors too!
"When you pay your health insurance premium that goes towards other peoples' care too you know, right?"
Other people that are definitely contributing as well. A government run system would include the nearly half of America that doesn't pay net federal income tax.

Are you a republican?
"Yea, but I’m all in on Sanders. I was a never-Trumper who registered Democrat to vote for Bernie in the primary once I saw Trump was the nominee. I voted for Sanders in the general too since I hate Clinton and Trump. I hate PC culture, I’m not a socialist but I like some of the important social programs, and I learn libertarian with moral law. Sanders may diverge on many points with me, but he puts Americans first and I think he’s honest. I know what I’m getting."
Holy Bernie brigade!
"Lol, you think that’s bad, just wait until it’s an election."
Never take that for granted though. No one thought Trump could ever beat Hillary.
"I can't see Bernie getting the nod. I have a feeling it will either be Biden or Warren. Trump would mop the floor with Bernie. Not to mention Obama has said Bernie is not a Democrat and that he would discourage voters from voting his way if it came to it. It also doesn't look good that he refuses to endorse his own former VP. Either way, Im voting Trump in 2020."
Bernie would absolutely tank the economy so Wall Street would get behind Trump. Trump will easily beat him. 
"Bernie is a self admitted socialist, and that should be terrifying for Americans to hear. This man touted Venezuela as a great model before the inevitable happened there. Hell, he honeymooned in the USSR. Bernie is socialist scum deceiving easily tricked naive college students."
"America stands for freedom and liberty, not socialism. And we have people here that immigrated legally to get away and escape from socialism, they know what it's like to live under socialism. It kills people, hurts their country. Bernie can go to another country if he wants socialism."
Beautifully said!
"Thanks, it's the truth. Even though I'm a young college student, 20yrs old and i know what socialism is. Trump is the best person we have against these Democratic nutcases that are running for president."
"Can you please educate me on corporate socialism in the US. And how the richest country in then world allows 500k a year to go bankrupt because of medical debt. A family of four could have health premiums of $20,000 with high deductibles and copays."
"No, he cant because he wasn't taught how to dance around that properly yet. He's still young though so don't worry. At least he knows how to idolize correctly."
"You realize that they also escaped from dictators also, right?"
Socialism leads to totalitarianism every time. Name one socialist country that didn’t end up a dictatorship.
Norway
Is a capitalist country. What about it?
"Bernie is only trying to replicate the governance model of places like Norway, which you classify as capitalist. Therefore Bernie is proposing capitalist policies, by your logic, and so its obvious that his policies will not lead ""to totalitarianism every time."""
I wonder if there are any major variables that are different between Norway and the US?
Yes i do. Some bad ones i should add.

You clearly have no idea what a socialist is. 
"I would argue the Democrats are using fear to try and sway people. It’s all gloom and doom, yet America is doing quite well and the economy is up."
"Neither do you, apparently lol"
"Both parties do. Fear gets people engaged. If you tell them to be afraid of socialism, they'll fear socialism without a second thought. Dems do the same with guns."
You just have to show people the history of socialism and they are rightfully scared of it.
"Yes, Western Europe and Scandinavia are burning as we speak /s"
"Who is doing well? And what sector of the economy is up? Who is benefiting from all these changes? Who is ""America""? Cause I'll tell you that doesn't represent what's really going on in the country, and where it's going. Ask any economist how long things will sustain this way. The richest 400 families paid less tax than middle class people. 100 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in Federal tax. Stop agreeing with what these people are saying so you can feel like a part of a club that doesn't give a shit about you. Do your own research. Think for yourself."
"I think it’s important to point out that what he wants to copy is the economy of the Scandinavian countries, who has proven themselves able to succeed."
"Both my parents are from Denmark, so trust me when I say this. It is a fantastic model! BUT only for small homogenous societies. It works in Denmark because we are the size of a small US state and generally agree on everything. "
"Something like that would never work in the United States. We are much to diverse. Someone in farmland Texas has vastly different opinions, and life goals than someone living in the middle of NYC."
"I’ve heard these arguments before but I don’t see much merit to them. A good system works regardless of whether you scale it up or down and if the system does work, diversity and opinion just boils down to how people feel about it, not whether it actually works better or not."
A nanny state is not something to be proud of. You socialists should try spread your propaganda elsewhere. The welfare state works in countries with little immigration and a homogeneous population that doesn’t value lazy fucks. Too much dead weight in this country for that.
"Oh no, I don’t subscribe to the idea of a socialist government. Just some more sensical social programs and removal or restructuring of some existing ones. The Veterans Association for an example is an embarrassment. There’s always going to be mooches and scammers but there are also a lot of people who just need help getting back up."
A healthy and well educated society has a direct correlation with growth and prosperity. 
You do make a good point about immigration. Population numbers in an unpredictable flux could wreak havoc on a system that requires reasonable predictably.
Amen. So few understand what you just said.
"The genesis of Scandinavian societies rests on the reliability of their institutions. The people trust, because of the past record of the government and strong oversight, that their tax dollars aren't going into a dump. This stretches back over institutional integrity built over hundreds of years in a society that is far more collectivist than USA owing to their circumstances. The Scandinavian model is heavily based on trust, and that needs to be inculcated for its acceptance instead of being forced down the people's throats as they see a bloated, abusive, inefficient state asking for more money."
"Also, the middle class is heavily taxed in Scandinavia. The peak marginal personal income tax rates in Scandinavia start applying from below 2x the average wage. As a matter of fact, this is after Sweden's welfare splurge bankrupted them in the 80s and they cut back. At the same time, VAT taxes are around 25% and wage taxes which are employer paid and thus don't show up on the wage bills is above 30% even for the lowest wages. Their very few exemptions regime stops businesses from lobbying their brains out for cuts."
"This is however coupled with zero and ultra low corporate taxes and a reliable social safety net that people don't mind paying for because it works. The US's social spending practices border between shady and farcical. Instead of fixing that, throwing more money at it to wish away the problem is like the equivalent of the F-35 program if that was the entire economy."
"Oh and also, the Scandinavian economies are heavily globalised, foster startup culture and are fast leapfrogging towards a knowledge based economy, and their capital taxes have progressively been reduced. Their provision of public goods is both efficient as well as future facing (Scandinavian countries were the first to have a public system of internet fiber, they're reaping the benefits of it through private enterprise today, for example)."
"The way Bernie is going about seems to be more on the path of France, where taxes increase as the social sector fails and is held hostage to partisan bickering, instead of Scandinavia."
"Tl;dr: The state has to prove it'll be efficient and judicious with the money before asking for more à la Scandinavia. So far, no indications of the same."
"You post a lot in the AOC subreddit, Elizabeth Warren, and Chomsky for a “constitutional conservative.” GTFOH"
"I have one comment posted on each sub, and you think that’s a lot? But I have a long history of actively posting here and you just ignore that. You GTFOH with your lies. "
My comment on AOC was about gun control.
"“u /TeamAOC - the campaign claims to be a member of the Democratic Socialist movement, and Representative Cortez herself claims to be a socialist. In keeping with this, what is her stance on gun control? One of the tenants of socialism, especially one of socialist ideology that defines itself as being by and for the people.”"
Trump and Hillary ran on essentially the opposite economic platform but Wall Street still supported Hillary.
Hillary was no where near as far left as Bernie or even Warren on economic policies. Even I think Hillary (who I despise) would do a better job with the economy than socialist Bernie.
"Oh believe me I agree with that but that election was also so divisive that they practically ran while disagreeing on almost everything. The entire media was saying Trump would destroy the economy and they had all of those “expert economists” that agreed with that conclusion. The same people on top running the media and the ones who makes those big decisions in Wall Street who supported Hillary, never went pro Trump"
Young people and most people who are lazy want him to win. They here free... free.... free... and they jump all over it. They don’t understand free isn’t free. Someone in the end is paying for it all..
We pay in taxes. No one on the left is confused by that. No one hears free. They hear accessibility for all. A sacrifice WE ALL have to make so that the many less fortunate can also get the care they need. On top of everything a middleman pointlessly pocketing millions isn't efficient. 
"Also, is someone working 50 hours a week to barely scrape by lazy? And is the Kardashian family that makes a million dollars on one instagram post just a WAY HARDER worker than the 50 hours a week guy? "
I'm trying to understand but I just don't get it. A police department is a socialist institution. A fire station is a socialist institution. Dividing capitalism and socialism to appropriate situations. Car manufacturing? Capitalism to promote competition and growth. Police station? Socialism to promote fair and equal care to every citizen in need.
Edit: I also find it's important to understand the difference between socialism and social democracy. At least be fair in the characterization. No one wants a socialist country. We just need MORE socialism in very specific situations. For instance healthcare. Example of what we don't want being touched by socialism: electronic manufacturing. See what I mean?
half the country doesn't even pay net federal income tax. to those people it is free shit.
The homelessness rate rose by 3% under this administration — how the fuck does that qualify as the “best economy ever”?
"Bernie believes in workplace democracy. That means every manager gets a vote and every employee gets a vote. He wants all decision on how to run the day to day affairs of a company held to a vote. Think of it. You own a restaurant. You hire a cook and a waitress. Now your are out numbered 2 to 1. So those two employees propose and pass any company decision they want. For example, they can give themselves a pay raise and the owner has to come up with the money."
"If that law passes, every company that can move will move. No manager will lose the right to manage their company. That leaves location sensitive companies like restaurants and hotel having to deal with this law. They will go out of business. Employees don't have any skin in the game so employees will vote themselves pay raises, longer vacations, bonuses and shorter work hours. If the company goes out of business so what. It's not their business."
Economic collapse does not even begin to describe what will if Bernie is elected.
"Can you please source where you heard that “every manager gets a vote and every employee gets a vote”? Or that he “wants all decisions on how to run the day to day affairs of a company held to a vote”? As I understand it, Bernie’s plan to restore workplace democracy takes several actions to give employees more power - mainly establishing federal protections for unions in various ways - but does not just give them all as much say as a manager, much less the owner of a business as you stated with the restaurant example. Never heard anything about votes. Employees can’t just pass any company decision they want under Bernie’s plan. And Bernie also plans to deny federal contracts to companies that outsource overseas. Am I missing something? Genuinely curious"
Can you please source &lt;&lt;
You have a keyboard don't you. It's all over the internet. Google it.
"I searched several things you said and couldn’t find anything backing it up. Maybe my search engine is biased because it knows I’m liberal, that’s why I’m asking you. Don’t you think the burden of proof should be on the person making the claim instead of expecting every other person who reads your comment to verify it for themselves? It’s your responsibility to back yourself up, not mine. I tried, though, so now I’m asking."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HClEOrbwVHM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HClEOrbwVHM</a>"
"Nowhere in that video does he say ""every manager gets a vote and every employee gets a vote"" or that he wants ""all decisions on how to run the day to day affairs of a company held to a vote"". Thats a huge stretch in my opinion. He said that he wants workers to have ""some"" say in the work that they are doing and how the company they work for functions. I agree with that. There needs to be a balance, and right now that balance is way out of wack, giving employers too much power. If you think the lives of many should be totally determined by the few that employ, we have a fundamental philosophical difference."
Did you see the video. I am seriously. He said that he is for workplace democracy. What part of democracy in the workplace don’t you understand. Then he followed with there would be no outsourcing with workplace democracy. So he is saying that in a democratically run workplace the workers will have veto power over management.
"Yep, I watched the whole thing. He said he’s for workplace democracy. “Democracy” doesn’t mean everyone has the same amount of power over all decisions. In the US, does each citizen get a vote on every decision? No. We get to vote on certain local decisions, and to vote for those who we think will make the decisions that align with our values. In our democracy, mayors, representatives, senators, and presidents, etc. all have different levels of power over major decisions. He’s saying that under workplace democracy, less companies will outsource overseas because the workers will actually have some say. He never implied that workers will have veto power, just that they will be given some say, which is desperately needed seeing how employers abuse employees in the system we have now, where employees have very few protections if they want to do so much as ask for a decent wage."
"He’s saying that under workplace democracy, less companies will outsource overseas because the workers will actually have some say. &lt;&lt; "
"Which only proves my point. Workers will have ""some say"".  If management need to outsource but it doesn't happen because workers have ""some say"" that means the workers are in change."
"I disagree. I think Sanders will be trouble for Trump bec he speaks the same language of appeasing workers and bringing back jobs. Also, single payer healthcare is popular with both sides of the aisle."
Those people are already Trump voters and likely already have jobs thanks to Trump’s economy.
There are many more like them and where they came from who are still waiting.
[removed]
He will increase taxes beyond anyone's ability to pay them with all of his free giveaways.
Socialism has been tried and has failed. Bernie Never-held-an-actual-job-in-his-life Sanders has no clue how economics works
Let’s take tax rates back to the Reagan years. People always seem to forget that these absurdly low tax rates(particularly for high earners) are a very recent invention.
"If you review his plans, many of them will decrease taxes for working Americans."
He's also worked as a carpenter and a teacher before being elected as an independent.
"If you review his plans, many of them will decrease taxes for working Americans."
Then who will pay them?
I think he means SOME taxes will be reduced while others will go up massively. Overall everyone will end up paying much much more in taxes if this socialist fool is elected.
"He is a working class man himself, now a millionaire. He's not against people making it rich....he just wants those who have money to spare to not use it to bribe government officials, but to give it to the government fairly for planned development"
“give it to the government fairly”
Haha haha. That is such a roundabout way of saying the government is going to take your hard earned money. Fucking socialists man.
He literally said they shouldn’t exist.
Bernie never worked an honest day in his life. He’s a career politician who payed someone to write a book for him to sell to  his low IQ supporters.
MOST taxes will be reduced.
SOME will go up massively.
"If you're going to say what i meant, say it correctly."
But overall everyone pays more?
"Honestly, just listen to the guy for 5 minutes and he'll start going on about billions wasted in corporate bailouts, prisons, and a broken healthcare system. Lol"
"We already can pay for it, we just don't because we send our money to everyone else first in wars and bailouts for big businesses so they can continue tanking small businesses."
He talks about saving billions through corporate tax hikes but then talks about spending trillions. His math never adds up to anything except crushing debt. We would have to tax everyone earning over 100k a year nearly 99% of their income to pay for what he is asking for.
Where'd you get that math from? Lol
"<a href=""https://www.city-journal.org/bernie-sanders-expensive-spending-proposals"">https://www.city-journal.org/bernie-sanders-expensive-spending-proposals</a>"
Their figures + current income wealth distribution charts.
That doesn't add up once you factor the cuts to an inflated military budget and reduced healthcare costs. I'm at work but that website didn't present all the information equally. 
"Millionaires would be concerned about that much in taxes but with the average American income at less than $50,000, it's a pure win for most of the population and a mixed bag for top earners."
I'm no socialist but I appreciate honest math when American lives are at risk.
"You don't seem to see though that reducing our military spending will put not just american lives at risk, but Europeans, middle eastern, and then American lives at risk again when more instability befalls those regions."
"By the way, taking money from people just so that others win is called theft."
"Bernie is a dangerous lunatic who is mentally stuck as a sophomore in college. His presidency would crash the US economy which would trigger a world-wide depression which would start World War III. The Democrats insane shift leftward, it it's not stopped by Americans, will cost billions of lives."
They said the same thing about trump and none of that happened. 
Excuse me for not believing the Reactionary Hysteria.
He did just have a heart attack and is ridiculously old. If anything that should sway you.
Pick your favorite old man over 70 and vote lol
"I know, we need some youth in politics bad. By youth I mean 40-50 year range lol"
"Taxation and theft is what socialism is. Bernie is an evil socialist scumbag. Capitalism any day of the week over socialism. I always ask people who are for socialism, where has it ever worked and succeeded. And the free-medicare-for-all, i know i wouldn't want to be living on a Gov't healthcare plan, that'd be a nightmare, and free college for everyone. Who's gonna pay for that, our coutry is already trillions of dollars in debt."
[removed]
And no mention of how much you pay in taxes.
"Personal,income tax rate in Denmark - 56% (plus 8% more as a social security tax)"
Sales tax rate in Denmark   - 25%
"<a href=""https://tradingeconomics.com/denmark/personal-income-tax-rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tradingeconomics.com/denmark/personal-income-tax-rate</a>"
And who provides your military protection? :) 
It's easy to pay for stuff when someone else is covering your defense.
"Pretty much all of the happiest countries in the world could be described as socialist: <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/finland-is-the-world-s-happiest-country-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/finland-is-the-world-s-happiest-country-again/</a>"
I would also wonder what your definition of socialism is? At what point does a country become socialist? Do you consider Medicare socialism? How about social security? Unemployment benefits? Social services?
"Yeah, communist countries were happy at first, too. Germany was happy at first as well."
"Socialism is increasing our taxes, and stealing from companies putting them out of business. And it depends on what kind of medicare someone wants, i prefer a private healthcare instead of a Gov't one. So that you're only paying for yours and no one else's. Social security i can't comment on yet, mainly because i don't know enough about it yet. Unemployment is at a record low for everyone, not worried about that, until someone takes away jobs from us. Like Obama did when he was president. And could you tell what kind of social services you're talking about?"
So that you're only paying for yours and no one else's. 
"When you pay your health insurance premium that goes towards other peoples' care you know, right?"
"He’s doing things that are different. And I agree with a lot, but giving free things out is not the answer and people need to understand nothing is free! This is America, hard work pays off."
"People with big money dont want Bernard to tank the economy, so big money would silently push President Trump (even if they dont want him overall) because they vote with their brains and wallets."
"Imagine telling a bunch of very rich and powerful people who either directly or by proxy employee millions that they will make a lot less money forever until the Socialism BS is out in total. ""hey, give up your money"" is a great selling point? LOL"
"I respectfully disagree with the title.  It should be replaced with ""If Democrats nominate anyone , they hand the election to Trump""."
Very naive
"I don’t know, the Democrat Elites can’t win the working man, and Bernie has proven he can in places like West Virginia. Maybe he can’t beat Trump, but at the same time maybe he’d come closer than another Dem Elitist."
I’m afraid Sanders is the most formidable. Vermont is a fairly conservative state and he has won there for decades.
That would also make AOC the leader of the Democratic party. l doubt Pelosi and Schumer will let it happen.
"Tbf if they nominate Biden, they do the same"
"Biden has a chance because moderate liberals will vote for him, and they vastly outnumber the leftists that would vote bernie"
"Idk, I think people know what they'll get with Trump, and won't take a chance on a corrupt, career politician pedo"
I think Biden is the only serious candidate. The rest of the communists are just to far to the left.
"If you happen to see my F150 and it has a Trump sticker and a Bernie Sanders sticker, now you know why."
Bernie is 5 bridges too far
"If they nominate Bernie, Biden or Warren, they hand the election to Trump. All three candidates are unelectable."
"If any Democrat faces Trump it's an easy Trump landslide. Biden is corrupt and senile. Talking about kids rubbing his hairy legs at the pool. Warren is full of crap, lying about everything, and pandering to everybody. Buttigieg is a young kid that can't run South Bend let alone the country."
Trump’s winning regardless of Democrat at this point.
"If they nominate Biden, Trump wins easily. Sanders though I think might have a fighting chance."
Agreed
Don't know about that. I'd vote for Bernie over Trump.
Why then? Why do you support socialism?
If only his policies were socialist....
You're joking right?
Welcome to reddit
Bernie wants to replicate the Scandinavian welfare model. Do you honestly consider Scandinavian countries socialist?
"When did he say this? I'm say socialism is bad in general, it's full of Gov't control, corruption, and coercion."
And I agree with that. And Bernie is not proposing socialism.
"He's a socialist man, of course that's what he's proposing. But people want to ignore that though."
Bernie wants to replicate the Scandinavian welfare model. Do you honestly consider Scandinavian countries socialist?
"I don't know much about Scandinavia, I'll be honest about that. Could you enlighten me on their socialism, and why it's a good thing."
"Quit giving the class away for free, Professor."
I honestly believe the only person who can beat Trump is Michelle and even that will be a close one. Even then..VOTE
If Bernie is nominated trump is in big trouble imo. Anyone else and he easily wins
"As a conservative, please elect Bernie."
"Hang on, let me quit my job first"
Bernie will destroy Trump if Trump doesn't destroy himself first.
Bernie is the only one who recognizes the dangers of climate change. Elect anyone else and New York will probably go underwater within 20 years. Gives a whole new meaning to Wall Street is sinking
New York will probably go underwater within 20 years
You promise?
Lmao
There’s only one logical thing to do then! Republican Party should back Bernie to ensure Trump’s success!
It’s going to be Bloomberg vs Trump
"If they nominate anyone other than Joe Biden, they had it to Trump"

I'm all for it. The city of Chicago hates the Police there; let them just stop going to work. 
"When everybody dies, we won't have to listen to their bullshit anymore"
"They will blame us somehow. ""that one single republican amongst hundreds of democrats voted on this, IMPEACH!!!!"""
Kanye is the only Republican in Chicago.
Correct
I’m a republican in Chicago

The Purge just got a new sequel
"if they’re getting their home broken in to, their primary option is the abolished police. I suppose if there’s no police dems could use their guns to defend themselves... oh wait hahaha"
"Wow, this is the most fantasy land platform I’ve ever seen."
I say privatize the police. Stop forcing citizens to pay for public servant salaries; let the citizens voluntarily pay. You would see an increase in support real quick for the second amendment.
"No, history has tried that, over, and over again.  Policing is one of the most basic and worthwhile functions of government.  If it were privatized, we'd be a hop, skip, and a jump away from warlords. "
"Just imagine with me:  Wealthy Suburbanville hires ACME Paramilitary Kick Ass Private Police LLC, and being private, police corruption would go from yes it exists (today), to their central and paramount function.  Remember it's a private entity with guns, and helicopters, and jails.  As ACME Paramilitary Kick Ass Police grows, and is hired by more and more wealthy communities, and gets their hands into more coffers...   They become unstoppable.  "
<strong>They become the new government</strong>...
"Not at all. Private policing has existed for centuries. It would do just as it does now: you don't pay, you done get protected. Groups can pay for group protection; entire blocks or gated communities pay for their own force"
"Essentially, you get city-states; those with money pay their police to shake you down; maybe invade you if you can't protect yourself. None takes over entirely because someone else's force can afford it's own freedom. Why don't the cops overthrow their rich bosses? Because then they don't get paid."
I've thought about this before and the only roadblock I Couldnt get past was where do they draw the line on helping someone.  Would it work like an HOA or?  Not sarcastic at all totally serious question.
"Abolish the police? Then only people with money who can afford to hire private security will get safety. Middle class and rich neighborhoods will hire private security to patrol their homes and streets. The poor will not be able to afford to hire private security. Also, because there is such tight gun control laws in blue states, these poor neighborhoods  will have no guns to protect themselves. The result is lawless neighborhoods in poor sections of town. Gang banners and drug dealers will rule their poor areas. "
But I would love to see Democrats run on getting rid of the police.
I always wanted to see what true anarchy looked like!
*bangers

As someone who works in law enforcement... please.  <strong>PLEASE!</strong>  Do this!  Do these idiots have any idea how happy I would be to be able to just sit my ass at home and watch them all fall to pieces the moment they have to deal with their own problems?  I'd cash in fifty grand of my retirement to buy all the beer and popcorn I could stack in my garage and invest in a really comfortable lawn chair.  I'm dying to see this shit show.
"These people have no idea what police work actually entails.  They probably think it's all about running up to suspicious looking minorities and grilling them about where they are from and where they are going and looking for reasons to search or detain them.  And maybe that's the sort of thing they are aiming to end.  But, what they don't ever seem to realize is what most of an officer's day is actually made up of.  It's not looking for potheads or vagrants or burglarly/robbery suspects.  Most of the time it's just dealing with inept human being that can't handle their own lives."
"We joke when at the 911 call center that the call takers should answer the phone saying, ""911, where is your emergency, and what part of real life can you just not cope with today?"""
"And that's precisely what the problem is.  Police are now the catch all for every tiny problem going on in people's lives.  Depressed about your job?  Don't go pay a counselor to help you.  Don't go admit yourself into a mental health treatment facility.  No.  Just call 911 and tell the dispatcher you're depressed.  Then they'll have to send a police officer to come ""talk you off the ledge"" so to speak, even though that officer may not have any kind of a degree or any formal education or training in handling mental health issues whatsoever.  You could quite literally just get some cop that stares at you and say, ""Well, uh... gee, that sucks, man.  Best of luck to you!"""
"What about people who call 911 because they saw a car drive down the street that they don't recognize?  Or those that call because they saw an adult scold a child too harshly in the grocery store?  Or how about the ones that call because the power went out in their neighborhood?  Like, what the fuck does a police officer have to do with your electricity?!  What about the person who calls because they saw a stray cat and don't want it to get cold?  "
"These sorts of calls make up 90% of what goes into the call center.  And some agencies <strong>require</strong> every request for an officer have an officer dispatched.  So, do you think I'd be heartbroken if police were abolished?  Hell no!  I'm <strong>dying</strong> to see how people handle their day to day lives with police to hold their hands and pat their heads every time they ""just can't cope.""  Nothing would please me more than to tell someone asking me for help with something stupid, ""Uh, no.  That's your problem.  Handle your shit, and get off my lawn."""
"In all seriousness, this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, and that's really saying something given how much time I've watched AOC on the news."
"Democrats support this about as much as Republicans support Hitler, dont believe things you see on reddit."
"Yanno, I say let them all move to a single place, have all the utopian society you want.  Vote yes on every aoc inspired bill and get rid of any borders etc. "
"California seems like a good place for that.  President Trump, please just wall off the south and California.  Kick CA out of the union and let them rot in their own leftist sludge. "
Within 10 years we will have a western border problem. 
"OH yeah, make sure to train all those tough muscular gritty antifa members for your military as they are the true revolutionaries.  Put the non binary people in charge of something and last but no least make sure everything is fair and evenly split right down the middle for everyone. "
"Sorry for the rant but none of the people who suggest any of this crap will ever have to live amongst the people they push it on.  When I see Pelosi living on the streets of San Fran and putting her high heels in human feces,  then damn it I'm a fannnn!!!!"
Sounds good to me. Let them see how “great” it is without police.
Not a new idea and yeah it’s stupid.
"This is exactly what hardcore Leftists want. Create anarchy, destruction, make crime skyrocket and destroy the foundation of society so that once all of us are dead, nothing is left but immigrants who know no better, then the pricks at the top will replace our Constitution with a Communist manifesto. That's when the takeover will be complete."

Who we gonna fight tho? The empire?
"From a militaristic viewpoint, the purpose would primarily be to develop anti-satellite technology and missile defense options.  Orbital technology, be it satellites or manned spacecraft, would be used to shut down satellite surveillance and communications operated by enemies, and those craft would also have better line of sight to apply missile defense systems since ballistic missiles would have their highest heat signature rising up through the atmosphere.  They could be destroyed or spoofed shortly after launch and before the missile could pose a threat."
"I don’t know, but this is an attempt to get ahead of it.  Orbital zones are becoming commercialized and it’s going to be the wild west up there without some kind of policing.  Those vehemently against this probably have an “if you’re for it, I’m against it” attitude with anything Trump or anything coming from the team they don’t cheer for.  I’m sure that once upon a time people scoffed at the idea of an Air Force."

What’d it say might I ask?
"It was leftist trolling. They were unhappy with calling the meme an example of colluding. The term is actually besides the point. Not the best choice of words perhaps, but the actions of Obama here implies a promise of a future quid pro quo, which dismantles the left's problem with Trump."
Amazing this seems to be a revelation for some.   Completely dismissed by the US media.

Are you literally so young you can't remember this?
"This meeting needs to be deleted for the npc's, they can't compute ...."
"Yep. 
Obama. 
US history's worst president."
Andrew Johnson
"I think Andrew Jackson was the worst he denied orders from the Supreme Court and sent thousands of Indians to their death on the trail of tears, but sadly he’s in our family tree."
Obama did far worse things than Johnson ever did. He should have been removed from office within his first term. The above post is glaring evidence of this. The post was also not made up or faked. This did happen. All these liberals are pissed about a fake Russian collusion within the Trump administration when Obama actually colluded with them. It makes me sick how much of a blind eye has been turned for Obama based on his skin color. He should be in prison sitting next to the whole Clinton family for the treason he committed.
It’s not exactly due to his skin color.. dude was charismatic
"That's how he got elected not how he stayed president. It did help he has the gift of gab but you can't tell me that he stayed president because he was a smooth talker. His crimes were way out in the open during his second term. Specially towards the end of it. Could you imagine the outrage from the lefties if the first ever ""black"" president was removed from office? The cities would have fallen apart."
"Thing is wasn’t this talk during a time in which russia was being overly aggressive to the West with missile tests or whatever, so what Obama did was say that if Putin would stop,m the aggression/“give him space”, he would manage to ease the sanctions on Russia which were cause for the aggression in the first place. In my understanding Obama didn’t really benefit from this unlike trump where he would benefit in his next election. I don’t think what Obama did here was a crime exactly, but, what else did you think he did? As a crime that is."
"How about that BIG pallet of money given to the middle East for no reason, fast and furious gun running in Mexico, the nuclear deal with Iran OUR ENEMIES and known terrorists supporters to name a few. It doesn't take much searching to find an extensive list of scandals that happened under his watch. Also if Nixon resigned before impeachment because it was found people under him we're spying on his political opposition Obama did that 10 times over and nothing was said about it. Obama was one of the most crocked presidents this country has ever had."
Wow
Toy can be a conservative and not sell out people
Just asking but how do you get negative karma
Dunno
He did more than Obama. Hooray Hooray Hooray. Hes supposed to add to Obama successes and correct his mistakes.  That is his job. Stop acting like little men.
[removed]
Desperate? Obama sacrificed foreign policy to make it look like he had Russia under control. 
His actions with Iran is what took the cake. Unfreezing assets to a terrorist regime was his foreign policy. 
He was a garbage president. That man spoke well and knobed with Hollywood. That's and the millions of displaced Syrians because everyone knew he wouldn't do shit.
How is this desperate? This literally happened it was on a hot mic and everything
Buttttttttt!!!! Obama gonna pay my bills!!!
Keep dreaming folks while our current leader acts like a clown and you all know it. Stop this foolishness.  Trying to look back and all. What was done is done. Deal with the now and right now our country is in trouble and it's not the Dems..
"It is most definitely the dems...everything circles back to them. Last I checked, the ""clown"" has done more than Obama did in 8 years, in one term."
Here you go. He did more than Obama as if anyone has made Obama a god. You guys have issues with Obama that's you're beef not mine. I. Rooting for Donald John to be the best president he can be but he is nuts period. I'm not a Democrat.  So can the ish.
I hope so. Why would we hate anyone's successes.  He's supposed to do his fricking job and stop the bull. Yall look sick trying to compare him to Obama. Morally speaking in my opinion I wouldn't want him to visit my kids school and neither would you.
"Obama was the previous president... That's why the comparisons are made between the two but to dispell any kind of bait and switch you're trying with that statement, bush was a trainwreck in comparison to Trump when it comes to foreign policy and economic growth and Clinton wasn't much better than bush. Also, since we're on a moral high ground with your last statement, I'm fine with you not wanting him to visit your kids' school. That's your choice but I wouldn't assume or press my views as everyone else's view to try to create an emotional argument. Those debates will get nowhere."
"See, I know you think you sound intelligent but riddle me this. Is the point of bringing up past presidents working for you guys. I can see you winning that argument with someone who doesn't know any better but its childish. No bait and switch here guy. I just dont get you're point. Is he a good man or not. Simple question.  See because I think one must have some sort of moral compass to lead anyone. Dont you? Foreign policy my foot. What policy do you speak  of. Tell it to me. What is our posture  now."
"It’s both. Though I would prefer most Republicans to most Democrats, though I am anti Trump."
"Anti Trump or not, you can't downplay his accomplishments and how they have improved the country. You can hate someone all day long but I'm sure that you have some moral skeletons in your closet as well. The only difference between Trump and you is that he's in the face of the media and everything is attempted to be put out in the open. I personally like the fact that he's not a career politician and has done pretty much everything that he ran on. That being said, I lean more right than I will ever lean to the socialist left but that's because feelings don't matter one bit in business but we're going into a different topic on that."
Looking forward to when you lose the election based on your own party's attempt to circumvent the democratic process. 😉
Keep dreaming bud. If he wasn't an ass clown and a general nutjob maybe you guys can really compare him to someone else. Till then hows that wall coming that Mexico is paying for. Dont worry I'll wait
You are a loser who will lose again.
Thanks bud. Means a lot coming from you. Anyway you should hope he loses. Hes o ly gonna dig a deeper hole. Just saying. Dont get butthurt about it. It is what it is. Hell I may vote for his stupid ass just to gi e him enough rope.
Clowns always talking about the Dems. Shup. We all live in this fricking  country. Dems to. Just shut up.

"While I understand the author’s loyalty to the agency he served, I wonder what his explanation is that no a single individual from that agency has yet said anything to complain about what they did. The authority of the FISA Court has now been used for political abuse in such a magnitude that there is no way to assure the public that the same thing will not happen again. Had Trump not defeated Clinton every bit of this would never been known.  The only punishment the agencies will understand is if the whole FISA Court process is eliminated and anyone who touched this operation fired. They are either complicit or are to concerned with keeping their job than to do what duty and responsibility requires."

Lmao we all got downvoted on this shit by some liberal
You mean the guy we already know committed perjury in front of the House Intel Committee when he said that the Steele dossier played no role in the creation of intelligence community assessment on Russian interference when the facts prove beyond any doubt whatsoever that the opposite is true? 
"Yeah, IDGAF if people are upset by him being investigated. Those people should probably also be investigated if their morals suggest that he is the <em>good guy</em> here. He used foreign intelligence that he knew to be false, which the people who made it up personally told him were jokes and shouldn't be taken serious, to spy on an opposing side's political candidate. He's a criminal who should be in prison for violating about a dozen people's civil rights just for this one thing."
Never do I want to see people end up in jail unless you are nothing but evil. But for the past year we’ve had to hear how the Mueller investigation wasn’t a witch hunt as multiple people ended up in jail. It’s time they paid the same price as others.
Good
Those CIA veterans should also be investigated.  Their own actions are now called into question if they are openly expressing a desire for criminal behavior to not be looked into.  Makes me wonder just how many times <strong>they</strong> violated the law.

He's the one ripping it apart. Trump needs a smack upside the head with a cast iron skillet
"I disagree with this.  When the opposition keeps slapping your extended hand and shows their hatred constantly, are you really expected to keep extending that hand and offering peace?  There is a point where a sane person says that enough is enough, if you cannot work with me then why should I try to work with you?  The opposition needs to extend the olive branch and honestly quit trying to hold this country as a hostage until they get their way.  Trump isn't the one dividing this country."

Why would she fold? What can happen to her worse than the Senate finding Trump not guilty and perhaps spending several weeks pointing out the utter incompetence of her articles of impeachment?
"29 House Democratic seats lay in districts that Trump won. Most of them were won because of Decreased voter turnout in a non-Presidential election year, when Democrat anger was high and a lot of Republicans weren't happy with their party thwarting Trump's agenda, along with older voters raised on anti-Russian sentiment withholding judgement until after the Mueller report (which was withheld for a wild goose chase on obstruction issues until after the election)."
"It will be hard enough keeping the House majority as it is. With Republicans stirred up and angry, it's likely impossible. The sooner this goes away, the better it is for the Democratic party."
She'll fold because a trial in the senate will hold up all of the dems running for Prez instead of campaigning. Prob 6 weeks says Cruz. That puts the power back in the Republicans hands and she won't do that. Hopefully she never passes it onto the Senate and the whole impeachment is null.  What an FU to the corrupt house. Hahaha.
Corrupt Senate*
Nancy has no clue what she's doing. Shes holding on desperately to her dwindling career while she rolls over and let's the squad have their way with her caucus.
The only thing bipartisan was the opposition to Nancy’s impeachment sham.
[removed]
"Yup, and my point still stands. "
Bipartisan opposition against impeachment.
[removed]
"Actually, with Congress. "
"A couple of Democrats voted against impeachment. The media ignored it, but it’s on the record. "
"If even one Senator votes to remove GEOTUS, the media would call that overwhelming bi-partisan support."
"Republican here. Out of curiosity and because I haven't been able to find an answer elsewhere, if Pelosi continues to hold on to the Articles of Impeachment, is the Senate allowed to just go forward and acquit the President anyway? I mean, they already know the House impeached, that's already a matter of record, so why even require physical Articles at this point?"
"Depends on your view. However the best explanation I have heard is when the House held the vote and it passed, the Democrats, who are in control, declared President Trump was officially Impeached. Unless you want to add some stuff that ain’t there, it’s now a matter for the Senate. The defined authority of the House is complete. "
Now people argue that the House has not delivered/published/notified the Senate. But that requirement is not listed as the process. All that was needed was the official vote. Makes sense to me but everyone has an opinion.
"Probably. Nixon v. US 506--U.S. 224 (1993)(NOT to be confused with US. V. Nixon, which decided Richard M. Nixon had turn over whitehouse tapes) says that given the plenary power of the Senate to hold impeachment trials, they certainly can. Under that decision, it's impossible for the Senately to improperly try an impeachment and that judicial review of their constitutional power was simply not allowed."
"Republican here. Out of curiosity and because I haven't been able to find an answer elsewhere, if Pelosi continues to hold on to the Articles of Impeachment, is the Senate allowed to just go forward and acquit the President anyway?"
"Yes, they can.  The articles are an official resolution passed by the House, and as such they are a public record.  The Senate, if they wanted to, could just pull them from the House's website and take them up.  It's really more tradition to wait for legislation to be delivered to the Senate.  It's not a requirement.  But, it's advantageous for Republicans to let Pelosi play her little game because it weakens the impeachment case.  It undercuts the Democrats' argument that they couldn't settle the executive privilege dispute in court because they didn't have time.  The longer they hold the impeachment articles, they more they discredit that entire argument."
I think the SCOTUS case you're looking for is Nixon v USA c1993.
Interesting. I would like to know more about how this works. Can you point me in the right direction?
"Sure.  The impeachment resolution and its status are recorded and published on the government's website.  You can print the resolution yourself.  It's available in PDF form <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%2520of%2520Impeachment.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNxumf6dXmAhUJGs0KHTfmBY4QFjALegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw15NAGUCmiFdD1tIOgrOLt5"" rel=""nofollow"">here.</a>  Also, you can read the resolution and see its status <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/755/text"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and you can even see the vote totals <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/755/all-actions?overview=closed&amp;q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22%3A%22all%22%7D"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>."
"So, the Senate literally has everything it needs to take up the bill.  The articles have been written, approved, voted on, passed, and published.  And Congress's own website has all of that.  So the Senate can take it up any time it wants."
It's really more tradition to wait for legislation to be delivered to the Senate. It's not a requirement.
"No, this part. Can you point to further reading on this part?"
"Ah, yes.  The above poster actually linked the court case which established that the Senate has broad discretion on how it handles impeachment trials.  "
"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States</a>"
I'll give you the relevant parts of the decision...
"The court's decision was unanimous, but four separate opinions were published. <strong>The majority opinion, by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, held that the courts may not review the impeachment and trial of a federal officer because the Constitution reserves that function to a coordinate political branch.</strong> Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution gives the Senate the ""sole power to try all impeachments."" <strong>Because of the word sole it is clear that the judicial branch was not to be included.</strong> Furthermore, because the word try was originally understood to include factfinding committees, <strong>there was a textually demonstrable commitment to give broad discretion to the Senate in impeachments.</strong>"
"Furthermore the Framers believed that representatives of the people should try impeachments, and the Court was too small to justly try impeachments. Also, the judicial branch is ""checked"" by impeachments, so <strong>judicial involvement in impeachments might violate the doctrine of the separation of powers.</strong>"
"So, the essence of this ruling is that the Senate determines on its own how it handles a trial.  It is not bound by any arbitrary rule that articles of impeachment be hand delivered.  And however the Senate decides to handle the impeachment, it can't be reviewed by the courts because the court's decision says that allowing the courts to review impeachment when they are in fact checked by impeachment themselves would violate the separation of powers.  "
"So, however the Senate decides to handle this, even the Supreme Court can't overrule them.  The Senate has the power to impeach Supreme Court justices, so justices are obviously not allowed to be involved in deciding the impeachment process.  And the Constitution gives the Senate the ""sole"" power of trying impeachments.  The House doesn't get to decide how it's done, and the courts cannot question it."
"Now, if you are wanting to read about a specific requirement that bills be hand delivered to the Senate, I can't link you anything on that because no such requirement exists.  That's really what is at issue here.  There is no law or rule that sets any such terms.  It has just been the way we've always done things.  There is a 75 foot (yes, literally 75 feet) distance between where the bill sits in the House and the Senate.  So, obviously any requirement that it be hand delivered would be laughably arbitrary."
"Thank you. I mean, it's not laughably arbitrary as it's exactly what's happening. But I get your point kind of."
"But but, wasn't the impeachment so urgent that they couldn't bother with due process ?"
"Oooh yeah, cuz it's al a fake theater to try smear Trump's reputation."
"I love this, I've heard of one power trying to violate the division of powers before."
"But I never heard of HALF one of the powers trying to violate the division of powers, and it's own faculties by demanding the Executive, the Judicial, and half of the legislative to do their bidding."
This is the biggest tantrum in modern history lol. how can ANYONE vote for the democrats and Nancy after this is beyond ridiculous.
"I've been saying this from the day I heard she was holding the articles hostage to dictate the senate procedure. She has no leverage, she's calling their bluff and she's the only one bluffing, and everybody knows it, it is plain as day. The majority in the senate would be absolutely delighted to never receive the articles, if it were up to them the articles wouldn't even exist. If she hangs on to them it's business as usual, if she sends them tomorrow it's over in a few weeks. "
"Meanwhile 5 (was 6) senators are running for president, only two of those senators have any shot whatsoever, they're tied up for the first two primary elections. You want to see another rebellion of Democrats like 2016 with Bernie bros? Have the Democratic party tie up Sanders and Warren and hamstring their campaigns. I promise you their supporters don't show up to vote for Biden."
"Trump could use this for his campain, to say that the impeachemnt was partisan, pointing out the leftist incompetence."

Do any of you guys actually deny that trump didn’t block congress from doing their rightful duty?
"Yes, we can deny that because it didn't happen at all."
Congress and the White House are equal bodies so that is an impeachable offense technically.
"No, them being equal bodies mean it is <strong>not</strong> an impeachable offense.  When two branches of government are at an impasse, the third litigates the dispute.  That means that if the president (executive branch) and Congress (legislative branch) can't agree on whether or not executive privilege applies to a request for documents or witnesses, the court (judicial branch) hears the dispute and makes a decision.  The Democrats in the House, though, refused to let the judicial branch get involved.  Trump asked for the case to go to court.  Congress refused.  Trump never obstructed Congress.  Congress obstructed itself.  It had a legal means to settle the issue and declined to do so.  And in doing so they attempt to criminalize the act of appealing a issue to the courts."
[removed]
"False,"
Nope.  No matter how much you want it to be.
the democrats were willing to have a fair trial but trump wouldn’t let witnesses come forth
Trump has a legal right to several kinds of privilege when it comes to producing witnesses and documents.  These privileges have existed since the country was founded.  Don't like it?  Too bad.  
How can you block 2 major witnesses and then ask for a trial?
"You apparently don't know how trials work.  This happens every single day in courts all over the country.  Prosecution or defense attorneys object to a witness or a piece of evidence.  A judge then makes a decision as to whether or not it is admissible.  And if he says it's not, then it's not allowed.  That's the process that happened here, except the Democrats decided not to let a judge make that decision.  Well, it doesn't work that way."
You can’t ask for a trial and then block any and all evidence.
"Yes, you can if you're entitled to an established legal privilege over the evidence in question... which the president is. "
This argument could go in forever but bottom line is trump was not only obstructing valuable evidence from reaching the right hands he was also obstructing a thorough investigation.
"No.  Executing your rights is not and never will be obstruction.  If there's a dispute between two branches over privilege, the courts are to settle the dispute."
"Congress and the president are <strong>co-equal.</strong>  Congress does not have the power to make demands of the executive branch and just expect full compliance.  That's why we have separation of powers.  And president can't make demands of Congress.  If he does, do you think the president could just overthrow Congress for obstruction?  Obviously, not.  That's what co-equal means.  No branch has absolute power over another."
[removed]
Simply put if he himself believed he was innocent he would comply.
Nope.  And don't try telling that to every innocent person who ever objected to a piece of evidence or testimony in court.  
Yes congress and the executive are co-equal but we have a system of checks and balances you seem to forget.
"Nope.  I remember those checks and balances, and I laid them out quite clearly.  You simply wish they didn't exist."
When Nixon was in the impeachment process he complied
"You now obviously don't have the first fucking clue what you are talking about.  Not one clue.  Nixon did <strong>not</strong> comply.  He asserted privilege.  He resigned <strong>after</strong> a judge heard a legal challenge to the privilege and it was defeated.  That's when he realized that the evidence was going to come out that proved his guilt, and then he resigned.  You don't know your history, and I can only assume that is why you believe the false narrative you're pushing."
Clinton was in the impeachment process he complied.
"Umm... Clinton didn't have anything to comply with.  Again, you don't know your history.  Clinton's impeachment didn't even require Congress to do an investigation.  He was impeached for crimes he committed in a completely different legal matter in the lower courts.  He was in a televised court hearing under oath and committed perjury and was found to be involved in witness tampering.  His impeachment articles were based on publicly available evidence, a particularly easy thing to do given his primary felony charge was done on national television.  So, Clinton did not ""comply"" with anything.  The House basically said, ""Hey, the president committed perjury on live television.  We're impeaching him.""  And then the Senate said, ""Well, okay.  Make your case.""  So, no, there was no need for Clinton's compliance.  He didn't have a chance to assert executive privilege because the evidence was his own lie told under oath on television.  You don't need to subpoena the president for a live TV recording."
Hard to see how a so called innocent man wouldn’t just simply comply to clear his name
"Let me just accuse you of the worst crimes imaginable.  If you don't allow me to upend your life, you're guilty.  That's ludicrous and wholly un-American thinking you have.  "
"if trump wanted to end it he would’ve complied, but now the court of public opinion has spoken."
"And the public has decided it doesn't support this impeachment.  The latest poll was 47% not in favor of removal and 45% for it.  And public opinion doesn't matter on the question of whether or not the president is actually guilty of a crime.  If the public's opinion decided guilt, OJ Simpson would be in prison for murder.  He's not."
"The branches are equal so not complying with one branch is not impeachable. The 3rd branch, the courts, would determine if ignoring the subpoenas was legit. If not, then they would be forced to comply. If they were legit then they would continue to ignore them. End of story."
Trump doesnt need to prove innocence. That's not how America works. The house needed to prove he was guilty. And just like Russian collusion we all know this is a hoax impeachment in order to try and damage trump's reputation in order to meddle with the upcoming election. 
"If the impeachment was so vital to our nation, the dems wouldn't be holding onto the articles like a bunch of spoiled children. "
The court of public opinion has spoken. And most agree this is a sham. We will all move on and enjoy the rest of our 5 years of Trump.
[removed]
"False.  You can ask for a trial, AND as president you CAN claim executive privilege BY LAW.  It’s then up to the prosecutor, the creepy Schiff and his minions to go through the courts to litigate the executive privilege claims.  This is how this works, it’s not an opinion, it IS the legal process of the law.  The idiot house members thought they would be cute and go around the courts.  This is asinine and an obvious coop to go around legal and ethical precedent, and the brainwashed (YOU) believe anything they and the liberal media say."
The entire phone call doesnt exist. Transcripts like the one released are how every top level call goes.
Almost all republican witnesses were denied. Republicans were prevented from asking legit questions to witnesses. You are a liar and a traitor to the country.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
"If this was any other field of work this bitch would be fired too bad there’s no way to get her old ass out.
Schifty should be fired as well."

"It's like when Nolan Ryan is throwing a no-hitter, but the other team is losing so badly they've put one of their outfielders in to pitch the last couple of innings. Very sad."
"as a Nolan Ryan fan, this is a great reply"
"Thanks! I was a huge fan as well. Still am, and always will be, I guess. Got to see him live a few times back in the last few years of his career, as I don't live too far out from Dallas-Fort Worth. "
"I've got one or maybe both of his Rangers no hitters on VCR tapes, but I've no VCR to play them with. LOL."
"VCRs are always in Goodwill for a few dollars,  or you can pay for a format conversion. 
I still have a bunch of his cards"
I've got one which was his last year with the Mets. It's got a wrinkle on it though. 
"There are some great classic games, in their entirety,  on YouTube. Like I know his 5th no hitter is there, or it was. And there was a fantastic game from his first year with the Rangers where he's up against Clemens, and both of them were in top form that day."
And the video of him beating up Ventura when he rushed the mound
That was so exciting. I was watching that on television when it happened. I bet Nolan approved of Rougned Odor's punching Jose Bautista. LOL.

Biden isn’t going to be the nominee
On the latest polls Biden has widened his lead to +11 points. God only knows how
Same reason all the polls had Hillary winning by a landslide.
"Just yesterday I was reading about Bernie in front.  Personally I'd like to see Biden, I dont see him as a threat and even in the remote possibility of winning wont get anything done.  Bernie scares me."
Bernie would be the only contender against trump. And he would wield as much power as people would let him.
They’ll all back out then have Hillary take the nomination and lose again
"Seems more like a guy who is looking ""90""."
Just pack it in already.
"Bernie had a heart attack at the start of the summer; they hadn't even started serious campaigning yet. Warren said she's raising taxes on everyone, and they proved the math on her plans doesn't work. Mayor Pete is hated by the minorities of the tiny town he governed(not even the top 3 in the state; only 100K) "
"That's Biden's closest competition. A man who could die any day, a woman that already committed political suicide, and an incompetent idiot that would cost the party two of its most treasured voting blocks (blacks and Latinos) So it's not so hard to see why he's in the lead."
Biden likely cries himself to sleep with thoughts of himself being the entitled one-alone.

"Lol no way. Much easier to keep going up the going back down. People always want more. Same reason it’s so hard to raise taxes. It’s why this country will never pay its debt down. I’ve lost all hope for that ever happening. Maybe if we stuck with the tea party movement, but that whole thing and the the thought of fiscal responsibility doesn’t seem to exists in any party honestly. The last round of tax cuts proves that without a doubt. Sucks."
"Yeah i only really see Rand Paul and Mike Lee (as far as the Senate goes) talk about the budget like that, and it’s sad to see them get ignored. It’s also gives me mixed opinions for Mike Lee because at the same can’t support his immigration stance for open borders which ironically helps defeat the purpose of being a budget hawk."

"Wait, aren’t the Dems all for legalizing drugs though? Yet republicans are the drug addicts? 🤨"
"I would say the libertarians more than the Dems.  That being said, it'll always be in someone else's neighborhood, not their own."
"Well, I come to that conclusion because it seems that all the blue states want to legalize recreational marijuana and are very lax when it comes to cracking down on drugs (not to mention the outrageous homeless issue these places also have, coincidence?), while the red states seem to be harsher on drug control."
Some of the countries they adore have legalized all drugs and utilized some successful programs.  That being said these are homogeneous smaller countries with very small populations in comparison to the USA.  These programs are also very expensive up front and unpredictable with such a large diverse population.  
"Yanno, I'll give credit to the hippies and classical liberals.  At least they attempted to live like what they preach.  Yeah they didn't bathe and what not but at least they weren't rich and simultaneously bashing the rich.  Yeah there was definitely some hypocrites but compared to now its trivial. "
"Sorry for the side rant, it just naturally comes out when I have to talk about the left."

It's funny how the Republican party was dead and out of touch in 2008. There was no way they were ever going to win again.
Me waiting for that democrat “permanent majority” to happen: skeletonOnParkbench.jpeg
I’m surprised that more people aren’t offended by this nonsense idea that I’d you’re part of certain minority groups then good member of that group then you have to vote a certain way.  Yak about soft racism.  That’s it right there.  It’s essentially “you’re too stupid to think for yourself.  Vote with the group.”
"Unlike Obama, President Trump has had a positive impact on the economy in black communities. Black voters can see the reality of lower unemployment and more take home pay. The Democratic party's attacks on the president are all too familiar."
About time! What actually has the Democratic Party done to help black party?
Hey whoever is brigading this post can eff off. All new posts have either 0 or -1 upvotes until they become popular.
There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?
CTE is really horrible.
"If blacks ever did vote majority Republican, then affirmative action and minority set asides would become ""conservative"" positions. Please stop pandering."
Strange how well they did voting Republican from the beginning of the party until the lies of FDR and Johnson put them back under the slave party belt

"Winning arguments with libs is easy these days, their ideas are ridiculous."
"Plus, you shouldn’t even argue with them. What’s the point anyway? Their opinions don’t matter"
This is the same dangerous logic that nazi punchers use.  Its always important to try to spread truth and convince those who disagree in a civilized manor.
"I mean, they kind of matter, they vote after all"
"Let them vote, do you honestly think you can change the way they vote?"
"I mean, obviously not most of them but enough of them to play a potential part in Trump's election"
"Yes you can. I believe I have swayed a vote or two within my family. Many people just watch CNN, and follow their narrative. If you can prove the MSM is pure bullshit you can start to open eyes."
snowflakevictory.com
"In my experience you don't ''win'' against leftist. They will keep screaming they are right no matter how wrong you prove them to be. The best you can do is expect others to see how crazy they are by taking them to a point where they have to show their true colors and that they have no arguments, leaving them in ridicule. "
"But as a personal experience, only one in a million leftists will look into his own arguments, re think his own ideas, and admit if he is wrong that he is wrong. And I say that as an ex socialist."
​
Also as a little add. That page is terrible. they don't mention the leftists's arguments and points of view. it's just a partisanship form of argument. It shouldn't say how to win against liberals. It should be how to win against non liberals. You can't win if you dont know with which lies or misinformation leftists come up with. You need to be prepared for them.
​
"For example in the Biden case, leftist argue that Biden did nothing wrong because the prosecutor was demonstrated corrupt."
"If you go into an argument where you think just showing Biden's clip will solve anything you are wrong. It is very naive to believe leftists will just understand they are wrong if you show them evidence,. They are gold medal mental gymnastic athletes."
"Arguments with them must be pursued to the point all they can do is insult, repeat themselves ad nauseam, or say things that are so blatantly and obviously a lie that no one hearing them believes them."
"One good example of everything I'm saying here is Crowder's show, this episode to be specific  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of1Od0n_y34"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of1Od0n_y34</a> "
​
Sources: 8 years of arguing with leftists.
The intresting thing for me is that you can take out almost everything from your comment. Replace left/liberal for right/conservative and I can totally see someone on the left saying this exact same thing
"Will you remind me which party has a lot of different flavors of self proclaimed socialism running for them ?
Say certain self proclaimed ''democratic socialists'' ?"
I am not sure how that is related to my comment. But the right also has a decent amount of disntinctions ranging from conservartive to libertarian to anarch
I'm sorry I think I misunderstood what you said.
"This is exactly correct. Never debate a leftist one on one, because they will never change their mind. It's the people listening to both arguments that will be enlightened."
"It's the same for most debates. Each side is usually focused on the next point so they aren't listening to the other person. It's especially true for libs because their positions are so divorced from reality that they need to remember what CNN told them rather than thinking about how the world actually works, but everyone can fall prey. The irony is not lost on me while we are talking about a literal debate talking points list for Republicans."
"Debates are for the benefit of the audience. The list is good for steering the conversation toward actual accomplishments in a conversation, but lacking for a verbal brawl. It's probably best used as a list to trick someone into reading so they might accidentally find something, then learn about it instead of taking the Pelosi Party Line."
Half of them aren't read up on the issues and if you question anyone they call you a troll. If you then try to point out BO's inaccuracies they leave the room! They just don't know or choose to be blind. 
"The other half don't know if they're moderate, corporate or Progressive Dems! "
They are only United by their hatred for Trump and that's far worse than not knowing what your own guys stand for?
I dunno who is downvoting you but I'm gonna bet is a pissed of leftist with multi accounts.
Is there such a thing...
Only 8 years?! Those are rookie numbers! You got to get those up!
"Need a part 2: How to make them understand when they lose something (e.g., an argument, the presidency, their minds, etc.)"
"It is not difficult. Other than very moderate Democrats, I haven’t ever argued with one that had an argument that couldn’t be rebutted in one sentence or less."
Luckily I dont have any Liberal relatives
"We already won, and see you again next year."
Amazing!

"The Impeachment has only proven how un-American  the Democratic party actually is, sadly."
[removed]
"Also theres the fact that since Eisenhower, every elected Republican president has had articles of impeachment pushed against them, so its lost its power (Ford is the only Republican president who hasnt had AoI pushed against them). "
"Also the ""witnesses"" as their testimony in the house shows, arent witnesses. They were not apart of the call, they were not present during the call, and only got information second hand. Unless something else happened since they were called up, they dont even qualify as whistleblowers, as that requires running into proof during you job not second hand rumors."
"I'll admit I'm out of date from what I know, so new info may have surfaced from when I last paid attention. I'll also admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Trump. His domestic and economic policies are fine, I'm for border control, but his foriegn policy, especially towards Japan and the Indo Pacific I take issue with."
"I'm just even less favorable towards the Democrats, as they have, by the by, swung further left. The few moderates left are being pressured into primaries if they dont fall in line with the parties ideals. That's not healthy, and that's not showing what, as representatives of their districts, what the people voted them in for. This is also an issue with the Republicans, but the Democrats are the more egregious offenders at the moment."
"The reason McConnell is saying he is not impartial is because the process hasn't been impartial so far. There isn't a crime proven, the Democrats had to drop bribery from their list (which would've been a crime) because they didn't have the evidence."
"Both articles of impeachment are awful. Abuse of power is subjective, there isn't a rule that says ""this is abuse of power"". Obstruction of Congress is not even a thing, Congress is not all powerful, we have 3 powers so if anyone in the Executive says no to a subpoena, Congress needs to involve the Judiciary branch (which they didn't) so they can solve any dispute between the Executive and the Legislative branches. In the end the Democrats followed through with impeachment more because they had been talking about it than because they had any evidence. "
"While it's true that you don't need a crime to impeach a president, if you don't have one it looks more like you just don't like the guy and wanted to get rid of him, which is why McConnell doesn't think this has been a fair process."
They've been talking about impeaching Trump every since election night 2016
Not even the partisan one sided trial with only hearsay ‘evidence’ came up with a crime ... but you have? In the transcript?
Please quote the exact part of the transcript that is this crime?

"Impeachment helped Clinton too, but, the mere mention of impeachment not working sends Dems in a tizzy."
The recent bipartisan passage of the USMCA or reworked NAFTA is a huge win for him as well and gives him bragging rights on the campaign trail.
Yes it is. 538 averages dozens of polls and they’re showing a very steady ~43% approval. He got a little bump from the impeachment recently but really it’s been very steady. 
Approval doesn’t necessarily mean “people who are going to vote for him” either. If asked I would say I disapprove but I’m still likely to vote for him (as a moderate conservative)
"Hmm.. and that bump will go even higher once, he gets acquitted by the Senate, I suppose.."
"Trump is really a lot like Nixon in some ways.  Not in the ""paying off someone to commit burglary"" kind of way.  But in the sense that he is capable of delivering real results and achieving great foreign policy wins for the country despite being villainized every single day by a hostile media.  Were it not for Watergate, Nixon would have gone down as one of the most successful and effective presidents in history.  As long as Trump never gives in to the temptation to repay Democrats for their abuses of power, he will certainly hold that title."
Everyone hates on trump even tho he was one of the best presidents we have ever had
"Not sure about best ever, he’s got some solid competition."

"I mean they don't have to, but they will. Opportunity to end some politicians careers."
"They actually could go ahead and have the trial.  There's no law that says they have to wait for the articles to be hand delivered to the Senate.  They could just pull the articles that were passed in House from the government's own website and use those to begin the trial and address the charges.  However, it's more politically advantageous to us Republicans to let Pelosi continue to weaken her case.  As long as she is refusing to deliver the articles, she looks like she isn't confident in her case.  And the longer Schumer demands witness and document production in the Senate, the more he admits the House's process was woefully inadequate.  "
"So, while yes, we could go ahead and put this to bed, I see no reason to do so.  It's a political win for Republicans and a fundraising gold mine."

"Thanks GWB , for the Patriot Act"
"So true, that guy was from the same thread as Obama.  That is why those two hit it off so well.  Definitely not what he appeared to be."
This was a coordinated effort.
Nelly Ohr who worked for Fusion GPS was funneling information to her husband Bruce Ohr DOJ attorney who was then supplying it to the FBI.
Their daughter Kelly Ohr works for Buzzfeed news who along with Yahoo news broke the story that the investigation had begun into Trump. 
This was a collective effort by the Dems and bad faith actors. They lie for any political advantage and have done nothing but kept people down or mislead them.
When they say Russia influenced an election I have to agree but what they did was far worse. If not for Trumps win this would have never been exposed and they would continue as such.
Thank you Trump for making everyone a civics major and firing those FBI agents who needed to go.
This was a coordinated effort.
If they were any sort of investigation in any way they'd find the FBI was acting at the direction of the Hillary's campaign (through the DNC and the Steele dossier) and Obama (who is in charge of the Executive Branch and hence the FBI). Spying on a campaign is what brought down Nixon. 
"This is why Hillary had to bring up ""Muh Russians"" before she even lost the election - as a misdirection away from here own grave malfeasances which warrants far more scrutiny than Trumps phone call with the Ukrainians (or anything else we have seen to this point for that matter up to this point) ever will."
"Liberals just are not being honest with themselves here, and really are not concerned about justice in the least. From day one of Trump's presidency it's been all about subverting conservatives votes. Something that should make every person here quite angry."
"Remember when the report came out and it was rush to, ""No Bias Was Found."""
No one cared about the details. The abuse of power. Spying on a presidential candidate and misleading the American people for three years wasting money and effort.
It was a this hit is not on us post.
The Trump presidency has taught me that people are responsible for what is allowed and the shit coming out of the hill is proof we have lost our way.
"They want socialism and to be controlled. Not freedom and self prosperity? No, the Government will give me my purpose."
That is not who we are and I will make damn sure it will never be. The government exists to protect us and let us flourish. We take care of our own in our community and we have failed them. Not the government us.
The green new deal is a socialist blueprint. Bernie Sanders will rob from the rich to enact insane new policies for apathetic morons who wont do for themselves.
Thatis not our way.
"I have a pessimistic view of this. Most people take it for granted that they are being surveilled and don't care as long as they get their iphones. It's only when rights are taken away do they wake up. So, yea, this will pass silently in the night instead of the shit storm it should raise."
I agree. The politicalizaton of our intelligence agencies is shocking and wrong as well as illegal. President Trump continues to expose government corruption.

Cheating how? He has obvious character flaws but he champions conservative values so I am okay with those flaws.
"As long as Democrats continue to lie, polarize and establish a welfare state I will align myself with unsavory characters. I wont let them do to me which they have done to their voters."

your on the wrong sub

"im in my bubble dummy, and if you think dems dont hold allegiance for their party before anything else you’re wrong. im just here to let you know you’re stupid."
[removed]
"actually the reason they were unanimous was because the impeachment was unfounded and bullshit. thats why dems weren’t because there were like three who actually have a brain. im good anywhere actually id be in <a href=""/r/politics"" rel=""nofollow"">r/politics</a> if they weren’t biased and everytime a conservative makes an actual point they ban you, but thats a liberal thing im sure youd know."
"And Republicans were unanimous on the impeachment vote, Dems were not."
"This shows the opposite of your point Dummy. This impeachment was such a farce that Democrats voted against their own party, even after being threatened by DNC leadership. This was the most one sided partisan impeachment in history."
[removed]
"Democrats have lied about Russia, Supreme Court judges. Anything to advance their agenda. They provide generational welfare."
Look at their cities. Your truth is in their own districts and they are shit covered third world countries!
"Trump is an immoral person but a damn good president. I dont like it either but that is where we are. I will continue to support him against the left's racist, bigoted, freedom stripping through hyperbolic bullshit agenda."
Have a merry christmas.
I think it has been going on for many years and has been manipulated by the top.   It sucks!
FISA court abuse has been a long standing problem for our intelligence agencies and it needs to be fixed. That doesn't come close to covering up impeachment for me though.
Covering up impeachment how? Dems say bribery and dont apply bribery charges because they cant substantiate the charge.
Secret servers and documents that no one knows about to create suspicion is a laughable tactic. 
"Perhaps, the Dems should have demonstrated better values and applicable policy other than steal from the rich and create more poor."
"I just mean in terms of the article trying to distract from impeachment, what the FBI did wasn't exactly unprecedented where as what President Trump is alleged to have done is."
"Can you tell me what that was. They had one witness to the actual conversation, Sunderland. He said no. It was not quid pro quo. In fact. He stated no quid pro quo. So, what is the argument."
"I'm not sure how the House is going to argue their case, I think all the Intelligence Committee hearings were pretty damning although I didn't read the report yet. From what I've heard it seems that, if true, President Trump impounded Congressionally mandated military aid to the Ukrainians to aid them in their war against Russia and was holding onto it until at least an announcement that the Ukrainians would open an investigation into Hunter Biden's dealings with Barizma(which would be a political favor)."
"Sondeland was probably the Republican's best witness, Bill Taylor and Laura Cooper's testimony were definitely the most shocking to hear. Pretty sure Bill Taylor even quit over whatever took place."
"You presented a clear and open case. Thank you. Very, very rewarding. I was not expecting this. Sincerely, thank you. I do not think he was pressuring ukraine for Biden. I think this was more about what happened in 2016."
"no one on cnn or msnbc would ever report this because thatd insinuate that dems actually did something wrong, and god forbid anyone be wrong unless its donald trump."
They control the narrative. Three years of perpetual gaslighting and fear mongering. 
MSNBC race bates and turns a blind eye to Matt Lauer.
CNN has a host of actors and their one journalist Wolf Blitzer is reduced to responding to their loaded questions.
Fox and OANN could turn down the rhetoric now and then but that actually report the news.
I wish Trump was not all that we talked about but the media will not go another night without saying his name for another decade.
"the saddest part is when i search i have to use duckduckgo cause anything thats not bashing our president is on like page 3/4. and they continue to try to tell us google isnt biased, when its clear that it is. they dont even give americans the chance to choose, they’re trying to make peoples mind up for them by blasting people with out of context sound bites and a lot of times flat out lies, remember those high school kids with the maga hats getting drummed at by a native american?"
"The sad part is, that should be common sense. Interest parties who want your time and energy to influence you are common place."
The left has a plan and they have the infrastructure to see it through.
these days a lot of people don’t operate on common sense. the people i see who are the worst are the ones who’s emotions are easily manipulated.
"Ask yourself, who even fucking cares anymore. We are being taught to not care and let others think for us."
"Eventually, it will be to where the phone recommends words and people just comply."
No one cares. That's the truth. We are being conditioned to not care but bitch about how bad it is.
We are becoming a parody of a tragedy of our design.
Well doesn’t seem like there’s a way to stop that
"Is that not the sad truth. We are automatically being recommendations how to think. To comply. As if, the people who are supplying the technology dont have a bet in that race."
"If you are like me, which, based on your responses you are, being afraid is sane. Logical free thought will be a side distraction to the mass populace of Wall-E type agreeance."
Google is the prime example of that too.
We are no longer in the realm of commonality but that of bias. For certain. Till they can eat their own. Trump has unite them. Fringe and all.
Looking at that guys smug look tells you everything you need to know about him....elitist!  Think of all of the people that guy falsely railroaded  just because he disagreed with them or was trying to make brownie points to get into the pants of Lisa Page.
Absolutely it is / how long has the deep state been doing this ??

There is already plenty of evidence that Trump abused his power regardless of if you want to turn a blind eye to it.
"No, there isn't.  I've read every single transcript that has been made available and watched every single hearing that was televised.  There isn't a shred of evidence that he abused his power.  Not even one tiny bit of evidence.  Not one witness was able to testify under oath to having any kind of a corrupt purpose communicated to them.  Sonland came the closest, but even he admitted that he just assumed some corrupt purpose and then testified that ""no human being on this planet"" ever told him that there would be any conditions placed on Ukraine.  And he also testified that in his direct conversation with the president that he was plainly told that Trump wanted nothing."
"This isn't being blind to anything.  This is looking at the entirety of the evidence presented.  The only way you could come to the conclusion that Trump did abuse his power would be to dishonestly ignore evidence inconvenient to your argument, be ill-informed and simply not know about the evidence that contradicts the claim that he abused his power, or to not have an understand of what ""abuse of power"" actually means."

I would rather see a trial and drag the dems through the mud.
Nah this isn't doing conservatives any favors and besides that you're giving Pelosi what she wants. More B.S. talking points that they can parrot on the news as real.
"i disagree, seeing hunter biden's corruption will help republicans against joe biden in 2020. also the fact that the trial is based on nothing"
This is the real reason for Pelosi's  delay. She knows how fast it'll die in the Senate.
"While they could do this, it would be unwise. Better to follow the process as layed out in the Constitution. They would be more respected by history for having done the right thing vs their counterparts in the House whose ""Impeachment"" was an unconstitutional sham."
Jh
So true would look way better down the road but if they want to play it safe and prevent this from happening in the future (and I mean even Republicans trying to do this the same way as them) then it's best to change it now while we can.
"If the GOP were to just dismiss without a trial of any sort, there’s a good possibility of the Dems taking the Senate. Yes, I think the GOP could regain the House, but while the public would vote out the Dems for their House behavior, they would see the GOP as doing similar in the Senate and act accordingly next November."
"Republicans want the trial though.  We need to use it to investigate the Biden corruption, FBI corruption, and Schiff's connection to the ""whistleblower""."
All of the things that the Democrats worked so hard to hide in the House need to be dragged into the sunlight in the Senate.
"Trump will be exonerated as well, of course, but that won't even be the focus of the Senate trial."
The media will spin any new evidence as somehow damaging to Trump.
The main stream media isn't as powerful as it used to be.  If it was Trump never would have won in 2016.
"That doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. His presidency has weakened it from the day he took office. In fact, the “peak” of MSM influence was when they straight up lied to the people with fraudulent polls, then acting all surprised when they were dead wrong. It was at that moment they knew that they cannot control the minds of Americans. With the exception of the hopeless imbeciles."
"Exactly.  Just get this over with.  FFS, they didn't even charge Trump with a real crime and he got impeached.  Just end this already.  Also if the republicans are actually dumb enough to do a trial you are setting a precedent that what happened in the House must be taken seriously."
[removed]
"Abuse of power is not a crime, it's way too vague and is up for interpretation.  Good luck in any court charging anyone with abuse of power without them commiting any specific crime.  If Trump abused power why not charge him with an actual crime?"
Exactly why the Dems are resisting.
"Probably better to let the trial go so the dems can provide us more video evidence of their insanity. Idk who they think they are winning over with this, but it’s definitely not mainstream democrats,"
"Idk who they think they are winning over with this,"
They want to appease their fanatical base. Most sane moderates have left the party already.
I think that there should be a trial regardless.
"Only if they bring in the Bidens, Schiff, and Ciaramella. Chalupa too. Otherwise what’s the point?"
"I’d put a deadline of a reasonable time (a month) for the House to pass over the articles, if not vote without a trial. There is no precedent for withholding, it is bad optics though for just dismissing it though"
It's not like various precedents haven't been broken before.
No... Like 48 hours. Enough of this. Either they have it or not. Due Christmas day.
Wait two days after Christmas.
If they hold it until the next congress comes in it just dies
"No, the House will just re-confirm the vote at the most. Not that it shouldn't just die."
"My understanding is that the Senate needs to change their process to move forward if the House does not deliver the articles.  I'm going off of information from this interview by Liz Wheeler at OAN:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aPkR8lrtLU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aPkR8lrtLU</a>.  If that information is incorrect, please post the correct information as I (and I'm sure many others) are not clear on the actual process in this situation."
"Honestly, though, I do agree that there should be a trial so that all the antics from the House be exposed.  I also agree that the Senate should ""offer"" a reasonable deadline for the House to deliver the articles.  Something like 2-3 weeks should be enough, IMHO."
"To add a little more to the discussion or to just throw my opinion out there:  I don't think Pelosi ever intended to deliver the articles to the Senate.  The strategy that her party is going for is that every Democrat running for a seat in the House and the Senate are going to be stating that Trump has been impeached and that they (the Democrats) are the only ones who had the courage to stand up to Trump and take him down.  The second talking point the Democrats are going to try is that Trump would be removed from office, but the Republicans in the Senate refuse to make it a fair trail, so the voters need to go to the polls and flip the Senate to Democratic control for a fair trial and removal of Trump if he is reelected."
If this happens it would be hilarious.
They should.  Shut this nonsense down.
"They should give it 15 days, and then send it to SCotTS to be voided for failure to follow the constitution, effectively being a voiding of the impeachment, and a formal dropping of all charges; recounting the record, so to speak. The democrats wouldn't even be able to claim they had impeached him."
"I'm the other hand, if the democrats do grow a spine and send it over, try it fully; expose all the criminal activities the democrats want to keep hidden that Biden and his son did, that Obama and his administration did, that the various congressional democrats did. And keep Warren and Bernie too busy in hearings to campaign."
"I mean, they could.  The articles of impeachment are public record.  It's not like they are some super secret document.  The Senate could quite literally just print them from the House's own website and take them up if the wanted to.  This idea that they have to be couriered to the Senate in person is ludicrous."
"And that’s what they should do. No show trial, no delay of important business, just acquit immediately and put the babies back in their place. Democrats are an illegitimate party, they have no right to gum up the work of congress"
[removed]
"Their actions. Democrats have no interest in the improvement of this country, only in destroying it."
[removed]
"The current term of democrats will be known for only one thing. Trying to remove president Trump from office and failing to do so. No move forward on fixing our broken healthcare, border security, trade with China, or anything that actually normal Americans care about. These Democrats are a waste of everyone’s time and money."
Doesn’t McConnell have hundreds of bills on his desk that he refused to hold a vote on?
[removed]
Doesn't mean he's been removed from office tho
"Ugh, if you don’t know already you have your head in the sand. Search “Democrats being jackasses” and leave your concern trolling elsewhere."
Democrats are traitors and everyone knows it.
They are selfish and just trying to make money. No interest in what is best for America AT ALL.

The Democrats might be holding on to it I'm the off chance that they take the Senate in 2020 or 2022. This could be a way bigger issue than people realize.
Is conviction simple majority or 2/3? I doubt they'd ever plan on getting 2/3 so they'd have no reason to hold onto it that long
2/3- 67 Senators
[removed]
Its a crazy gamble.  This is just going to spill over during the general election and there won't be anything groundbreaking.  It will make them all look like fools
"Iirc it’s 2/3, and if I’m correct on that then we’re almost certainly safe."
You are correct
so they'd have no reason to hold onto it that long
But that's how deluded they are. That there will suddenly be this huge moral outrage ground swell that we will all suddenly vote for democrats again - and they will have both houses of congress.
If only we could see the light of why we shouldn't have voted for Trump in 2016 and Hillary is the better candidate for president.
There is literally zero chance that the Dems get a 2/3 majority in the Senate
"Doesn’t matter. If they gain a majority, they choose the rules. And the senate has the explicit power to compel witness attendance"
"There is literally no circumstance in which the Senate goes blue, but Trump is re-elected. Impeachment is for the removal of Presidents, not to punish Presidents once they've left office."
In contrary the Republicans could take the House though in 2020 and toss it
[removed]
Just like the Dems had fair hearings? GTFO.
[removed]
[removed]
"Dems wouldn't let the Republicans hold a minority hearing, like there suppose too. They also wouldn't let the Republicans call many of their own witnesses."
"The difference being that the dems didn't straight up say ""I will not be an impartial juror"" before the hearings."
Democrats wouldn’t really give a fair trial either. They didn’t
When? There has never been a Democrat-led impeachment trial
2022 is going to be a tough year for Republicans in the senate. They’ll have to defend way more senate seats than democrats
They can’t hold onto it like that.
"If they wait until a new senate, then the articles are voided."
"Are you sure? I thought they could hold on to bills as long as they wanted. This is some new territory, no doubt."
"This isnt a ""bill"""
That's what I meant by new territory. I want sure if it worked the same way as a bill. Didn't do a good job explaining that. My bad.
Are you sure?
"I'm quite sure Mitch McConnell is sure and will force them to go back and do it again. And of course they will, because they think voters besides the fanatical left will buy into it."
Where are you getting this data?
"They can't. There is a time limit,  and they won't take the Senate if we all vote."
I'm from the Netherlands so not all to firmiliar with the process. Could it be possible that thr democrates whould hold out to bring the impeachment to the senate untill they might hold a majority? And if so whould that come before presidential elections? Whould seem highly corrupt.
It will be voided when there is a new senate voted in.  They'd have to start over again
Do you have a source for that? This is new territory.
Ah that is good to know. Thanks.
Now that’s funny.  This was a great episode of always sunny too.
I used to love that show :(
"I used to, too. When did you stop loving it?"
"Season 13, I'm okay with shows being pretty liberal, and the show has always been a little liberal and that was okay because they didn't really bring it up much. Season 13 just pushed the limits a little bit, I haven't seen the whole season as I stopped around episode 5, but I just didn't like the feel of the show anymore. I may come back at a later date, but as of right now I just watch the old episodes. (seasons 1-10)"
I stopped after the season they got this meme from. Haven't bothered to go back to it.
"Hmm, yeah it kind of only went downhill from there."

Jesus christ with the biased shit. I'm not even going to read your comment because you were fishing for an argument in the first place
"Either way, you're wrong, its debatable."
[removed]
except you dont.
"you come at me saying im wrong. demand a source, then try to immediately discredit the source with ""ermagod bias"" its not the only place that has that article, it was the first one that i so politely googled for you; since you were too lazy to."
it is evident that you are looking for an argument as you reply to someone who no longer wishes to engage with you. 
"not to mention your arrogant comment is hilariously lacking self awareness. the point of my original comment is that it is debatable whether or not trump can be considered impeached, and here we are debating it. "
"you either lack the self awareness to understand what i said, or you're being intentional obtuse and hostile. either way, i think we're better off leaving this alone here."
You are correct that it is not up for debate. Technically not impeached until the articles are delivered to the Senate so they can start their part of the process. Impeachment is a workflow and Dems have halted the workflow before it completed.
That's about right. The silliness will end in the Senate. It's a shame that some people hate President Trump so much that reason and intelligent thought go right out the window.
Finally a non-boomer meme!
Will we win 2020?
Are they voting? And if so when
More importantly..don’t waste any more money on it..blatant waste of tax dollars

"As much as I hate douchebags who block the road, it isn’t legal to hit them"
This has to be some of the worst legal advise I’ve ever seen on reddit. It’s never ok to hit someone with your car intentionally. Doesn’t matter where you are. Where do you even get information like this from!?
The more correct way to view it is that you will not automatically be charged with manslaughter JUST because your vehicle hit someone.
A.You must have behaved knowingly and/or negligently and be found at least partially responsible for what happened in order to be charged.
"B. You can also be charged for failing to stop and help someone you’ve hit, whether it was a pedestrian or another car."
Generally those practicing civil disobedience expect to get arrested and welcome it. So what is your evidence that they consider themselves “above the law?”
They’re still breaking the law. They think they are above it because they think what they view as moral justifies breaking the law.
Sometimes t is required to break the law. Not all laws are just. If someone sees an injustice they have a moral imperative to right it. I understand though. One is not wrong in wondering and being concerned about how society determines good and just laws. Protest is American. I wonder if African Americans or gays would have the rights they do. Was not America’s original settlers act of founding a new country a deliberate act of protest against tyrannical disrespect for freedom of religion? Viva la democracy
Yeah standing in the street to stop people who have no affect over what you are protesting is different from rebelling against blatantly immoral people with power. Pretty much everything you typed has nothing to do with idiots standing in streets. They can’t be compared to people who actually risked their lives for the rights of people.
They want to do some real protesting throw some boxes of tea into a river like a real hero
They don’t expect to get their legs to get broken by moving traffic?
"Well, the last one that did was called racist and went to jail for manslaughter."
The fact that they are still deliberately breaking the law for what they see as their own gains.  
Is this a serious question?
"But they welcome arrest, so they don’t believe they are above the law. Idk what protest this is and yeah it might not be the most effective/smart but they’re breaking the law to make a point, much like protests throughout the history of our country have done."
Where was this?
[removed]
No one is above the law?
They support abortions outside the mother's womb.
They support sanctuary cities.
"Also democrats: we don’t believe the Senate will vilify and conduct the impeachment trial as unfairly, unconstitutionally, and with as much hate towards the president as we did, so we’re not going to let them try him in the name of “fairness”."
"As a democrat, people like make me embarrassed. Totally relate to this post."
Is there a reason you can’t just slowly push them with your car?
"Not a good move in this country. They can fall over say you hit them and sue the shit out of you/your insurance. I’ve had to deal with some real assholes after the tiniest tap ever. No visible damage, and after a year of nonsense they got $5k for nothing. Showed me that if someone sees a chance to make money they’ll take it. Not worth it as much as I’m sure I’d be thinking about it if I was stuck in that shit. I’d be losing my mind. Haha"

"Immigrants shouldn’t be counted in the census towards house seats. The only reason they should be counted is to track who to DEPORT. The moment that form is submitted, boom, ICE should be at their door with handcuffs and a bus ticket back to country of origin."
Democrats have too much representation as it is. All our policy is being managed by a few blue cities. 10% is running the 90
"The census is meant for population reasons, not how many US citizens there are. Plus not all non-citizens are illegal. Also if there was a question about citizenship on the census, there would be quite the number of people who wouldnt answer it because the punishment is only a $100 fine. So the result would be false population numbers which is whole reason for census."
"Non citizens should have zero rights.. and citizenship should be a right that is earned and MAINTAINED. Even if you are born here, citizenship should be stripped from those who break our laws or attempt to damage this country"
"again, the census is not to see how many US citizens there are, it is to see how many people (majority are legal just do not have citizenship by the way) are living in certain regions. And to your post, why would there be no rights to people who live here legally that sounds terrible and like something a 3rd world country would do."
"Illegals are just that, illegal. If they are counted, “sanctuary” cities are suddenly over represented, while cities that comply with the law are under represented. We should only be counting illegals as much as it takes to get them on a bus to their country of origin."
"The rights afforded by the constitution must have limits. If you aren’t a citizen, then the rights afforded by the constitution shouldn’t apply. "
"Fastest way to becoming a third world country is to have no borders. I’d be happiest knowing my tax dollars aren’t being spent to support some parasite from another country, wouldn’t you?"
"You are treating non citizens and illegals as the same thing, there are many people who are documented but dont have citizenship yet. So why do you think  people who are legally here should not have rights. And yes illegal people should be deported but do not call people parasites, that is very disrespectful."
"I know what I was talking about. Citizens and immigrants should be separated groups, and immigrants need to be able to be tracked and seized as soon as they break the law or overstay their visa, and the only way to do that is to afford them less rights than normal citizens. Should they have due process? Sure, but it shouldn’t be the same as citizens, they need to be able to be deported quickly, none of this court back and forth nonsense. Should the my have access to emergency room care? Maybe, but their healthcare needs to be able to be paid for as a contingency of staying in the country. The constitution is meant to protect citizens, it can’t apply to everyone who happens to set foot in America or else we wouldn’t be able to control their flow."
"And they are parasites as soon as they take refuge here. The moment they set foot in this country they immediately have access to infrastructure built by our tax dollars, and not a cent of theirs. They are parasite invaders and their presence is only tolerated if they can give back more than they bite off."
"IMHO there should be a constitutional amendment that only people born in the US should be allowed to vote. If that were the law, non of this would matter."
Anytime I see something like this...  
All our policy is being managed by a few blue cities. 10% is running the 90
I wonder if the author has ever seen a population density map?
If people cluster in areas they should not give up some of there voting power.... what kind of crazy logic is that?
10% of what?  Are you basing your voting allocation on square miles of territory?
"This is why the Republican's refusal to do something about immigration is going to destroy this nation. They held congress for two years during Trump's term, and they didn't do squat about this at all. Half of them obstructed Trump's efforts.

Winning 2020!!!!

She seems to be trying not to land in the briar patch....mid flight....
Obviously the point is to have Trump in the history books as officially impeached and never cleared by the Senate. He clearly isn't going to be removed from office by this and the proceedings aren't changing many voters minds. 
One of the few things people 100 years from now will know about Trump is that he was impeached.
"Disagree all you want, but it isn't necessarily a dumb strategy."
"Eh.  I think anyone who looks up any of the past impeachments can tell they were all incredibly politically motivated, although how history frames this one is still up in the air.  Will it mention that democratic congresspeople campaigned specifically to impeach the president?  Will it mention the former vice president's family's ties to certain businesses?  Or will it only mention that the president wanted foreign help looking into a candidate's past?  I think it's pretty obvious right now that this will be the hardest one to teach young people though"
"<a href=""https://www.history.com/news/how-many-presidents-impeached"">Here's the history channel's write-up.  It's by far the briefest of the three.</a>"
Not impeached until the articles are delivered to the Senate.  They may never get there and so the president is NOT impeached.
"I'm not a constitutional scholar or anything, but I'm pretty sure the Constitution doesn't say that:"
The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. 
"<a href=""https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript"">https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript</a>"
But also the below:
The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments
"Noah Feldman, one of the constitutional scholars that testified in the house argues the below in an op-ed published by Bloomberg. "
"""Strictly speaking, ""impeachment"" occurred – and occurs -- when the articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate for trial. And at that point, the Senate is obliged by the Constitution to hold a trial."""
"<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-19/trump-impeachment-delay-could-be-serious-problem-for-democrats"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-19/trump-impeachment-delay-could-be-serious-problem-for-democrats</a>"
"I'm not a constitutional scholar, but this is what I read from someone who is."
"Possibly they hold it, wait for election to see if they take senate then submit?"
An election will null any pending acts of Congress that haven't been finalized.
"The current session is called the 116 th Congress and it began on Jan 3, 2019. All bills not enacted by the end of the session on Jan 3, 2021 die, and Congress will start over."
"<a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/"">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/</a>"
"But are articles of impeachment ""bills""?"
I'm not sure because this kind of situation where the articles of impeachment are not immediately handed over to the Senate has not happened before in our history.
But there are rulings that say the Congress cannot bind a future Congress to the current policy.  In other words of future session of Congress is allowed to overturn acts by previous sessions of Congress.
"<a href=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/07/can-today-s-congress-tell-tomorrow-s-congress-what-to-do-no-maybe-sort-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/07/can-today-s-congress-tell-tomorrow-s-congress-what-to-do-no-maybe-sort-of.html</a>"
"Source on that? Article 1 section 2 states that the house has sole power of impeachment, section 3 states the senate has the power to try impeachments for removal from office. "
"President Trump is still impeached, the house just isn’t sending the article to the senate for the the trial because they know he won’t be removed from office."
One of the scholars that testified for Democrats during the impeachment hearings.
"<a href=""http://archive.is/it30J"">http://archive.is/it30J</a>"
"""Other legal academics took issue with his view"" "
"This is the opinion of one law professor, not a source."
I mean it's the same person who testified for the dems and favored impeachment. Yes it's an opinion  but its opinion that was used as the basis for the impeachment in the first place.
it's the same person who testified for the dems and favored impeachment
and that ruins his credibility right there
"If I know anything about lawyers, it's never a good point when they start their argument with ""technically speaking..."""
Disagree. Anyone interested quickly looks a deeper into these things. And its going to be even more obvious with Trumps successes. For example: if you were to google 'trump impeached' in 100 years you'll likely read the first paragraph.
​
That paragraph is unwritten -- but im betting it'll be pointing out the Democrat hysteria defining the era.
"How much do you or the average person know about Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Herbert Hoover or Calvin Coolidge?"
I knew Wilson was president 100 years ago just because of WWI but had to google the rest.
I can't think of any hypothetical Trump 'successes' that anyone will care about in the future. Can you?
I know little enough to make no moral judgement which is what we're talking about.
Sure and that's my point. Andrew Johnson had a lot of controversy surrounding him and people saying he had great successes. But if anyone today remembers him at all it's because he was impeached. And I doubt anyone but historians could name the reason why or his political opponents. It'll be the same for Trump.
I think holding on to the impeachment is dumber than the actual impeachment.  
"It shows that it was a farce, clearly and openly.  And the thing is, moderates and independents are sick and tired of congressional theatre.  They want their elected reps to <strong>get shit done</strong>.  They weren't voted in to ""resist"".  That's why Trump's approval rating has spiked.  He's the only one getting shit done."
Politics has always been internecine warfare.
"At this point, holding back isn't dumb on the Democrats part because of what I already said. They know they can't get anything out of it now, might as well cut their losses and leave it on the record. "
"I don't know if I'd say his approval rating has spiked, it's up a percent or two, but for the most part remarkably stable. "
"I think most people realize the economy's been pretty good for the past decade, and that's what matters the most. Listening to Democratic candidates wanting to upend the economy makes Trump look a lot better moreso than the impeachment hearings."
"Quick, genuine question. What about this do you think is going to cause the economy to upend? You said that the economy has been good for a decade, 3 years of trump and the rest under Obama. It would seem then that who the President is wouldn't  matter much right?"
"I do think that the president doesn't matter much, our economy of 330,000,000 people mostly chugs along regardless of who's in the White House. Unless it's someone like Bernie or Warren, who would upend the economy. "
Maybe you misunderstood me - I don't think the impeachment hearings have any effect on the economy at all.
Oh ok. Thank you for your response.
I think the conclusion will be clear...  Donald J. Trump was loathes by his enemies in the Democrat party.  That will literally be the only unavoidable conclusion.
"Pretty sure if it never gets to the senate, it’s null and void, no?"
I believe you are correct because pending legislation of the 116th Congress is null and void when the 117th Congress is seated in January of 2021
"But are articles of impeachment ""legislation""?"
That's a good question because this kind of situation has never happened before.  I'm going to presume the articles of impeachment would expire because one Congress cannot bind another Congress.
"Courts have long held that Congress cannot “bind” future Congresses—that is, it can’t force a future session of Congress to carry on its own policies. That practice, formally known as “legislative entrenchment,” is seen as privileging one group of lawmakers over another, “binding” future to the priorities set in the present."
"<a href=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/07/can-today-s-congress-tell-tomorrow-s-congress-what-to-do-no-maybe-sort-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/07/can-today-s-congress-tell-tomorrow-s-congress-what-to-do-no-maybe-sort-of.html</a>"
So Nancy decides to hold onto it and SCOTUS decides it is null/void in the 117th Congress. Then they do the whole thing over again. 
"I'm pretty sure that if you're sitting on the fence and didn't before, you just might find yourself loathing Pelosi at that point."
"They’re hoping they’ll take the senate in 2020 then remove him when he gets re-elected? Not really sure what crazy Nancy is up to here, other than trying to keep impeachment in the news as long as she can."
"This is the democrats game plan as far as I can tell, they hope to flip the senate sometime in the very near future and then deliver the articles of impeachment when they can win on a party line vote."
"They wouldn’t be able to. They would need to win 67 seats. To do this, they need to take 20/23 of the seats republicans are defending without losing any of their own. And this includes winning senate elections in states like montana, Wyoming, Georgia, Mississippi, oklahoma and South Dakota. I just don’t see it happening"
"What I think is more probable is that they want to win a majority so they can use the trial to subpoena the witnesses that have been kept from testifying (mulvaney, Bolton, pompeo)"
They can’t win a super majority in the senate anytime soon and any articles drafted by the 116th congress cease to be valid when the 117th is seated so they’d need to revote in the house anyway.
"Is there any rule how long she can hold onto this before sending to senate? Can she wait until the Senate flips to Democrats (not that that's forseeable)?
Cruz said these Democrat senators running for prez will be swamped in the Senate with this for 6 weeks and wont be able to campaign. Curious if she is doing it to help them out."
Can she wait until the Senate flips to Democrats (not that that's foreseeable) 
"That's impossible, because in order to impeach a President in the Senate they need a 2/3 majority, or 67 Senators to vote yes on it."
It's actually 2/3 of members present. Not 2/3 of the Senate.
Thanks.  Basically the same thing for a vote like that though.
"There is a limit to how long she can hold it.  The Senate holds an actual trial, not just some hearing.  And when a U.S. citizen is accused of a crime by the government they have a Constitutional right to a speedy trial under the 6th Amendment.  The entire point of the 6th Amendment was to prevent exactly what Pelosi is doing, trying to carry out a trial long after a public announcement of charges or indictments.  Basically, it's to prevent the government from using its power to charge people with crimes as a political smear.  The defendant is entitled to have a speedy trial and either be cleared of the charges or convicted."
"So, yes, if she delays the charges for months and months until after the elections and then tries to present them, they'll be challenged under the 6th Amendment.  And there's a 99% chance the Supreme Court will say that if the president were to be tried on those charges that he had the right to a speedy trial.  They will make the House go back to the beginning and start all over with the impeachment process.  "
"However, there's also the other side to this.  The Senate doesn't care.  The president doesn't really care, either.  They all know he's not going to be removed from office, and they also know they aren't going to lose the Senate.  As long as the Senate is not bogged down in an impeachment trial, McConnell can keep on confirming judges at a record pace.  Even if Pelosi holds the articles until, say, October next year, the Senate will most like not challenge the process and will simply hold a few hearings to review the House's evidence and hear from the managers then vote to acquit.  I would doubt the trial even lasts five days altogether.  So even though they could challenge Pelosi delaying the trial they'd probably choose not to simply because it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on them or the president at all."
"I got and interesting timeline in mind: Pelosi waits it out until the election, Dems lose the House. Pelosi then tries to send the articles to the Senate but Mitch refuses to take them. New Congress begins. Trump sues on 6th Ammendment grounds. Impeachment goes back to House with now a Republican majority.  Gets voted down.  Trump now technically never impeached!"
"So, yes, if she delays the charges for months and months until after the elections and then tries to present them, they'll be challenged under the 6th Amendment. And there's a 99% chance the Supreme Court will say that if the president were to be tried on those charges that he had the right to a speedy trial. They will make the House go back to the beginning and start all over with the impeachment process. "
"And if the House ""flips"" in the 2020 election, then when they ""make the House go back to the beginning and start all over"" they would not even have enough votes on the 2nd go round to get it started."
"I would argue that the 6th ammendment would only apply to a court of law, not a House/ Senate preceding."
"Possibly, I would also argue that if the Articles aren't submitted within 30 days, that they become null and void."
I don't think that's how it works.
What's the time limit?
"There isn't one per the Constitution. I would imagine like what Obama should have done, Trump would have to sue the HoR and have the courts rule: Likely on whether the 6th amendment would be applicable or not."
"I would argue that the 6th ammendment would only apply to a court of law, "
"If Pelosi decides to play shenanigans, she might make the case for another amendment."
"The Constitution states that it applies to ""all criminal prosecutions.""  The impeachment is for criminal charges.  Abuse of power is an actual statutory violation of the federal code.  The 6th amendment applies.  The only difference between a Senate trial and an impeachment trial is that the Constitution limits the punishment in the Senate to removal from office and ineligibility to hold future office."
"I just realized this, and your point never comes into play. That's a dangerous argument if you are McConnell and don't want witnesses to be called. Can't have it both ways, and if you want the this impeachment to be treated as a trial, Dems will argue that they cannot be denied the chance to have witnesses called."
"No, the Senate can deny witnesses all day long.  Just like a regular judge could.  Because the Senate can impose the federal rules for evidence which would not allow any but two of the witnesses the Democrats called in the House.  Even in a regular criminal trial the defense can object to evidence and to witnesses for a number of reasons, and they can be prevented from being presented.  Because Democrats built their case primarily on hearsay evidence from people with no firsthand knowledge of the events in question, federal rules of evidence would not allow their testimony anyway.  And as for cabinet members, only the ones that were on the call in question would be allowed to testify, not cabinet members from the past who weren't involved, people like Bolton."
So Pelosi is holding on to the card to play at a time when she wants to gum up the Senate. Probably holding out for RBG. Then they will do everything in their power draw out the trial.
"As I recall she has 30 days from the ruling to deliver to Senate, so what is that now? 27 days?"
"There isn’t any set procedure in place, as this has only happens thrice. However, the way impeachment trials have gone before and the way the current congressional rules are written, the house needs to appoint managers to present their impeachment case to the senate. If these appoints aren’t made though, the case never moves forward. He is impeached, but no trial is set. That’s how pelosis been able to do this"
"Edit: actually I looked into it more and apparently this is the procedure for any impeachment, not just a president"
Why did the Democrats lie for 3 years about Russian collusion and obstruction of justice and not impeach the president? Do they take their voters as suckers? Yes
"Now that we have 2 articles of impeachment, I simply refuse to debate stuff like emoluments, obstruction of justice, Trumps taxes, campaign finance laws supposedly broken and everything else that has been left out.   It shuts the lefties down and pisses them off to the point of insane babbling when they realize that they don't have any more arguments except this weakass Ukraine shit that Biden is even more guilty of!"
Lol. You'll see those charges when trump's out. Don't you worry your little red hat off.
"Then why, pray tell, would they leave them out of the articles of impeachment, you know, the place where all the criminal indictments by the House against the POTUS are supposed to be?   That makes no sense at all."
Didn't realize i was in a trump reddit. 
"Oh I don't know. Maybe because they are criminal charges, and despite what most trump supporters think, this is not a criminal trial. Or perhaps there is a memo that says a sitting president. "
"When Trump is no longer president, who knows what might happen?"
"You are in a sub called <a href=""/r/Republican"">r/Republican</a>, FFS.  But then, you aren't called 'SmartJohnny' are you? "
"Here's where your thinking is incorrect.  The DOJ cannot bring criminal charges against a sitting POTUS, it's up to the House to bring charges via articles of impeachment.  All articles of impeachment in US History have listed actual criminal charges: for example, Clinton was impeached for Perjury and Obstruction of Justice.   Any other criminal charges that the House felt would be warranted, those things you think he would get charged with once out of office, those charges SHOULD be added to the articles of impeachment because it only makes the House case stronger.  Waiting to charge him once he is out of office makes NO SENSE."
"* <a href=""/u/GentleJohnny"">u/GentleJohnny</a> brings criminal charges against DJT.  Shows up to court in a pink vagina hat."
"I don't think so, they use the same playbook over and over again. So when trump is out the left will say ""wow even trump is better than &lt;insert next gop nominee here&gt;"
I seriously doubt that.
The investigation was never into Trump. It was to investigate foreign interference in our elections. It's just so happens your Lord emperor had 272 suspicious connections with corrupt Russian officials.
"Good, I wasn’t sure on that"
Just look at the Vegas odds. It was -500 that he would get impeached (bet 500 you receive 100) and the odds that’s he’s removed from office are -5000. It’s just comically polar and has nothing to do with bipartisan action.
"The way I understand it, Trump isn’t yet impeached by Congress until they officially present the article(s) of impeachment to the Senate. So technically, Trump is still not officially impeached."
I'll believe all this bluster when I see it. McConnell has disappointed before.

Buy back is a red herring. The failure of buy back gives evidence that the only way to remove the scary guns is to have police squads come through and take them. The only people who will rebel are the patriots. 
The blood of patriots running through into neighborhood storm drains is just another day in lib imagination land.
"How can you buy back something you never sold in the first place, call it what it is a mandatory disarmament of a sovereign people because their own government doesn't trust them with anything more dangerous than blunted safety scissors and even those are probably regulated to high hell."
"From what I understand, Australia's gun violence had been on a steady decline well before the ban. The ban hasn't shown a sharper decrease, but rather a small spike afterwards, then back to the same steady rate of decline."
"Also, they have only ""bought back"" <em>maybe</em> 10% of all the estimated guns and ammo after several years of implementation."
We get to see how Canada’s goes next.
"Canada is actually sane though on its gun laws, I don’t have to register anything if it’s a long gun, and we do background checks on any one buying a gun"
"Thats  pre-Trudeau. There about to confiscate all handguns and ""military assault weapons""."
I don’t have a hand gun or military assault weapon to hunt a bear. I guess it all boils down to if you don’t expect to have to hunt human in the coming while
I mean what do you think Trudeau’s definition of a military assault weapon is? 🤔 you sure something that can kill a bear will bypass the Liberals?
"I guess... I hope it will? I like Trudeau, I think he’s reasonable and a stand up politician. Doesn’t mean we give him everything he wants but we will fight for our gun rights"
Ah I think he’s improved and realized he’s been a bit too pushy since the election  but this plan to ban guns when there’s no research showing it’ll help is dumb and spending close to a billion when you’re running a large deficit is dumb.
True that
"Yeah there’s a fight going on in a few big cities because the have a problem with people murdering each other over drugs and such, besides that, they treat hunters pretty reasonable"

Man I'd have a lot of fun with those losers.
They should go to jail for sending this crap via the postal service. There should be laws against people this plainly stupid.
Send them MAGA hat and coffee mug :)
TDS
What state are they from?
State of confusion
Denial.
Not shocking in the slightest.
"Funny, EVERY Republican doesn't care what she has to say. I'm actually quite tired of her excessive verbal diarrhea. I wish she'd shut the hell up for a change, at least until someone can fetch her a shoe horn to pry her foot out of her mouth."
"Give her a break, verbal diarrhea is just a side affect of always being drunk."
An example of someone who has been in office waaayy too long - to the point she's letting the fanatics make the calls.
I don’t care what she has to say.
"No wonder she wants to dictate trial terms to the Senate.  She didn't care about what Republicans had to say it he House, and she doesn't care about them in the Senate either despite the fact that they run the Senate.  "
Let the bitch sit on her little impeachment vote.  Trump isn't impeached until she delivers them anyway.
"Well then honestly, she should resign. Any representative who is not willing to listen to both sides is no longer doing the job they were elected to do."
I'm kind of surprised she's being so honest.
What's drugs is she on so that i know to stay the hell away from them?
50 years of drinking and being perpetually angry.
Hag!!!!
When you think she is supposed to work with another party for the sake of her country. Who am I kidding?
Nancy only cares about herself. Dinosaur congressmen are the worst. There needs to be term limits

"I don't care what Republicans have to say either, now that they've decided their best path to political power is to lie about everything, shamelessly. Their open plan to ignore all evidence in the Senate trial is no different."
How can you be so sure it is the Republicans that are lying?  
IG report shows 17 intentional lies to obtain the FISA on Trump.  Trump was 100% right about Comey and his corruption. 
Zelensky said no Quid Pro Quo.
Transcript shows no Quid Pro Quo.
The “Whistlebower” (Eric C.) was not authorized to be on the call and therefore obtained his info illegally.  
Trump has the right to consult the Judiciary regarding the subpoena. (Democrats “charged” him with obstruction anyway.)
Trump has every right and even a responsibility to investigate the apparent corruption of the former VP.  
Delaying the impeachment is unconstitutional. Trump has the right to a trial.  
Partisan support against impeachment while only partisan support in favor of impeachment. 
I honestly think the Democrats are lying and misleading the country.  I think they have no case at all here. 
Make your case...if you can. (I don’t think you can)
"IG report concluded FBI was warranted in investigating Trump, even though Trump has spent three years LYING that it was a ""witch hunt"". Trump lies that Comey's a dirty cop, but Comey's not even charged with anything."
"Transcript shows quid pro quo: Military aid is mentioned, then the favor is requested. Sondland says, yes, quid pro quo. Mulvaney says quid pro quo - oops. Multiple other witnesses testified under oath that the president pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation - one NOT underway and one Ukraine's prosecutor says is baseless - into Joe and Hunter Biden, and into NOBODY ELSE, and the plain purpose was election interference. This is unlawful regardless of ""quid pro quo"", because, NO, presidents do NOT have the right to use the power of their office for personal gain. But the extortion is right there as plain as day."
"Did anyone testify under oath on behalf of the president? No. They all stonewalled, and the testimony in Congress stands unchallenged. Would he ""consult the judiciary"" by ignoring congressional subpoena if any of the requested witnesses could exonerate him under oath? No, they'd have testified. Instead, his lackeys go on Fox and lie with impunity because THERE they can't be charged with perjury. "
"Did the president ask American law enforcement to examine corruption in Ukraine? No. Didn't bother. Corruption ANYWHERE? Nope. There's no record of any official initiative against corruption in Ukraine or anywhere else. He just asked Ukraine to make an announcement about Biden, and it's all on record. And he used a personal attorney - showing it's personal business - as the point person. After all, this is a guy who just paid out $2 million for running a fraudulent charity. $25m for a fraudulent university. Corruption is his idea of how business works. "
"Onward: Does the Constitution impose any sort of timeframe on the House to send impeachment articles to the Senate?  No, that's a lie you're repeating. "
"Does Donald Trump get up each and every day and lie all day long about everything from minor trivial matters of vanity to important matters of national security? Oh, yes. He's a liar of unbelievable proportion. And when a guy with a long record of fraud and lying spins a story at odds with sworn testimony, at odds with common sense, without a single piece of exculpatory evidence, and pushes his version through a blizzard of bullshit on a friendly news station and social media rants, do you believe him?"
"Remarkably, your answer is yes."

Good. Let them remind every American just how much of an oppositionist joke their party has become in an election year.
"It's like they looked at Boris Johnson's landslide victory for Brexit a few weeks ago and thought, ""sure, the UK government had been standing in the way of what the people voted for for 3 years before getting kicked to the curb by the voters in a historic landslide; there's no way the exact same thing could possibly play out here."""
"If I were getting, I'd put Trump with both the popular vote and the electorial college this time. He's withstood three years of this onslaught and every Trump voter I know is planning on voting for him again. I doubt he has lost more votes than he has gained since being President."

BuT itS OBamAs EcONomY. 
I swear people who still say that are either stupid or in denial.
"A guy I work with just said the other day "" the economy started going up in 2014"" meaning this is Obamas doing, not Trump. I just walked away."
"To be fair, the economy was going up during Obama’s time, it’s true, but we had just went through a very rough recession so where else can it go but up, it’s a cycle. It would have gone up regardless of who was President. Trumps tax cuts were basically a stimulus package (going into debt to charge up the economy) and the effects of it are obvious and undeniable. I just wish we weren’t plunging even further into debt during such good times. This shits is never getting paid off. "
"Wonder which party is going to have the balls to ever tackle the country’s debt? We need a tea party v2, or would it be v3 at this point?"
Haha

Sounds like she needs to be removed from the FISA Court for extreme incompetence.
Or extreme partisanship.
Or you just read a single source and decided it was right based upon your own beliefs.
"No.  I read the same story from multiple sources over the past two days, and he's right.  These exact issues were discovered by the House and Senate investigations.  Nunes brought the evidence gathered by Congress to FISA and briefed them on it, including her.  And yet, they did nothing at all.  They have taken no corrective action whatsoever, not until the IG report came out publicly exposing the FBI's lies.  Now, think about this.  The FISA judges were told all of this long before we were, and yet they continued rubber stamping FISA warrants for months and months until publicly shamed.  That's not incompetence.  It's something else.  The above poster thinks it's partisanship, and that defintitely seems the most plausible explanation at this point."
That's not incompetence. It's something else.
I'd say it's a strong belief that what they're doing right and justified combined with the thought they'll never be held accountable.
Whatever this is called is what it is.
I'd say it's a strong belief that what they're doing right and justified combined with the thought they'll never be held accountable.
"Don't you think that's a bit of a contradiction in terms, though?  I mean, if you believe that what you're doing is right and justified, why would even think about the idea of being held accountable?  If being held accountable is at the forefront of your mind, it speaks to consciousness of guilt."
Imagine you've been rubber stamping every application that's come across the bench for over a decade.   Some cursory questions to make the appearance you're interested.
"Then, a congressman shows up with evidence you have been duped and it's quite possible it's TRUE and you're about to be exposed.  Doing something about it would expose yourself.  Waiting for the IG gives them an out.   It wasnt the FISA court, it was the FBI lying to us.  Shrug.emoji "

Are there really still people out there dumb enough to identify as a Democrat? I think not.
"My God, the comments in that linked thread..."
"It was theft and destruction of property, done to intimidate a legally designated protected class, ie a hate crime."
No one got punished for making a joke. 
"Spewing b.s. like this is how we get to where half the country hates (not disagrees, but hates) the other half, and the feelings become mutual."
15 years for burning an LGBTQ flag is acceptable to you?!? Now let’s compare this to stealing and burning an American flag.
I'm sorta mixed on this.
"The Judge might be virtue signalling by giving him that punishment, but the guy took the rainbow flag from a liberal church and burned it in a strip club parking lot. He also had priors. His name being Adolfo is unfortunate and funny, but not part of the issue. That's at least property theft and vandalism. Hate crime status if it's involved might be a factor too, even if I think it's stupid. Plus I'm 99 percent certain he got kicked out of the strip club."
"So like I get that the first knee jerk reaction is to claim LGBTQ people are going to take away free speech, but like had he just bought a rainbow flag and burned it on his own property, it would be completely legal assuming it's not like a dry season or something."
You can't just take something from a church and set it on fire and claim free speech.
You know it’s a misdemeanor to steal up to like 2 grand. A lot of the liberal cities made it like a citation even. Yet you steal a LGTBQ flag—15 years!
"The kicker is that he also commited arson, and combined with the hate crime upgrade it went from misdemenor to felony. There's also harassment in there but the hate crime upgrade and prior offender status is probably what made it go from a fine to jailtime."
It's not like this is his first time ever breaking the law. Plus arson is kind of illegal too.
How is that a hate crime? Unless it was literally a gay church then not a hate crime. And that’s ridiculous you can get charged with hate crime for something like that. The court has ruled burning flags are protected under freeedom of speech. So this would mean that means you can be charged with a hate crimes for speech.
"In this case, this guy stole a flag from a church, set it on fire (third degree arson), then told the judge he did it because he was making a statement about gay people."
"So for starters, I feel like the guy would've been better served just pleading not guilty and getting a plea deal. Instead he self incriminates himself in court. edit: He also told the media he did it because of his animosity to gay people. Instead of pleading the 5th, shutting up, and hiring a lawyer."
"Secondly, I think people confuse free speech with the freedom to do whatever you want. You can protest, but once you start rioting or looting it's super illegal. Maybe just not commit crimes while protesting and you should arguably be fine."
"Third, the pastor of the church the guy stole the flag from is a lesbian. Some churches do support LGBT and it honestly doesn't surprise me that the court would take that into consideration when charging him."
"I'm not saying you should be arrested for burning rainbow flags, I'm saying if you're gonna burn a rainbow flag just buy one on amazon and burn it on your own property. Way less headaches."
Or just tell people not to go to that church because they're false prophets or something. Boycotts are a good option.
"I didn’t justify the length of the sentence. I did not say I was okay with it. I don’t try to argue on the opinion, only point out where there are factual inaccuracies being presented as the truth."
"As for stealing an American flag and burning it, well, that’s theft and destruction of property so it gets a punishment from the legal system. However, since the American flag wouldn’t represent a legally designated protected class, it would not qualify as a hate crime (to the best of my knowledge)."
"Doesn’t this guy also have a long list of priors, which lengthened his sentence?"
"We need more people like you, y'know, people with actual common sense, 15 years does seem excessive and I'm all for gay pride but the law is the law."
There’s a woman in Indianapolis that got 4 years for running over and killing some children at a bus stop. :|

"""Protected class?""  Give a damn break."
"Yes, a protected class. "
"Per wiki “U.S. federal law protects individuals from discrimination or harassment based on the following nine protected classes: sex, race, age, disability, color, creed, national origin, religion, or genetic information”."
These have been upheld time and again in the Supreme Court (including by supreme courts with majorities chosen by conservative presidents).

You want to start killing people over this shit?The man broke the law. Wtf. Calm down. I don’t get this whole civil war faction I’m seeing in this party. Things are not so bad that we need to start killing people. Do you really want to see this country implode like that? 
Nothing would make our enemies happier then to see us killing each other. Especially over dumb shit like this.

Haha. It would certainly appear that way to someone that’s obviously brainwashed by who knows what. I hesitate to say by the far right bc that would group you with Republicans. You’ve obviously gone beyond that if your serious about killing fellow Americans in a civil war over the issues we face today. Take your hate somewhere else. You make real republicans look bad posting here.
"You're the reason we are going to civil war, you refuse to understand."

"“One significant caveat is the limited sample in this study. We only examined undergraduate students from one university, so the findings are not as generalizable. Therefore, one major question remaining is the question of whether or not these findings generalize to the public at large,” Medlin explained. """
​
"“Additionally, there are still more factors that could influence attitudes towards scientific information that we have not yet examined. There are many more directions that this research could go in. For instance, I am currently designing a study manipulating how scientific information is communicated.” "
the title of this article is a manipulation for sure
"I've always found liberals to have little to no interest in actual science.  They are more interested in adopting scientific-sounding talking points to bolster their political talking points.  If you want to know the dead giveaway for someone who thinks like this, it's whenever you hear the words ""the science is settled."""
"No.  <strong>Science is NEVER settled!</strong>  That's is a wholly unscientific way of thinking.  Yet, liberals will shout it from the rooftops while claiming some sort of monopoly on scientific truth (ironic as there is no ""truth"" in science)."
You should read “the relatively of wrong” by Isaac Asimov. 
"Some things are settled. 
Evolution is a fact... 
smoking is bad for you...
The earth is spherical...."
Lots of things are settled
"You should familiarize yourself with the concept of levels of description.  To oversimplify it, it's that idea that a given thing is true... until it's not."
Read the relativity of wrong. It’s a relatively short essay. 
Plus Isaac Asimov is one of the best authors ever.

Damn that really opened my mind about that. Sorry for being butt hurt just upset by the meme. I guess gun control wouldn’t really help that much at all.
"I don’t think anyone can’t stand the thought of an innocent child getting hurt by a gun, or anything for that matter. It’s absolutely horrible. We have tremendous gun control as it is with over 300 gun control laws already in effect, and the cities with the strictest gun laws have the worst gun crime stats. 99 % of gun owners follow the laws to a tee. It’s a very small percentage committing the crimes with guns. It’s like putting your grandpa in prison because you robbed a bank. Severely punish the person who commits the crime, not the innocent person who follows the law."
"This is the thought I have whenever the media propagandizes anything.  It’s sad whenever some lunatic goes crazy and murders someone, but many millions of other gun owners murdered no one today."

"I'm on the fence about this. While I do think it's an important Republican position to support police and Law/Order, I think it is equally a Republican position to safeguard individual liberty."
"The truth is, when individual liberties are violated, In a Constitutionally meaningful way, it is usually the police doing it. That means we also have to hold bad police accountable."
"Well yeah we should hold all bad people accountable for bad actions, but the current trend of ""All cops are bastards"" and ""Fuck the police, they sending people to jail so they go out of their way to frame people"" I've seen is sad af, especially since so many cops get gunned down for bs reasons like the one mentioned in the article. It's like getting crappy service at a Walmart and thinking all employees at every Walmart are exactly like that one"
"Well, cops could start holding other cops accountable when they shoot civilians, instead of putting them on administrative leave with pay and then finding no fault.  They could also stop taking civilians’s possessions through asset forfeiture until there has been a conviction.   And cops could focus on crime reduction instead of revenue generation, perhaps ticket revenue could go to something else besides the police department.  Like parks, or homeless shelters or food banks.  That way you remove the incentive to write tickets to pad the police budget.   Just a few ideas to help the police begin to rebuild their credibility."
This has been going on since Obama fueled this BS.

In truth the rules have been disregarded as far as due process. So it's safe to assume no one does.
Democrats create hyperbolic sensationalism to justify their BS and the sheep in all of their bias to support them. 
"Sad to say, they only do what people will allow and we deserve this. This was a great civic lesson at the very least."
"Hey, canadian here. Curious on how Trump was not given due process and I would love to hear more. Impeachment and related issues were not covered in very much detail around where I live so I don’t get to hear much about it. Would you (or anyone else for that matter) mind explaining how exactly he wasn’t provided due process and what dems could have done better? "
"NOTE : I AM NOT CLAIMING HE WAS OR WASN’T, SIMPLY ASKING FOR DETAILS."
Hello northern neighbor.
In any criminal case you have the defendant and the plaintiff. 
"The defendant stands trial to answer for his crimes. The crime alleged is heard by the jury and a verdict is rendered based on precedent, and guilt."
"Precedent can be looked at how frequent the crime is committed. In the case of the phone call, Obama was on hot mic telling Russia he would have more leverage when he gets reelected so there goes precedent. Along with Biden who boasted about it."
Next you have guilt. Did the Democrats sell the case that Trump attempted to quid pro quo an ally? He stated do us a favor and the charge of bribery was not put to him.
"As to your question, due process. In a hearing the defense and the accused can call witnesses. In the plaintiff hearings we heard from the plaintiffs witnesses and the Republicans being a minority of the house in the 2018 elections called for a minority hearing where they get to call their witnesses."
"This was not abided by and completely unethical. You get one side of the story and misleads the jury. In this case, the American people. Imagine if you only heard one side of the story and had to render a verdict. "
"So, by disregarding the Republicans request which was stated multiple times the Democrats cabled into a hurry up this trial to impeach not giving the minority their day in court."
Thank you for reaching out and I hope this helped.
"Hey, thanks for the quick response. I really appreciate it. I’ll be sure to take everything into consideration but I just wanted to correct a little something you mentioned. The reason no witnesses were present to advocate for the republicans is because democrats issued subpeonas to those republican witnesses and tried to get them to show up, yet the witnesses refused. Please, before answering this look it up. This is not a matter of partisanship, being from a different country I do not take sides in your politics but this is a fact. Many people involved (including the president) refused to show up and that is the reason those witnesses did not show up. "
"That being said, I just wanted to thank you again for taking the time to tell me about what you had heard and I wish you a wonderful day (or night depending on when you are reading this)!"
A subpoena is a request from congress. They are not court summons because that is the Executive branch which Trump is.
The Republicans requested to call their witnesses which was denied which is due process.
Trump most likely told the Dems no because they could any questions to his staff under oath.
From what they did with a phone call and a fake Russia investigation would you want them talking to your inner circle?
Sorry for being rude. A wonderful day to you as well. Happy new year.
"I didn’t explain myself well but it’s ok. Either way, thanks for the time and happy new year to you too!"
It’s kind of absurd that the right wing subreddits are more objective than politics or world politics.
"Reddit is filled with a bunch of teenagers and college students that think that Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Greta Thunderbird are gonna save the planet."
Who do you think is going to save the planet?
Trump. Well as least he’s gonna save this country. I’m not sure about the world
"I’m Independent and went to the political sub saying the impeachment is just strengthening Trump which is true and the amount of backlash I got and stupidity I received was of the charts. Now I am a Tulsi supporter and if she doesn’t get the nod I will write her name in. I

What has Trump done since being in office that is against Republican values?

Agreed.  But policy wise he has been great.  I feel many politicians could spend less money on many things including golf.

That's fair.
I'd like to take a moment to thank all those Democrats that endorsed the President's re- election in 2020 on their way out the door.
All this has accomplished is stronger party divides through the country and fired up Trump supporters. He is gonna ride this into re-election and it's gonna be a blast to watch.
There is going to be a huge voter turnout for trump in 2020. Lots of angry motivated voters.
I have never voted in my life. Never follow politics. I would say I'm an independent person when it comes to political issues. I will register to vote in 2020 for Trump. After doing my own research and fact checking it appears the Democrats don't care about facts.
No kidding.
Welcome aboard!
"Hey, could you give me some examples? I often hear the opposite and I would love to get your thoughts on the matter, specifically those relating to impeachment and why trump should or should not have been impeached. Thanks!"
"Democrats arent really against abuse of power. They are against people using their power to investigate their people. When Obama, the FBI, the DOJ, Adam Schiff abuse their power it is justified.  When Trump tries to investigate Biden for his abuse of power, that suddenly is a crime and an abuse of power."
"To be fair, worst case scenario didn’t Hunter just use his name for that position?  Joe isn’t even VP anymore. What power is he abusing?"
He witheld US aid money in order to get them to fire a prosecutor that was imvestigating his son’s company that was paying his son $80k a month. That doesnt soumd corrupt to you?
"It would, if that was even possible. Biden wasn’t VP or even in a position to withhold anything. The aid withholding all happened under the current administration. Whether Ukraine paid Hunter a handsome salary due to his connections is certainly possible, but it certainly wasn’t because Joe had any pressure to apply.  Maybe they thought he had a shot at the White House in 2020 and it might extol some influence later. If Joe let them believe that I dislike him even more (he’s already my least favorite democratic nominee), but he certainly didn’t force their hand or abuse any power to make it happen.  Look to the current administration if you’re looking for an answer on that one."
"For your information. <a href=""https://youtu.be/UXA--dj2-CY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/UXA--dj2-CY</a>"
"The timeline of events don't marry up to his comments though (Shokin was fired months after Biden's trip).  That said, if Joe used any of his influence at the time (I thought a lot of this occurred after 2016) then he absolutely deserves to have this haunt him in 2020 and I hope it does.  But I also stand by the fact that it is not the President's place to do this.  There is SO much corruption in this world and within our system going on RIGHT NOW, and to focus phone calls, correspondence, White House staff and television air time on something from years ago that the dust has already completely settled on just to smear a political opponent is absolutely an abuse of his station."

I disagree. Clinton was impeached and ask the democrats if he was a bad president. Trump will be the first president ever to be impeached that goes on to win re-election.
He'll also be the first impeached president to be acquitted of all charges
"Johnson and Clinton were found <a href=""https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm"">Not Guilty</a> by the Senate; I don't think that anyone reasonably expects a different outcome with Trump's trial."
Not yet. Senate has to vote on that. Should happen.
History is what the people in power want it to be honestly. It won’t change his legacy. There were presidents throughout our history that during their terms were disliked and insulted but in hindsight did a great job.
You sir know History!  In fact a President whose election triggered a Civil War is on Mount Rushmore. I think it’s safe to say he was the most hated man in the country at that time.  
"History looks at accomplishments!  From this point on, unemployment numbers for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and many more groups will be measured against Trump’s numbers. The value of the Stock Market will be judged against Trump’s numbers. The number of judges confirmed to federal courts will be measured against s Trump’s  numbers. Many other important measures of economic indicators will be measured against Trump’s.  Yeah TDS will be around long after Trump goes back to civilian life."
"If it goes through the senate then yes. Pretty sure it needs to go through both house and senate before its ""official""."
Could be wrong.
love this!
"Technically by the letter of the law and Constitution, until the Dem's put forth the articles to the Senate and send forth their representatives and officially announce to the Senate the results, Trump is not impeached."
"The Democrats voted on it and it passed but it has to go to the Senate to become official, them holding onto it means it has not yet been recognized."
[removed]
"you sound mad bud, clinton lost get over it"
Hmm so you are saying the electoral college worked then? The majority is not always the will of the people.
"Now i can see why Trump called the Democrats ""Do-Nothing-Democrats"" because how can Congress solve any of your country's problems with one party only focusing to topple the other."
"Ok, boomer"

Did you even read the article?

awesome!
Trump 2020!
Why is this NSFW?
Because he’s just too damn sexy 💕👌🏻
Toss the fascist democrats out of office next year  - get them all out
I don’t think the dems realize that this is going to bring more people who lean more towards the left completely to the right. More votes and more years of greatness!
Trump 2020. 😌
He didn’t get impeached
What’s the reasoning behind the attempted impeachment tho?
They said he abused his power
"He was 100% impeached.   Impeachment doesn’t mean removal from office, it means the House passed the articles.  That said, this picture is awesome and I look forward to posting it in November when he wins in a landslide."
Oh ok
Very true. It was just the vote.
😁

I dont think we need reforms. I think we just need to hold those accountable who abused and misused the FISA court.

What are your thoughts on Comey admitting to “being wrong” and “sloppy” after testifying countless of times under oath?

"Not unless they actually deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate.  Impeachment isn't just one vote.  It's a vote, a trial, and a verdict."
Thats the point that the article illustrates.
Nope!!
They WISH but no

I think when it comes down to it this is exactly why he is loved - he speaks like a real person.  Other presidents carefully choose every word and filter it through polling data and focus groups before they say it.  Trump is a stream of consciousness.  His 2nd inaugural speech is going to be absolutely priceless.  I bet he turns around and looks right at that old witch pelosi and lights her up on national tv.

"Really, you reached all the way out to a hitler comparison?"
I love it when he calls it for what it is.
Amen!!!

“We never wanted to do this!”
Says the guy who’s party has been trying this since day 1
Who are they kidding?
It's their 'wet dream' come true.
Top Democrat lies.
"Well, several Dems ran on ""impeaching the mother fucker."""
One of them got up and said that her son convinced her <em>last year</em> to impeach him.
"Al Green has twice introduced impeachment articles, the first got about 50 votes, the second got almost 100."
"Yeah, they've been wanting to do this since he got elected."
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
"it’s like that ex-wife who tells her ex-husband “you made me cheat” lol, unbelievable"
"What a load of ""bullschiff"". They Democrats know exactly what they want to happen to our duly elected president. And the Democrats talk this with deep ""sadness"", give us a break. The real American people see right through this, this is has to be biggest chunk of bullshit lies I've ever heard."
